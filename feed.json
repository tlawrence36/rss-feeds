      "NEW YORK -- A Manhattan jury will resume deliberations Friday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s sex crimes retrial after ending its first day without reaching a verdict in a case that encapsulated the #MeToo movement.",
      "The panel, which was handed the case Thursday morning, has requested to hear a readback of some testimony from two of Weinstein's accusers, as well as to see medical records from one of those women.",
      "The jury of seven women and five men is considering two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape against the 73-year-old Oscar-winning movie producer, with the criminal sex act charges the higher-degree felonies. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein propelled the #MeToo movement in 2017.",
      "He was eventually convicted of sex crimes in New York and California, but the New York conviction was overturned last year, leading to the retrial before a new jury and a different judge.",
      "Jurors heard more than five weeks of testimony, including lengthy testimony from three accusers.",

    "story": [
      "The blockbuster horror film \u201cSinners\u201d features the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in a short, but impactful scene",
      "CHOCTAW, Miss. -- It\u2019s a small part in a big movie, but for the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, their scene in \"Sinners\" is a huge deal.",
      "The horror movie blockbuster, starring Michael B. Jordan as a gangster turned vampire slayer, paints a brief but impactful portrait of the tribe using Choctaw actors and cultural experts. For some, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve seen the Choctaw way of life accurately portrayed on the big screen.",
      "In the scene, a posse of Choctaw, riding on horseback and in an old truck, arrives at a small farmhouse to warn the couple that lives there of coming danger. When the couple refuses their help, a Choctaw man wishes them luck in his native language before riding off.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve not seen another movie that has our language, like, spoken correctly,\u201d said Cynthia Massey, a cultural consultant for \u201cSinners.\u201d",
      "Massey runs the tribe\u2019s Chahta Immi Cultural Center alongside Sherrill Nickey and department director Jay Wesley. All three were hired as cultural consultants to ensure a genuine depiction of the tribe in the film. Together, they sifted through archives, researching how their ancestors would have dressed, spoken and acted in the 1930s, when \u201cSinners\u201d takes place.",
      "\u201cI was honored and humbled by the fact that they wanted a true representation,\u201d said Wesley, who also acted in the movie.",
      "Wesley connected the filmmakers to Choctaw actors and artifacts like the beaded sashes the Choctaw characters wear in the movie. Those sashes are now part of a \u201cSinners\u201d display at the cultural center.",
      "The movie's introduction also features a short snippet of a Choctaw war chant, performed by Wesley\u2019s daughter, Jaeden Wesley, who is a student at the University of California, Los Angeles. While recording, Jaeden Wesley said the filmmakers told her they wanted the Choctaw people to hear their music in the movie.",
      "\u201cWe were catering to our own people, even in that short little second,\u201d Jaeden Wesley said.",
      "Shining a spotlight on often overlooked cultures and topics, like the Choctaw people, is part of the mission at Proximity Media, which produced \u201cSinners.\u201d The company was founded by \u201cSinners\u201d director Ryan Coogler, his wife and film producer, Zinzi Coogler, and producer Sev Ohanian.",
      "\u201cIt was never a question for us that if we were going to portray the Mississippi Choctaw, we got to have the right people who can tell us, who can tell Ryan, what we\u2019re not knowing, what we\u2019re not thinking,\u201d Ohanian said. \u201cIt was all because we\u2019re trying to serve Ryan\u2019s story of like putting truth on screen.\"",
      "Ohanian and his co-founders didn\u2019t stop with Choctaw consultants; they enlisted a small army of experts who advised on the confluence of cultures mingling in the Mississippi Delta, where the film is set. The resulting cinematic world was so well received, community organizers penned an open letter, inviting Coogler and his fellow filmmakers to visit the Delta. Last week, the Cooglers, Ohanian and others took up the offer, attending a \u201cSinners\u201d screening in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Clarksdale is where the film's events unfold.",
      "\u201cI hope this encourages other filmmakers to find opportunities to be authentic in their storytelling and to look at this rich tapestry of culture that\u2019s right here in America,\u201d Ohanian said, noting the film industry has historically misrepresented nonwhite groups.",
      "For Wesley and his fellow consultants, the hope is the film will cultivate curiosity in audiences, encourage them to learn more about Choctaw culture and visit the Chahta Immi Cultural Center.",
      "\u201cIt's important to be connected to this culture because this was here before the public was here,\u201d Massey said. \u201cProbably three-quarters of Mississippi was Choctaw land, and now we only have 350,000 acres.\u201d",
      "They say Choctaw participation in the film has cultivated a sense of pride among tribe members. Nickey hopes it will encourage a sort of cultural renaissance at a time when she says fewer and fewer Choctaw speak their native language.",
      "\u201cI know for a fact that there are a lot of kids out there that don't even know how to speak our language. They only speak English,\u201d Nickey said. \u201cI hope they know it's okay to speak our language.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Years before Ana de Armas was using an ice skate to slice a neck in \u201cFrom the World of John Wick: Ballerina,\u201d she co-starred with Keanu Reeves in a much different film.",
      "The erotic thriller \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d released in 2015, was de Armas\u2019 first Hollywood film. De Armas, born and raised in Cuba, had just come to Los Angeles after acting in Spain. English was new to her, so she had to learn her lines phonetically.",
      "\u201cIt was tough and I felt miserable at times and very lonely,\u201d she says in an interview. \u201cBut I wanted to prove myself. I remember being in meetings with producers and they would be like, \u2018OK, I\u2019ll see you in a year when you learn English.\u2019 Before I left the office, I would say, \u2018I\u2019ll see you in two months.\u2019\u201d",
      "Since \u201cKnock Knock,\u201d her rise to stardom has been one of the last decade's most meteoric. She was radiant even as a hologram in \u201cBlade Runner 2049.\u201d She stole the show in Rian Johnson\u2019s star-studded \u201cKnives Out.\u201d She breezed through the Bond movie \u201cNo Time to Die.\u201d She was Oscar nominated for her Marilyn Monroe in \u201cBlonde. \u201d",
      "And now, 10 years after those scenes with Reeves, de Armas is for the first time headlining a big summer action movie. In \u201cBallerina,\u201d in theaters Friday, de Armas\u2019 progressive development as an unlikely action star reaches a butt-kicking crescendo, inheriting the mantle of one of the most esteemed, high-body-count franchises.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big moment in my career, and I know that. I can see that,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me look back in many ways, just being with Keanu in another film in such a different place in my career. It definitely gives me perspective of the journey and everything since we met. Things have come far since then.\u201d",
      "While de Armas, 37, isn\u2019t new to movie stardom, or the tabloid coverage that comes with it, many of her career highlights have been streaming releases. \u201cThe Gray Man\u201d and \u201cBlonde\u201d were Netflix. \u201cGhosted\u201d was Apple TV+. But \u201cBallerina\u201d will rely on de Armas (and abiding \u201cJohn Wick\u201d fandom) to put moviegoers in seats.",
      "Heading in, analysts expected an opening weekend of around $35-40 million, which would be a solid result for a spinoff that required extensive reshoots. Reviews, particularly for de Armas playing a ballerina-assassin, have been good.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d says director Len Wiseman. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot to carry all on her shoulders. But she\u2019ll be the first person to tell you: \u2018Put it on. Let me carry the weight. I\u2019m totally game.\u2019\u201d",
      "De Armas, whose talents include the ability to be present and personable on even the most frenzied red carpets, has done the globe-trotting work to make \u201cBallerina\u201d a big deal: appearing at CinemaCon, gamely eating hot wings and cheerfully deflecting questions about her next film, \u201cDeeper,\u201d with Tom Cruise.",
      "Yet for someone so comfortable in the spotlight, one of the more interesting facts about de Armas is that she lives part time in that bastion of young A-listers: Vermont.",
      "\u201cYeah, it surprised many people,\u201d she says, chuckling. \u201cAs soon as I went up there, I knew that was going to be a place that would bring me happiness and sanity and peace. But I know for a Cuban who doesn\u2019t like cold very much, it\u2019s very strange.\u201d",
      "Winding up in northern New England is just as unexpected as landing an action movie like \u201cBallerina.\u201d She grew up with the conviction, from age 12, that she would be an actor. But she studied theater.",
      "\u201cI never thought I was going to do action,\u201d de Armas says. \u201cWhat was relatable for me was watching Cuban actors on TV and in movies. That was my reality. That\u2019s all I knew, so the actors I looked up to were those.\u201d",
      "De Armas also had bad asthma, which makes some of the things she does in \u201cBallerina\u201d \u2014 a movie with a flamethrower duel \u2014 all the more remarkable to her.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d she remembers. \u201cI couldn\u2019t run. I sometimes couldn\u2019t play with my friends. I had to just be home and be still so I wouldn\u2019t get an asthma attack. So I never thought of myself as someone athletic or able to run just a block. So this has been a surprise.\u201d",
      "At 14, she auditioned and got into Havana\u2019s National Theatre of Cuba. Four years later, with Spanish citizenship through her grandparents, she moved to Madrid to pursue acting. When she arrive in LA in 2014, she had to start all over again.",
      "Now as one of the top Latina stars in Hollywood, she's watched as immigrant paths like hers have grow increasingly arduous if not impossible. The day after she spoke to The Associated Press, the Trump administration announced a travel ban on 12 countries and heavy restrictions on citizens of other countries, including Cuba.",
      "\u201cI got here at a time when things were definitely easier in that sense,\u201d says de Armas, who announced her then-imminent U.S. citizenship while hosting \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2023. \u201cSo I just feel very lucky for that. But it\u2019s difficult. Everything that\u2019s going on is very difficult and very sad and really challenging for many people. I definitely wish things were different.\u201d",
      "Chad Stahelski, director of the four \u201cJohn Wick\u201d films and producer of \u201cBallerina,\u201d was about to start production on \u201cJohn Wick: Chapter 4\u201d when producer Basil Iwanyk and Nathan Kahane, president of Lionsgate, called to set up a Zoom about casting de Armas. He quickly watched every scene she had been in.",
      "\u201cHow many people would have played the Bond girl kind of goofy like that?\u201d he says. \u201cI know that I can harden people up. I know I can make them the assassin, but getting the charm and the love and the humor out of someone is trickier. But she had it.\u201d",
      "In \u201cKnives Out,\u201d Stahelski saw someone who could go from scared and uncertain to a look of \u201cI'm going to stab you in the eye.\u201d",
      "\u201cI like that in my action heroes,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to see the stoic, superhero vibe where everything\u2019s going to be OK.\u201d",
      "But it wasn\u2019t just her acting or her charisma that convinced Stahelski. It was her life story.",
      "\u201c'John Wick' is all hard work \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean just in the training. You\u2019ve got to love it and put yourself out there,\u201d says Stahelski. \u201cWhen you get her story about how she came from the age of 12, got into acting, what she sacrificed, what she did, that\u2019s what got my attention. \u2018Oh, she\u2019s a perseverer. She doesn\u2019t just enjoy the view, she enjoys the climb.\u2019\u201d",
      "When that quote is read back to her, de Armas laughs, and agrees.",
      "\u201cBeing Cuban, and my upbringing and my family and everything I\u2019ve done, I\u2019ve never had a plan B,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve never had that thing of, \u2018Well, if it doesn\u2019t work, my family can help.\u2019 Or, \u2018I can do this other career.\u2019 This was it. And I also knew, besides being the thing I loved the most, this was my survival. This is how I live. This is how I feed myself and my family. So it\u2019s also a sense of, I don\u2019t know, responsibility.\u201d",
      "That makes her reflect back to when she was just trying to make it in Hollywood, sounding out words, trying not to disappoint directors whose instructions she could barely understand, trying not to be intimidated by the action star across from her who had just finished shooting the first \u201cJohn Wick.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so committed to do it,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so invested in the trying of it, just giving it a shot. When I give something a shot, I try my best, whatever that is. Then I can actually say: I gave it a shot.\u201d",

      "Jurors have started deliberating in Harvey Weinstein\u2019s New York sex crimes retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- Jurors started deliberating Thursday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s New York sex crimes retrial, tasked with deciding \u2014 again \u2014 a case that encapsulated the #MeToo movement.",
      "The seven-woman, five-man jury is considering two counts of criminal sex act and one count of rape, each relating to a different accuser and a different date. In this case, the criminal sex act charge is the higher-degree felony. The jury got the case after a juror was replaced by an alternate after she couldn\u2019t come to court due to illness.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Nearly eight years ago, a series of sexual misconduct allegations against the Oscar-winning movie producer propelled the #MeToo movement. Some of those accusations later generated criminal charges and convictions in New York and California.",
      "The New York conviction from 2020 was subsequently overturned, leading to the retrial before a new jury and a different judge.",
      "Jurors heard more than five weeks of testimony, including lengthy and sometimes fiery questioning of Weinstein's three accusers in the case.",
      "Jessica Mann said he raped her in 2013, when she was trying to build an acting career. Miriam Haley accused him of forcibly performing oral sex on her in 2006, when she was looking for work in entertainment production.",
      "Kaja Sokola, who wasn't involved in Weinstein's first trial, told jurors that he forced oral sex on her, too, during 2006. At the time, she was a teenage fashion model trying to break into acting.",
      "\u201cThey all had dreams of pursuing careers in the defendant's world, the entertainment industry,\u201d prosecutor Nicole Blumberg told jurors in her closing argument Tuesday. She contended that Weinstein let the women think he was interested in their careers when what actually interested him were their bodies, and \"he was going to have their bodies and touch their bodies whether they wanted him to or not.\u201d",
      "Weinstein chose not to testify. His defense called other witnesses, including some former friends of Sokola's and Mann's.",
      "Weinstein's attorneys argued that all three accusers consented to Weinstein's advances because they wanted help with their Hollywood aims. All three stayed on friendly terms with him afterward, a point the defense emphasized.",
      "\u201cIt's transactional, folks. Yes, he wants to fool around with them, and yes, they want something from him,\u201d defense lawyer Arthur Aidala said in his summation Tuesday.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not identify people without their permission if they say they have been sexually assaulted. Sokola, Mann and Haley have agreed to be named.",

    "story": [
      "The long-running gang case involving Atlanta rapper Young Thug will end without a single murder conviction",
      "ATLANTA -- Three years after Atlanta rapper Young Thug and 27 others were indicted on gang and racketeering charges, followed by a long, problem-plagued trial, nobody will be convicted of murder.",
      "When Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced the indictment in May 2022, she said her office was cracking down on a violent street gang responsible for multiple killings run by Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams.",
      "But Willis dropped the only remaining murder charge Monday after defendant Demise McMullen pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault. Young Thug went home Oct. 31 after pleading guilty to gang, drug and gun charges and remains on probation.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug and two others founded the street gang Young Slime Life, which was associated with the Bloods street gang, in 2012. The 33-year-old artist has a record label called Young Stoner Life, which prosecutors alleged was tied to Young Slime Life.",
      "Prosecutors drew ire for using song lyrics and social media posts in their case. Attorney Doug Weinstein, who represented defendant Deamonte Kendrick, who raps under the name Yak Gotti, said prosecutors targeted men who pursued music as a way out of hardship in economically \u201cdeprived\u201d Atlanta areas and tried to \u201cclaw them back in, hold them back down.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever they may have done in their youth, and I would argue most of them didn't do anything, to be targeted in this way by the prosecutors is just wrong,\u201d said Weinstein. \u201cWhatever you think of their music \u2014 the violence, the misogynistic lyrics \u2014 that is not a reason to go after these guys.\u201d",
      "Weinstein continued, adding, \u201cPeople like my client, Mr. Kendrick, had to be incarcerated for 2 1/2 years or more, in the case of some of these defendants, for a crime that they didn\u2019t do.\"",
      "Kendrick was stabbed in jail. He was one of two defendants who didn\u2019t take plea deals, and the only one cleared of all charges, including a murder charge in the 2015 drive-by shooting death of rival gang member Donovan Thomas Jr., known as \u201cBig Nut.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Willis spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said \u201canti-gang efforts\u201d have yielded \u201cover 400 convictions of gang members\" since Willis became district attorney, including 19 people in this case. Those efforts were \u201ckey\u201d in making Fulton County \"safer, taking dangerous offenders off the streets and sending a message that gang activity will not be tolerated in our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Willis prosecuted the case using Georgia's broad anti-racketeering law. Critics say using that law caused a messy trial by roping in dozens of people with varying levels of alleged culpability. The anti-racketeering law allows prosecutors to present evidence that might otherwise not be allowed, which some defense attorneys say lets prosecutors present irrelevant material to the jury. It also often leads to people being held in jail longer for multiple reasons.",
      "\u201cIt made everything so much more complicated and cumbersome,\u201d said Max Schardt, defense attorney for defendant Shannon Stillwell.",
      "Stillwell was among five codefendants who stood trial alongside Young Thug beginning in November 2023.",
      "After Young Thug and the others entered guilty pleas, Stillwell and Kendrick were the only ones who took their chances with a jury. They were found not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges in December. Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdict came nearly two years after jury selection began.",
      "Nine other defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. Twelve defendants were split from the original trial, and charges against six of them were dismissed in early December. Another recently got a murder charge dismissed after entering an Alford plea, which allows him to maintain his innocence while acknowledging that it is in his best interest to plead guilty.",
      "McMullen, who was also charged with murder in Thomas' killing, entered an Alford plea to a lesser aggravated assault charge and another count of violating the anti-racketeering law. A judge in this case sentenced him to 40 years, with 20 to be served in confinement at the same time as the sentence he's already serving, and 20 suspended for time served. That leaves one remaining defendant who is accused of shooting and wounding an Atlanta police officer in February 2022 while on probation. His fate is expected to be determined soon.",
      "Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman, who was not involved in the case, said Willis could have secured guilty pleas years ago without a long, expensive trial if she hadn't used the anti-racketeering law.",
      "\u201cShe went for a home run, and she didn\u2019t get it,\u201d said Fleischman.",

      "As if a movie about sharks wasn't scary enough, the filmmakers behind \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d have upped the screams by adding what every thriller needs \u2014 a serial killer.",
      "While that may sound like very dangerous moviemaking, the result is actually taut and well crafted, a worthy birthday present to \u201cJaws,\u201d celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals\u201d stars Jai Courtney as an Australian boat captain who likes feeding his female customers to sharks and videotaping it, while also offering little brainy speeches about the nature of makos, mosquitos or sailfish while toying with his prey.",
      "He meets what seems like his match in Hassie Harrison's Zephyr, an American antisocial surf queen who lives in a van and refuses to be tied down. \u201cThere was nothing for me on land,\u201d she says. She's kind of a handful for any serial killer, For instance, she can pick locks with the underwire from a bikini top.",
      "Nick Lepard's screenplay is muscular and satisfying, with nods to \u201cJaws,\u201d of course, but also to \u201cPoint Break,\u201d \u201cHannibal\u201d and even the song \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d He says he was inspired to write \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d by seeing a surfboard bag and imagining it carrying a body, which says something about how Lepard's mind works, though we're not judging.",
      "Director Sean Byrnes has a super ability to build dread and his scenes are crisp without being exploitative. The movie was shot on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast, but may take a bite out of the region's shark cage diving fleets. I'm looking twice even before taking showers now.",
      "Zephyr and the serial killer play an engaging game of chess for most of the movie, if by chess is meant she's fighting to stay alive by wriggling out of handcuffs and running or swimming away and he's determined for her to be shark food.",
      "\u201cOh, you're a fighter. I love fighters. It makes for a better show,\u201d he says, biting into the scenery almost as viciously as the sharks chomp on chum.",
      "He also does that thing that all serial killers do \u2014 saying he and his victim are similar. \u201cYou're hard as nails. Like me. You and me, we're sharks,\u201d he tells her. She tells him to stop talking so much and calls him ocean scum.",
      "The music department has a fun wink with the soundtrack. One scene uses Steve Wright's \u201cEvie (Part One)\u201d \u2014 in which the singer begs his love to let her hair hang down \u2014 as the serial killer makes mementos out of his victims' hair. Another moment, astonishingly, plays Etta James' \u201cAt Last,\u201d the ultimate wedding song, just as the bad guy finally captures his quarry inches from rescue.",
      "The setting of a boat in the middle of the Coral Sea unlocks a delicious new home for terror. Sealable hatches and no one for miles means screaming is no good. And the serial killer has weaponized Vegemite.",
      "One thing Zephyr has up her sleeve is a boy, smitten after a meet-cute in which she tries to shoplift ice cream. He's played by the hunky Josh Heuston and they're perfect for each other but she resists until she's snatched by our nasty boat captain. But even though she blew him off, her boy is suspicious about her disappearance and is on the hunt.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d thankfully, doesn't try to be more than it is, although the quite beautiful images of sharks sliding through the ocean show, naturally, that we are the species that inspired the title. After all, sharks don't see a surfboard bag and wonder if they can put a body in it.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong, bloody violent content, grisly images, sexuality, language and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Three stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Kimberly Belflower knew \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d needed its final cathartic scene to work \u2014 and, for that, it needed Lorde's \u201cGreen Light.\u201d",
      "\u201cI literally told my agent, \u2018I would rather the play just not get done if it can\u2019t use that song,\u2019\u201d the playwright laughed. She wrote Lorde a letter, explaining what the song meant, and got her green light.",
      "Starring Sadie Sink, the staggering play about high schoolers studying \u201cThe Crucible\u201d as the #MeToo movement arrives in their small Georgia town, earned seven Tony nominations, including best new play \u2014 the most of any this season. It\u2019s among a group of Broadway shows that have centered the stories of young people and attracted audiences to match.",
      "Sam Gold\u2019s Brooklyn-rave take on \u201cRomeo + Juliet,\u201d nominated for best revival of a play and led by Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler with music from Jack Antonoff, drew the youngest ticket-buying audience recorded on Broadway, producers reported, with 14% of ticket purchasers aged 18-24, compared to the industry average of 3%.",
      "The shows share some DNA: pop music (specifically the stylings of Antonoff, who also produced \u201cGreen Light\u201d), Hollywood stars with established fanbases and stories that reflect the complexity of young adulthood.",
      "\u201cIt was very clear that young people found our show because it was doing what theater\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d Gold said. \u201cBe a mirror.\u201d",
      "The themes \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d investigates aren't danced around (until they literally are). The girls are quick to discuss #MeToo's impact, intersectional feminism and sexual autonomy. Their conversations, true to teenage girlhood, are laced with comedy and pop culture references \u2014 Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9, \u201cTwilight,\u201d and, of course, Lorde.",
      "Fina Strazza, 19, portrays Beth, a leader who is whip-smart and well-intentioned \u2014 but whose friendships and belief system are shaken by the play's revelations.",
      "\u201cYou have so much empathy and are so invested in her, but she still has these mishaps and slip-ups that young people often have,\u201d said Strazza, nominated for best featured actor in a play. Some audience members have given her letters detailing how Beth helped them forgive themselves for how they handled similar experiences.",
      "The script is written in prose, with frequent line breaks and infrequent capital letters. Director Danya Taymor, nominated for best direction of a play a year after winning a Tony for another teenage canon classic, \u201cThe Outsiders, \u201d was drawn to that rhythm \u2014 and how Belflower's depiction of adolescence captured its intensity, just as S.E. Hinton had.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the teenage years that is so raw,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cNone of us can escape it.\u201d",
      "During his Tony-winning production of \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d Gold found himself having conversations with young actors and theatergoers about climate change, politics and how \u201ctheater was something that people their age and younger really need in a different way, as the world is becoming so addicted to technology,\u201d he said.",
      "That conjured \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The original text \u201chas it all in terms of what it means to inherit the future that people older than you have created,\u201d Gold said.",
      "Building the world of this show, with an ensemble under 30, was not unlike building \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d set in 19th century Norway, Gold said: \u201cI think the difference is that the world that I made for this show is something that a very hungry audience had not gotten to see.\u201d",
      "Fans, Gold correctly predicted, were ravenous. Demand ahead of the first preview prompted a preemptive extension. Word (and bootleg video) of Connor doing a pullup to kiss Zegler made the rounds. \u201cMan of the House,\u201d an Antonoff-produced ballad sung by Zegler mid-show, was released as a single. With the show premiering just before the U.S. presidential election, Voters of Tomorrow even registered new voters in the lobby.",
      "Audiences proved willing to pay: Average ticket prices hovered around $150. Cheaper rush and lottery tickets drew lines hours before the box office opened. Every week but one sold out.",
      "\u201cThe show was initially really well sold because we had a cast that appealed to a really specific audience,\u201d said producer Greg Nobile of Seaview Productions. \u201cWe continued to see the houses sell out because these audiences came, and they were all over online talking about the ways in which they actually felt seen.\u201d",
      "Thomas Laub, 28, and Alyah Chanelle Scott, 27, started Runyonland Productions for that very reason.",
      "\u201cWe both felt a lot of frustration with the industry, and the ways that we were boxed out of it as students in Michigan who were able to come to New York sparingly,\u201d Laub said. Runyonland was launched in 2018 with the premise that highlighting new, bold voices would bring change.",
      "This spring, Scott, known for playing Whitney in HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d acted off-Broadway in Natalie Margolin's \u201cAll Nighter.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was standing onstage and looking out and seeing the college kids that I was playing,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I respect you so much. I want to do you proud. I want to show you a story that represents you in a way that doesn\u2019t belittle or demean you, but uplifts you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Co-producing \u201cJohn Proctor,\u201d Scott said, gave Runyonland the opportunity to target that audience on a Broadway scale. Belflower developed the show with students as part of a The Farm College Collaboration Project. It's been licensed over 100 times for high school and college productions. The Broadway production's social and influencer marketing is run by 20-somethings, too.",
      "Previews attracted fans with a $29 ticket lottery. While average prices jumped to over $100 last week (still below the Broadway-wide average), $40 rush, lottery and standing room tickets have sold out most nights, pushing capacity over 100%. The success is validating Runyonland's mission, Laub said.",
      "\u201cAlyah doesn\u2019t believe me that I cry every time at the end,\u201d Laub said. Scott laughs. \u201cI just want to assure you, on the record, that I do indeed cry every time.\u201d",
      "The final scene of \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d is a reclamation fueled by rage and \u201cGreen Light.\u201d Capturing that electricity has been key to the show's marketing.",
      "\u201cThe pullup (in \u2018Romeo + Juliet\u2019) is so impactful because it's so real. It's like so exactly what a teenage boy would do,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cI think when you see the girls in \u2018John Proctor\u2019 screaming ... it hits you in a visceral way.\u201d That screaming made the Playbill cover.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, the look and feel of that campaign feels different from a traditional theatrical campaign, and it feels a lot closer to a film campaign,\u201d Laub said. The show's team indeed considered the zeitgeist-infiltrating work of their sister industries, specifically studios like Neon and A24.",
      "In May, \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d finished its second \u201cspirit week\u201d with a school spirit day. Earlier events included an ice cream social \u2014 actors served Van Leeuwen \u2014 a silent disco and a banned book giveaway. For those not in their own school's colors, the merch stand offered T-shirts, including one printed with the Walt Whitman-channeling line said by Sink's Shelby: \u201cI contain frickin' multitudes.\u201d",
      "Julia Lawrence, 26, designed the shirt after the show's team saw her TikTok video reimagining their traditional merch into something more like a concert tee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so incredible to bring Gen Z into the theater that way, especially at a time when theater has never been more important,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIn a world that\u2019s overpowered by screens, live art can be such a powerful way to find understanding.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn \u2018The Life of Chuck,\u2019 we understand that this guy\u2019s life is cut short, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t experience joy,\u201d says King. \u201cExistential dread and grief and things are part of the human experience, but so is joy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s telling that when King, our preeminent purveyor of horror, writes about doom times, he ends up scaling it down to a single life. While darkness and doom have, and probably always will, mark his work, King \u2014 a more playful, instinctual, genre-skipping writer than he\u2019s often credited as \u2014 \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d is a prime example of King, the humanist.",
      "\u201cAn awful lot of people assume, because he writes so much stuff that\u2019s so scary, they kind of forget the reason his horror works so well is he\u2019s always juxtaposing it with light and with love and with empathy,\u201d says Flanagan, who has twice before adapted King (\u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d) and is in the midst of making a \u201cCarrie\u201d series for Amazon.",
      "\u201cYou forget that \u2018It\u2019 isn\u2019t about the clown, it\u2019s about the kids and their friendship,\" adds Flanagan. \u201c\u2018The Stand\u2019 isn\u2019t about the virus or the demon taking over the world, it\u2019s ordinary people who have to come together and stand against a force they cannot defeat.\u201d",
      "King, 77, has now written somewhere around 80 books, including the just released \u201cNever Flinch.\u201d The mystery thriller brings back King\u2019s recent favorite protagonist, the private investigator Holly Gibney, who made her stand-alone debut in \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d It\u2019s Gibney\u2019s insecurities, and her willingness to push against them, that has kept King returning to her.",
      "\u201cIt gave me great pleasure to see Holly grow into a more confident person,\u201d King says. \u201cShe never outgrows all of her insecurities, though. None of us do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever Flinch\u201d is a reminder that King has always been less of a genre-first writer than a character-first one. He tends to fall in love with a character and follow them through thick and thin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always happy writing. That\u2019s why I do it so much,\u201d King says, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m a very chipper guy because I get rid of all that dark stuff in the books.\u201d",
      "Dark stuff, as King says, hasn\u2019t been hard to come by lately, he grants. The kind of climate change disaster found in \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d King says, often dominates his anxieties.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re creeping up little by little on being the one country who does not acknowledge it\u2019s a real problem with carbon in the atmosphere,\u201d King says. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Certain right wing politicians can talk all they want about how we\u2019re saving the world for our grandchildren. They don\u2019t care about that. They care about money.\u201d",
      "On social media, King has been a sometimes critic of President Donald Trump, whose second term has included battles with the arts, academia and public financing for PBS and NPR. Over the next four years, King predicts, \u201cCulture is going to go underground.\u201d",
      "In \u201cNever Finch,\u201d Holly Gibney is hired as a bodyguard by a women\u2019s rights activist whose lecture tour is being plagued by mysterious acts of violence. In the afterward of the book, King includes a tribute to \u201csupporters of women\u2019s right to choose who have been murdered for doing their duty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to like that,\u201d King says of right-wing critics.",
      "The original germ for \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d had nothing to do with current events. One day in Boston, King noticed a drummer busking on Boylston Street. He had the vision of a businessman in a suit who, walking by, can\u2019t resist dancing with abandon to the drummer\u2019s beat.",
      "King, a self-acknowledged dancer (though only in private, he notes), latched onto a story that would turn on the unpredictable nature of people, tracing the inner life of that imagined passerby. In the film, he\u2019s played by Tom Hiddleston. Chuck first appears, oddly, on a billboard that haunts and confuses a local teacher (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who's struggling to get his students to care about literature or education with the possible end of the world encroaching.",
      "It\u2019s a funny but maybe not coincidental irony that many of the best King adaptations, like \u201cStand By Me\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\" have come from the author\u2019s more warm-hearted tales. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which won the People\u2019s Choice Award last fall at the Toronto International Film Festival, is after a similar spirit.",
      "When King reached out about attending the TIFF world premiere, Flanagan was shocked. The last time King had done that for one of his own adaptations was 26 years ago, for \u201cThe Green Mile.\u201d That movie, like \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d were box-office disappointments, King recalls, a fate he's hoping \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d can avoid.",
      "\u201cHe views this movie as something that\u2019s a bit precious,\u201d says Flanagan. \u201cHe\u2019s said a few things to me in the past about how earnest it is, how this is a story without an ounce of cynicism. As it was being released into a cynical world, I think he felt protective of it. I think this one really means something to him.\u201d",
      "The Stephen King industrial complex, meanwhile, keeps rolling along. Coming just this year are series of \u201cWelcome to Derry\u201d and \u201cThe Institute\u201d and a film of \u201cThe Long Walk.\u201d King, himself, just finished a draft of \u201cTalisman 3.\u201d",
      "If \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d has particular meaning to King, it could be because it represents something intrinsic about his own life. Chuck's small, seemingly unremarkable existence has grace and meaning because, as Whitman is quoted, he \"contains multitudes\u201d that surprise and delight him. King's fiction is evidence \u2014 heaps of it \u2014 that he does, too.",
      "\u201cThere are some days where I sit down and I think, \u2018This is going to be a really good day,\u2019 and it\u2019s not, at all,\u201d says King. \u201cThen other days I sit down and think to myself, \u2018I\u2019m really tired and don\u2019t feel like doing this,\u2019 and then it catches fire. You never know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d",

      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Cynthia Erivo will release her sophomore solo album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- It began as it always should, with her voice.",
      "The second solo album from Cynthia Erivo, fresh off a herculean press run with the success of the first \u201cWicked\u201d film, was always meant to be \u201cvocal-focused,\u201d she told The Associated Press recently. It may be the understatement of a lifetime: to know her is to know her instrument \u2014 that range, the notes few else can hit but many attempt.",
      "And Erivo's new soulful album, the evocatively titled \u201cI Forgive You,\" hits the mark.",
      "In the studio, that meant using her vocals \u201cas the pads, as the stacking,\u201d like an artist might with a guitar or piano. \u201cThe meat of each of the pieces that you listen to is the voice,\u201d she says, \u201cSo that you can hear the lyrics, you can hear the song, you can hear the emotion in it,\u201d she explains. The other instruments, too, were performed live. \"Everything you hear in there is real and tangible.\u201d",
      "For that reason \u2014 and other expressions of autonomy take across the album \u2014 she says it felt like her first. For the listener, it evokes a real feeling of intimacy.",
      "Erivo spoke to the AP about \u201cI Forgive You,\u201d life after \u201cWicked\" and the forthcoming \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d and the ways in which acting, singing and writing inform one another.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "ERIVO: This album is a collection of stories and songs that are both personal for things that are happening now, things that have happened in the past, and I think some of which I have had to forgive people for. And honestly, some of which I\u2019ve had to forgive myself for. And I loved the idea of calling it this title, because it\u2019s a simple concept, but not an easy one. And not one that we as humans are very good at, often.",
      "A part of me was feeling, like, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if people had to keep repeating the words, 'I forgive you?'\u201d So even if you\u2019re finding it difficult to say this album will give you the permission to actually say the words, even if you\u2019re not quite ready.",
      "ERIVO: The concept of being a work in progress \u2014 who still gets scared of things, who still has to deal with things \u2014 that won\u2019t ever necessarily stop. It might get quiet, but that feeling doesn\u2019t necessarily always go away. I just wanted to be honest, and I think that \u201cReplay\u201d was probably the first song that I put out was because I felt like it was sort of a reintroduction to the inner part of me that most people might not really know.",
      "But it\u2019s also a tricky song in that it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s kind of upbeat, and if you actually listen, you hear that there\u2019s like a person who\u2019s a little bit fragile, a person whose trying to figure some things out, a person who\u2019s been through some things, who\u2019s dealt with things, who has abandonment issues, who has fear, who an inferiority complex sometimes, who wants to help everyone, who wants to save everyone, but gets it wrong.",
      "Those are human, human things that I want to share.",
      "ERIVO: No apprehension about writing it, a little apprehension about sharing it, because it\u2019s honest. But once it\u2019s done, what can you do? It\u2019s time to share.",
      "ERIVO: They feed each other. When I sing, I feel free and I feel open, which means that when I go and act \u2014 because I\u2019ve given myself that experience \u2014 the want to close off again sort of goes away. So, when I\u2019m on a set, I\u2019m as open as I am when I am singing. I\u2019m waiting to receive whatever I\u2019m getting from my counterpart or whoever\u2019s opposite me so I can actually listen. Because the act of writing and singing actually is also the act of listening.",
      "ERIVO: I had a sort of level of anonymity that I think I got used to and I really kind of enjoyed. That isn\u2019t necessarily there anymore, which is still really lovely because people are kind and sweet, and I\u2019m really grateful for it. But that\u2019s an adjustment, to realize that you can\u2019t just walk into a store and no one will know who you are, or you can\u2019t get on a plane, and no one will there you are. That\u2019s a new thing that I didn\u2019t expect or wasn't seeking.",
      "ERIVO: We have a couple pickups and then we\u2019re done.",
      "ERIVO: I\u2019m so proud of it. We spent a lot of time on it. We worked really, really hard on it. There was no stone unturned on it because I love what I do, and I love music, and I loved making it.",
      "So just know that this was made with a lot of love.",

      "Getting to call a Stanley Cup Final for the third time on national television would qualify as the top moment of the year for most announcers",
      "Getting to call a Stanley Cup Final for the third time on national television would qualify as the top moment of the year for most announcers.",
      "For TNT's Kenny Albert, it is another accomplishment in a year that has been filled with many, especially over the past nine months.",
      "Wednesday's Game 1 between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers will be Albert's 1,483rd call in hockey, football or baseball for a national network. He moved past his father, the legendary Marv Albert, into fourth place among North American announcers during last Wednesday's Game 5 of the Eastern Conference final between Florida and Carolina.",
      "\u201cTo be listed along with some of the all-time greats who I watched growing up and then got to know a lot of them personally, it\u2019s a proud moment when you see that you\u2019re included in that group,\u201d Albert said. \u201cMy schedule definitely is a bit of a jigsaw puzzle between the various sports and networks, but very fortunate to work for and with so many great people.\u201d",
      "Albert surpassed the 500 games mark in both the NFL and NHL within a six-month period.",
      "He became the first NFL play-by-play announcer to reach 500 games on one network last October when the Philadelphia Eagles hosted the Cleveland Browns in a game televised by Fox. He has been with Fox Sports since its beginning in 1994.",
      "He surpassed 500 national NHL games on Dec. 18 when the Philadelphia Flyers faced the Detroit Red Wings on TNT. Albert has been TNT's top hockey announcer since it got the rights in 2021.",
      "All told, Albert has done 534 NHL, 512 NFL, 421 baseball and 15 NBA games on a national broadcast or cable network. That is on top of his other duties as New York Rangers radio voice and backup for New York Knicks television games on MSG Network.",
      "Albert's versatility to do a plethora of different sports was something he picked up from his father. Even though Marv Albert's signature sport was the NBA, he also did the NFL and NHL along with hosting the baseball pregame show during the late 1980s on NBC.",
      "\u201cI've always loved the variety,\u201d Kenny Albert said.",
      "For all of the aforementioned accomplishments, though, the highlight of Albert's year so far was calling Alex Ovechkin's 895th NHL goal on April 6 to break Wayne Gretzky's career record. Albert's call during the second period, when the Washington Capitals star set the record against the New York Islanders, relayed excitement while also mentioning the goal number and then going silent so that the crowd and scenes from the crowd could take over.",
      "\u201cIn a championship situation or big moment, I don't usually write something out, but I do throw some words around in my mind just to be ready,\u201d Albert said. \"I was thinking something with his nickname, the Great Eight, the great Gretzky. When he tied the record, Joe Beninati (the Capitals TV announcer) used something similar to that, so I wanted to shift over to something else and not use some of the same words he did.",
      "\u201cWhen it happened, it just came out naturally. I mentioned No. 895 and then I just got out of the way. It was very important after the call to just lay out and let the production folks do their thing. Let the pictures and sound tell the story.\u201d",
      "According to TV database research compiled by Un/Necessary Sports Research, the late Bob Cole, who called the games for CBC\u2019s \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d for 50 years, leads the way at 1,722 (all hockey) games; followed by Dick Stockton, who did basketball, baseball and football for CBS and Fox, with 1,544; and Canadian play-by-play announcer Chris Cuthbert with 1,539. Cuthbert, the current lead voice for \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d will surpass Stockton if the Stanley Cup Final goes six games.",
      "Kevin Harlan is sixth at 1,477 and should surpass Marv Albert (1,481) for fifth during Week 5 of the upcoming NFL season.",
      "This will be the 11th Stanley Cup Final for Albert, including eight on radio, but the first where he has called a rematch from the previous year. This is the first final rematch since the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009 and the second over the past 40 years.",
      "\u201cIt has a chance to be one of the all-time great championship series,\" Albert said. \"These same teams played a scintillating seven-game series last June. Star power on both sides. Edmonton attempting to win Canada\u2019s first Cup since 1993. Florida looking to repeat. Can Connor McDavid match Wayne Gretzky and Sidney Crosby and win his first Stanley Cup against the team that beat his club in the Cup Final the year before? I can\u2019t wait.\u201d",

      "British writer Bernardine Evaristo has won the Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature.\u201d",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Bernardine Evaristo doesn't like boundaries.",
      "For the Booker Prize -winning novelist, rules about genre, grammar or what a working-class biracial woman can achieve are all to be challenged and swept away.",
      "Evaristo was announced Wednesday as recipient of the 100,000-pound ($135,000) Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature and her unwavering dedication to uplifting under-represented voices.\"",
      "Evaristo, 66, received the prize both for her work to help promote women and writers of color, and for writing that takes in poetry, a memoir and seven novels including the Booker-winning \u201cGirl, Woman, Other.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just go wherever my imagination takes me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write the kind of novels that would take you on a predictable emotional or moral journey.\u201d",
      "Evaristo had already explored autobiographical fiction, historical settings and alternate realities when she won the Booker in 2019 for \u201cGirl Woman, Other,\u201d a polyphonic novel told from the point of view of a dozen characters, largely Black women, with widely varying ages, experiences and sexualities.",
      "She was the first woman of African heritage to be awarded the prize, which was founded in 1969 and has a reputation for transforming writers\u2019 careers.",
      "When she won, Evaristo was 60 and had been a writer for decades. She says the recognition \u201ccame at the right time for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t have handled it so well if I was younger,\u201d she told The Associated Press at her London home. \u201cIt changed my career \u2013- in terms of book sales, foreign rights, translation, the way in which I was viewed as a writer. Various other opportunities came my way. And I felt that I had the foundations to handle that.\u201d",
      "Evaristo\u2019s house on a quiet suburban street is bright and comfortable, with wooden floors, vibrant textiles and a large wooden writing desk by the front window. Large photos of her Nigerian paternal grandparents hang on one wall. Her work often draws on her roots as the London-born child of a Nigerian father and white British mother.",
      "Like much of Evaristo\u2019s work, \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d eludes classification. She calls it \u201cfusion fiction\u201d for its melding of poetry and prose into a novel that relishes the texture and rhythm of language.",
      "\u201cI kind of dispense with the rules of grammar,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I have 12 full stops in the novel.\u201d",
      "If that sounds dauntingly experimental, readers didn\u2019t think so. \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d has sold more than 1 million copies and was chosen as one of Barack Obama\u2019s books of the year.",
      "Evaristo traces her love of poetry to the church services of her Catholic childhood, where she soaked up the rhythms of the Bible and sermons, \u201cwithout realizing I was absorbing poetry.\u201d",
      "When she started writing novels, the love of poetry remained, along with a desire to tell stories of the African diaspora. One of her first major successes, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Babe,\u201d is a verse novel set in Roman Britain.",
      "\u201cMost people think the Black history of Britain only began in the 20th century,\u201d Evaristo said. \u201cI wanted to write about a Black presence in Roman Britain -\u2013 because there was a Black presence in Roman Britain 1,800 years ago.\u201d",
      "Another novel, \u201cBlonde Roots,\u201d is set in an alternative historical timeline in which Africans have enslaved Europeans, and was nominated for a major science-fiction award.",
      "\u201cMr Loverman,\u201d which centers on a closeted gay 70-something Antiguan Londoner, was an attempt to move beyond cliched images of Britain\u2019s postwar Caribbean immigrants. It was recently made into a BBC television series starring Lennie James and Sharon D. Clarke.",
      "Her latest award is a one-off accolade marking the 30th anniversary of the annual Women\u2019s Prizes for English-language fiction and nonfiction.",
      "Women\u2019s Prize founder Kate Mosse said Evaristo\u2019s \u201cdazzling skill and imagination, and her courage to take risks and offer readers a pathway into diverse and multifarious worlds over a 40-year career made her the ideal recipient.\u201d",
      "Evaristo, who teaches creative writing at Brunel University of London, plans to use the prize money to help other women writers through an as-yet undisclosed project.",
      "She has long been involved with projects to level the playing field for under-represented writers, and is especially proud of Complete Works, a mentoring program for poets of color that she ran for a decade.",
      "\u201cI set that up because I initiated research into how many poets of color were getting published in Britain at that time, and it was under 1%\u201d of the total, she said. A decade later, it was 10%.",
      "\"It really has helped shift the poetry landscape in the U.K.,\" she said.",
      "Evaristo followed \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d with \u201cManifesto,\u201d a memoir that recounts the stark racism of her 1960s London childhood, as well as her lifelong battle for creative expression and freedom.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge sentenced disbarred celebrity lawyer Tom Girardi to seven years and three months in prison on Tuesday for embezzling tens of millions of dollars from his clients, including several with severe physical injuries and families of people killed in accidents.",
      "U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton also ordered Girardi, 86, to pay a $35,000 fine and $2.3 million in restitution to former clients. A jury in August found him guilty of four counts of wire fraud, and he could have been sentenced to up to 80 years in prison.",
      "Girardi is the estranged husband of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Erika Jayne and appeared on the show himself dozens of times between 2015 and 2020.",
      "He was once among the most prominent lawyers in the nation, often representing victims of major disasters against powerful companies. One lawsuit against California\u2019s Pacific Gas and Electric utility led to a $333 million settlement and was portrayed in the 2000 Julia Roberts film \u201cErin Brockovich.\u201d",
      "But his law empire collapsed, and he was disbarred in California in 2022 over client thefts.",
      "Girardi has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and issues with his memory led another court to put him in a conservatorship under his brother. But on Monday, Staton ruled that he was mentally competent to be sentenced, just as she had previously found him mentally competent to stand trial.",
      "The judge had allowed him to remain free until his sentencing but ordered him to surrender to authorities by July 17.",
      "An email to Girardi\u2019s attorney seeking comment on the conviction was not immediately answered.",
      "Former clients who testified against Girardi at his trial included an Arizona woman whose husband was killed in a boat accident and victims who were burned in a 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, south of San Francisco.",
      "Prosecutors played jurors voicemails in which Girardi gave a litany of false reasons money that a court had awarded could not be paid, including tax and debt obligations and judge authorizations. He frequently told them, \u201cDon't be mad at me.\u201d",

      "If there's one story that shows who Young is, it would be from the day of the Met Gala, which she and cast members of \u201cPurpose\u201d were invited, along with its playwright. That same day, Jacobs-Jenkins won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.",
      "Young found out while getting her makeup done and began screaming.

The earliest contributors and up to two guests each will spend June 27-29 touring MrBeast\u2019s North Carolina studio, hearing from the production team in a private Q&A and visiting Beast Philanthropy\u2019s food pantry.",

      "The content has drawn a mix of praise from fans for working with local nonprofits to support previously unfunded projects and pushback from critics who accused Donaldson of exploiting vulnerable people for clickbait \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d Campaigns have involved treating rheumatic heart disease in Nigeria and protecting endangered animals in Kenya. Other examples include building wells in countries across Africa and covering the cost of cataract surgery for 1,000 people.",
      "The call also signals Donaldson\u2019s continued philanthropic presence after comments suggesting he would get \u201cless hate\u201d if he stepped away from philanthropy altogether. Responding to allegations that he uses philanthropy as a shield, Donaldson said he thinks \u201cit paints a negative spotlight on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople hate me more because I do good,\u201d Donaldson said in a conversation uploaded last November on the YouTube channel oompaville. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s too crazy of a statement. I\u2019m not trying to sound like a victim here or anything.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe truth is, I just find videos where I help people more fun than videos where I don\u2019t,\u201d he added.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcement comes shortly after Amazon Prime Video renewed Beast Games for two more seasons. The reality competition series pitted 1,000 contestants against each other for a $5 million grand prize that doubled in the Feb. 13 finale.

      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\u201d said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\u201d planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show, narrated by actor Pedro Pascal, features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker \u2014 including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\u201cYou just never know what you're going to find,\u201d Emmart said.",

      "When he was first asked to lead the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number",
      "NEW YORK -- When he was first asked to helm the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number. It was just too delicious.",
      "\u201cWhen they sent it to me, I was cooking and I burnt dinner because my mind was spinning,\" he says. \"I was, like, \u2018This is a gift. I will never get an opening number like this again.\u2019\u201d",
      "So Gattelli worked out everything else about how to put Robert Zemeckis\u2019 1992 comic cult classic onto a stage and only then turned to the big, brassy song, \u201cFor the Gaze,\u201d a winking valentine to gay men, punning along the way.",
      "\u201cI was able to do the show and then have my full brain on that number because I knew the potential of what it could be,\u201d he says.",
      "What Gattelli crafted is an opening number for the ages, led by Megan Hilty: There are mid-song costume changes, dance breaks, chorus boys hoisting Hilty, spangly jumpsuits and tuxedos, high-kicking Vegas showgirls with feather headdresses, a body double doing somersaults, a rainbow flag of top-hatted dancers, and Hilty doing a Liza Minnelli cameo, all ending with the grand finale of Hilty as Judy Garland's Dorothy from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d complete with a little stuffed dog.",
      "\u201cI heard the pocket in that song, and I was like, \u2018I know there\u2019s a giant laugh there. I can hear giant laughs, what\u2019s that giant laugh?'\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest gay reference? Then I literally I just worked backwards.\u201d",
      "That number telegraphs to the audience exactly what to expect for the rest of the night \u2014 a perfectly rehearsed, lushly costumed, silly, self-aware comedy.",
      "\u201cOnce we hit \u2018For the Gaze,\u2019 the audience knows exactly what the show is,\" he says. \"And then I think they\u2019re in for the ride.\u201d",
      "The work on \u201cFor the Gaze\u201d has helped Gattelli see his show earn 10 Tony Award nominations, including one for his Broadway debut as a director and another for his choreography.",
      "The musical is based on the film, which starred Meryl Streep as a self-centered actor and Goldie Hawn as her suffering-in-the-shadows writer friend. Their mutual desperate measures for achieving eternal youth turn comically grotesque. Hilty plays the Streep role, while Jennifer Simard plays the Hawn one.",
      "\u201cIt felt like just the perfect fit for what I do and what I love to do,\" Gattelli says. \"I love comedy and I love to direct comedy and I love to do these big splashy numbers. It felt like everything I\u2019ve been itching to do.\u201d",
      "Gattelli \u2014 who was a dancer in the original \u201cCats\u201d \u2014 has been a mainstay on Broadway of late, able to choreograph such venerable works as \u201cThe King and I\u201d and \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d but also irreverent musicals as \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d and the jukebox variety, like \u201cThe Cher Show.\u201d",
      "He made his directing debut off-Broadway in 2011 with \u201cSilence!\u201d a parody musical of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d complete with a chorus of dancing lambs running across the stage.",
      "Lowe Cunningham, lead producer of \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d saw it in Los Angeles and later asked Gattelli about the experience, how he collaborated and his approach to the work. She was impressed by his openness to all ideas and his caring.",
      "\u201cI think first and foremost, his talent is clear and it\u2019s been out there in the world of choreography for a long time. He is innovative, he does things other people aren\u2019t doing, but the other thing is that he\u2019s renowned as being an incredibly kind human being,\u201d she says.",
      "Gattelli, who won a 2012 Tony for choreographing \u201cNewsies the Musical\u201d \u2014 one of his show-stopping moments was dancers sliding on newspapers \u2014 was brought in relatively late to \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d only a year and half before opening on Broadway.",
      "\u201cIt was a great lesson in trusting your instincts,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said, \u2018We want a lush, opulent, sexy, magical sparkling evening.\u2019 And we just started taking big swings.\u201d",
      "It started with \u2014 of all things \u2014 the curtain. The audience filing into the theater is greeted by a purple, royal fabric. \u201cWhen people walk in, they immediately feel like that it\u2019s lush and sexy and mysterious.\u201d",
      "The musical is filled with very funny special effects that are decidedly low-tech. At one point, the two leading ladies are replaced by two men duking it out in dresses and wigs. The audience roars at the deception and Gattelli even advised one of the male combatants not to shave his arm hair.",
      "\u201cThe audience is in on the joke,\u201d he says. \u201cI love that they go on that ride with us. They\u2019re laughing with us. We\u2019re all laughing together and it feels good.\u201d",
      "One scene from the movie needed a lot of planning to make it on stage: The tumble down the elegant mansion stairs by Hilty's character. Hollywood CGI magic would have to be replicated by Broadway ingenuity.",
      "\u201cThe people that know the movie and the fans especially are going to go, \u2018How are they going to do it?\u2019 It was keeping me up at night forever because we tried everything,\u201d says Gattelli.",
      "The creative team \u2014 which also included set designer Derek McLane, lighting designer Justin Townsend and sound designer Peter Hylenski \u2014 decided to make it a dance punctuated by sound effects.",
      "Warren Yang \u2014 an actor with a gymnastics background \u2014 wears Hilty's outfit and a wig as he tumbles slowly, acrobatically and theatrically down the stairs, somersaulting as thunder sounds crash and we hear what seems like bones cracking. (The stairs were made of the rubber Neoprene for safety.)",
      "\u201cThere are very simple techniques that make a big impact,\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cI just went back to it\u2019s a beautiful, lush, gorgeous show, but, at the core, it\u2019s just theatrical magic and stagecraft.\u201d",

      "Canada\u2019s wildfire season is off to an intense start",
      "While images of wildfires capture their ferocity, data can provide insight into how bad a fire season is.",
      "Such is the case with two graphics, powered by satellite data, that showcase a Canadian wildfire season off to a wild \u2014 and scary \u2014 start.",
      "Twice a day a NASA satellite sends images to the ground, giving a real-time view of where fires are burning. This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed.",
      "As of Tuesday that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That\u2019s more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch.",
      "Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.",
      "Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.",
      "Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles \u2014 more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.",
      "Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.",
      "\u201cA warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\u201d said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.",
      "The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread.",
      "\u201cClimate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\u201d MacCarthy said. \u201cIt might be a human starting it, but it\u2019s going to spread quickly because now there\u2019s hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\u201d",
      "The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency\u2019s forecasts also call for \u201ca warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\u201d Buchart said.",
      "\u201cThe remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\u201d he said.",

      "A Johns Hopkins University study, published in JAMA this week, illustrates where more vulnerable communities are located. The results mirror trends established at state and national levels: Routine childhood vaccination rates are dropping.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the state level or national level ... you really don\u2019t see those drastic drops. Those are there. They\u2019re real and they\u2019re really problematic,\u201d said Lauren Gardner, an expert in infectious disease modeling at Johns Hopkins University who is the paper\u2019s senior author. Gardner also built the university\u2019s COVID-19 database.",

Three people have died from measles during this year's outbreaks, and 2025 is inching closer to becoming the worst for measles in more than three decades.",
      "Measles was eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, and the vaccine is safe and highly effective. Public schools nationwide require two doses of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine before kindergarten, but the number of children with non-medical exemptions from those requirements hit an all-time high in the 2023-2024 school year. Health experts say community-level vaccination needs to be at 95% or higher to prevent outbreaks.",
      "The Johns Hopkins study looked at 2,066 counties across 33 states, comparing kindergarten vaccination rates averaged over school years from 2017-2020 to averages from 2022-2024. Where kindergarten data wasn\u2019t available, the researchers used a comparable rate.",
      "Here's what it looks like in counties where there have been outbreaks this year, including in Texas counties that are the epicenter of measles.",
      "Texas has logged 742 measles cases since late January, most in West Texas.",
      "Gaines County has 411 cases, the most in the state. Almost 2% of its population got measles. While the county saw a two percentage-point increase in vaccination rates after the pandemic, its 82.4% rate remains below herd immunity.",
      "Terry County (60 cases) and Yoakum County (20 cases) dropped below the 95% threshold for herd immunity after the pandemic, to 93.7% and 91.8% respectively.",
      "Lubbock County \u2014 which has seen 53 cases and is the closest metro area to Gaines County \u2014 was just below 95% before the pandemic, but dropped three percentage points after to 91.8%.",
      "El Paso County on the border of Mexico has had the third-most measles cases in Texas this year with 57. Its vaccination rate is higher than 95% but saw a 2.1 percentage-point decline to 96.5%.",
      "Counties with outbreaks in Kansas include Gray with 25 cases, Haskell with 11 and and Stevens with seven.",
      "Vaccination rates in Gray County dropped 23 percentage points after the pandemic, from 94% to 71%.",
      "Haskell County dropped 18 percentage points to 65%. And Stevens County dropped 0.5 percentage points to 90.5%.",
      "Colorado's outbreak, which is linked to an international flight that landed at the Denver airport in mid-May, involves six cases: five in state residents and one out-of-state traveler.",
      "Two people who got measles live in Arapahoe County in the Denver metro, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.5 percentage points to 88.4%. Three others live in El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.8 percentage points to 80% post-pandemic.",
      "Pre-pandemic data in North Dakota wasn't available to Johns Hopkins researchers, but they looked at rates from school years ending in 2022, 2023 and 2024.",
      "North Dakota's first outbreak started in Williams County, which now has 16 measles cases. In the timeframe researchers looked at, vaccination rates in Williams rose from 84.6% in 2022 to 87.7% in 2023, only to drop back to 83.5% in 2024.",

      "It might start when you realize you can\u2019t hear the doorbell, or certain ringtones",
      "NEW YORK -- My first tip-off were the little things, the high-pitched little things: the doorbell and ringtones my kids could hear but I could not.",
      "Then it was the garbled-sounding conversations, and the accompanying annoyance of having to ask people to repeat themselves. Or worse, giving up and just playing along without being able to follow everything that was being said.",
      "Even then, I stalled for years before finally going through the process of getting a hearing aid. How do you even begin? Will it look clunky and make me feel like a dinosaur? And the cost!",
      "Getting a hearing test, and confirmation that I needed a hearing aid, was just the beginning.",
      "The doctor handed me a list of places I could go to get fitted. I made some calls and narrowed it down to the places that took my insurance and my zero-interest health care credit card.",
      "The first couple places were demoralizing: I walked in, was told it\u2019d be $7,000 for the \u201cbest\u201d option (they mysteriously didn\u2019t happen to have any other options handy), then marched right back out the door, utterly discouraged.",
      "I started asking friends and neighbors whether they wore a hearing aid, or knew anyone at all with a hearing aid, and could point me to a good audiologist.",
      "It took a lot of poking around, but I found one \u2014 and it made all the difference.",
      "I\u2019ve been wearing my hearing aids for several months now, and they are as easy as slipping on a pair of glasses, are almost invisible, have reconnected me with the world, and, as crazy as this may sound, they bring me joy.",
      "After talking with a few audiologists around the country, it turns out that my experience is pretty typical.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who stall before getting one,\u201d says Meagan P. Bachmann, director of audiology at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cHearing is important because it connects us with people,\u201d she says. \u201cMultiple studies show that not hearing can affect your ability to connect with others and participate in life, so you have to think of it in terms of overall health. Maybe you no longer go to family events, or you don\u2019t understand your doctor. People start to withdraw. A lot of people come in because it\u2019s gotten so bad that it is impacting their relationships.\u201d",
      "To speed up the process and make it less frustrating, here\u2019s what the pros recommend:",
      "1. Get tested, take the results seriously, and know that many if not most hearing aids these days are small, nearly invisible, rechargeable, and pretty easy to wear and maintain. And believe it or not, hearing aids can be fun \u2014 these days, there are colors to choose from and ways to bejewel them. One company, Deafmetal, makes jazzy-looking \u201csafety rings\u201d to help keep hearing aids in place.",
      "2. Shop for an expert audiologist. Look for someone who takes your insurance or any sort of medical credit card you might have, or has a payment plan of some kind, if needed. This is a world at the awkward juncture of consumerism and medical care, but a good audiologist should come across as a medical provider, not a salesperson. And a good audiologist should take the time to work with you to find a hearing aid that meets your individual needs, and also fits your budget.",
      "A good place to start is often with your doctor; with the American Academy of Audiologists, which lists providers on its website; or by word of mouth.",
      "\u201cAlthough all hearing aids are amplifiers, not everybody needs the same thing,\u201d says Bachmann. \u201cFitting a hearing aid is an art. It changes the acoustics, and everyone is different. You want someone who listens to your lifestyle needs. Do you have a lot of difficulty with noise? Are you mostly in quiet situations? How much technology do you need, and what kind?\u201d",
      "Greta Stamper, an audiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, agrees. \u201cHearing loss is not a one-time thing. It\u2019s a chronic health condition. It should be a partnership between you and your audiologist,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone asking you what you\u2019re looking for and how it\u2019s going. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured or pushed.\u201d",
      "3. A note on cost. Although hearing aids can be pricey, there are affordable options, and a good audiologist should be able to let you try out options at several price points. Insurance often covers much of the cost, and there are ways to pay for the remaining cost in installments. Also, avoidance has pretty high costs as well, audiologists say, and the longer the wait, the harder it may be to solve the problem with a hearing aid. Although there are cheaper hearing aids at big box stores, Bachmann warns that it\u2019s good to check with your audiologist before taking that route. \u201cSome of those hearing aids are locked, so that you\u2019re not allowed to have them programmed by an outside audiologist,\u201d she says.",
      "Remember, says Stamper, that hearing aids are an investment, and usually last between five and six years.",
      "4. Know your rights. \u201cWe select what is the most likely to be successful, and if it doesn\u2019t work out you come back and do something else,\u201d says Stamper. She said most states mandate a trial period. In some cases, hearing-aid companies also cover the cost of multiple visits to your audiologist while you are getting used to your new hearing aid and get training in how to use and maintain it.",
      "5. Embrace the process, and expect it to take a little time and a few expert tweaks. Audiologists say your brain needs time to adjust to a hearing aid, and that hearing-aid settings should be adjusted little by little as your brain adapts to them.",
      "\u201cA big misconception is that you can just wear them a couple hours a day. Your brain does better with it if you use them most of the day. Your brain needs to adapt to hearing sounds it hasn't heard for a while, and it takes the brain awhile to relearn how to process all those sounds,\u201d says Stamper.",
      "6. Be realistic. \u201cAlthough hearing aids can be enormously beneficial, they may not give you back your normal hearing,\u201d says Stamper. Depending on the situation, there might be limitations to what a hearing aid can do.",
      "\u201cIt might just be lots of improvement in the key areas in which you\u2019re struggling,\u201d said Stamper.",
      "Using hearing aids is a process, the audiologists say, and although it requires some patience, it can be well worth the journey.",

    "story": [
      "A federal investigation has found that a Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law",
      "WASHINGTON -- A Texas hospital that repeatedly sent a woman who was bleeding and in pain home without ending her nonviable, life-threatening pregnancy violated the law, according to a newly released federal investigation.",
      "The government's findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.",
      "But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.",
      "Thurman had hoped the federal government's investigation, which issued a report in April after concluding its inquiry last year, would send a clear message that ectopic pregnancies must be treated by hospitals in Texas, which has one of the nation's strictest abortion bans.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through this,\u201d Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. \u201cI put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.\u201d",
      "Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.",
      "The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.",
      "On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions.",
      "The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.",
      "Emergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.",
      "Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.",
      "CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.",
      "Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d",
      "Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.",
      "But CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.",
      "The agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.",
      "Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still. There\u2019s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren\u2019t ectopic can be deadly.\u201d",

      "The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia\u2019s death row from execution",
      "ATLANTA -- The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia's death row from execution.",
      "Executions in Georgia were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume for a specific group of prisoners. At least one of those conditions, having to do with the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, has not been met, and seeking an execution date for a prisoner covered by the agreement would breach the agreement, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram ruled.",
      "The agreement includes three conditions that had to be met before executions could be set for the affected prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d Once those conditions were met, the state agreed to give three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months' notice for the rest.",
      "The state has argued that the agreement should no longer apply, contending the conditions have been met. But defense attorneys say it's still valid because the vaccine isn't yet available to infants under 6 months old, and visitation at state prisons has not returned to normal.",
      "Ingram's ruling, issued Friday, addressed only the vaccination question. She plans to handle the visitation issue separately.",
      "Ingram wrote that the state's arguments \u201call boil down to an attempt to rewrite the Agreement.\u201d The state is \u201c(u)nhappy with the language it drafted\u201d and wants to change it so that the condition would be satisfied once vaccines are available to \u201cmost members of the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut courts cannot rewrite contracts to relieve a party of their regrets,\u201d she wrote. She ruled that the agreement is \u201cbinding and enforceable,\u201d that the vaccination condition hasn't been met and that seeking an execution warrant before the requirements have been met would breach the agreement.",
      "The state attorney general's office plans to appeal, a spokesperson said Tuesday.",
      "Ingram noted that the Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical trials for infants under 6 months old, and newborns receive other vaccines. That shows it is possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to ultimately be available for that age group, and the state should have foreseen that that could take years, she wrote.",
      "Experts for both sides had testified that it was probable that the COVID-19 vaccine would eventually become available to babies under the age of 6 months, Ingram wrote.",
      "That was before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed U.S. health secretary. Kennedy last week announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website, which had said those groups should get the shots, was revised to say the vaccinations \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "The agreement covers fewer than 10 of the 34 people currently on Georgia's death row.",
      "While Georgia stopped carrying out executions during the pandemic, death penalty cases continued to wind their way through the court system, and as people exhausted their appeals, they became eligible for execution.",
      "A committee of a judicial task force on COVID-19 in early 2021 instructed lawyers for people on death row and the state attorney general\u2019s office to come up with terms under which executions could safely resume. The two sides reached the agreement in April 2021.",
      "The agreement only applied to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while the judicial emergency was in place. The agreement was to remain in effect through Aug. 1, 2022, or one year from the date on which the conditions were met \u2014 whichever was later.",
      "The legal fight arose from a lawsuit filed when officials set a May 2022 execution date for Virgil Delano Presnell Jr. The Federal Defender Program, which represents Presnell, said the state had violated the agreement because the conditions hadn\u2019t all been met.",
      "Based on that argument, a Fulton County Superior Court judge halted the execution less than 24 hours before it was to take place, and the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in December 2022 that the agreement was a binding contract.",
      "People on death row who are not covered by the agreement have since become eligible for execution. One of them, Willie James Pye, was put to death in March 2024.",

    "story": [
      "A judge says the federal Bureau of Prisons must keep providing hormone therapy to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that the bureau's own medical staff has deemed appropriate.",
      "The judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don\u2019t match.",
      "\u201cIn light of the plaintiffs\u2019 largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The bureau doesn\u2019t dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.",
      "The Republican president\u2019s executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren\u2019t spent \u201cfor the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
      "Lamberth\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.",
      "The lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiffs include Alishea Kingdom, a transgender woman who was prescribed hormone therapy injections and approved to receive social accommodations, including women\u2019s undergarments and cosmetics. Kingdom was denied her hormone shot three times after Trump signed his order, but she had it restored roughly a week after she sued. Her access to feminine undergarments hasn\u2019t been restored, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cIn Ms. Kingdom\u2019s case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "Trump\u2019s order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men\u2019s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.",
      "The judge said there's no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new polices could do to transgender inmates.",
      "\u201cThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs\u2019 access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in 1987.",

      "Rylands Garth, based in London, said more than 520 ex-players from rugby union and rugby league joined the lawsuit by Friday last week, which was the deadline for new applicants set by a court ahead of a hearing in July and before the case potentially goes to trial next year.",
      "It takes the total number of players who are part of the lawsuit to approximately 1,100, Rylands Garth said in a statement.",
      "The former players contend, according to Rylands Garth, that \u201crugby governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect them from the impacts of concussive and sub-concussive blows during their playing careers, despite knowing of the risks.\u201d",
      "Claimants are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the English Rugby Football Union and Welsh Rugby Union \u2014 governing bodies in 15-a-side rugby \u2014 and the English Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association \u2014 from 13-a-side rugby league \u2014 for lost earnings, medical bills and care costs associated with their injuries, the firm said.",
      "\u201cRylands Garth is also calling for urgent and substantive reform of the game to better protect the safety of current and future players \u2014 including the creation of an independent brain health ombudsman for the sport,\u201d it said.",
      "Among those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.",
      "\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement issued by World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU, the governing bodies said they \u201care aware of the latest update shared by the claimants\u2019 legal representatives with the final number of claimants.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe now await full details of their diagnosis and the claims being made. Our thoughts are with any former player facing challenges.",
      "\u201cAcross the game, we continue to build on a strong foundation of world-leading initiatives designed to make rugby union as safe as possible.\"",
      "That includes \u201csmart mouthguard technology in the elite game, trials of lower tackle height in the community game, and the continued rollout of brain health services to support former players.\u201d",
      "Rylands Garth said it also represents approximately 130 former soccer players who are taking similar legal action against soccer governing bodies. The next court hearing for the soccer case is due on June 26.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.",
      "The 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.",
      "Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.",
      "Kennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d",
      "His comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.",
      "Some worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.",
      "Ohio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d",
      "While announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.",
      "For Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.",
      "Daniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.",
      "\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d",
      "The Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.",
      "\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d",
      "Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.",
      "Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.",
      "At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.",
      "Lamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.",
      "\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d",
      "Copeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.",
      "Ashley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.",
      "\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "Doctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.",
      "Kennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.",
      "Both he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.",
      "Last week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.",
      "Eileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she'd like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.",
      "For Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago. She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.",
      "\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "A ban on disposable vapes has come into force across the U.K. as the British government aims to stem their illegal use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment",
      "LONDON -- A ban on disposable vapes came into force across the U.K. on Sunday as the British government aims to stem their use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment.",
      "The ban makes it illegal for any retailer \u2014 online or in-store \u2014 to sell vapes, whether they contain nicotine or not. They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.",
      "The crackdown follows the soaring use of disposable vapes in schools and a rising tide of trash as users dispose of the vapes. It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the U.K., rather than being recycled.",
      "A number of countries are seeking to regulate the vape market, which has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Australia outlawed the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year in some of the world\u2019s toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes, while Belgium became the first European Country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year. California has been at the forefront of bringing in new regulations in the U.S.",
      "The U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said usage among young people remained too high, and the ban would \u201cput an end to their alarming rise in school playgrounds and the avalanche of rubbish flooding the nation\u2019s streets.\u201d",
      "Also known as single-use vapes, disposable vapes are non-refillable and unable to be recharged, and are typically thrown away with general waste or just thrown on the street. Even when they are recycled, they need to be taken apart by hand, while their batteries are a fire risk to recycling facilities and can leak harmful chemicals into the environment and potentially harming wildlife.",
      "Businesses were given six months to prepare for the change by selling any existing stock. Rogue traders who continue to sell them risk a fine of 200 ($260) in the first instance, followed by an unlimited fine or jail time for repeat offending.",
      "The U.K. Vaping Industry Association said its members had moved quickly to comply with the June 1 deadline, but warned of \u201cserious unintended consequences\u201d emanating from too much regulation.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that this ban will encourage former smokers who have already transitioned from cigarettes, which kill 220 people every day in the U.K, to return to combustible tobacco or opt for unregulated vapes,\" said its director general, John Dunne.",
      "Separately, the British government is legislating to potentially restrict the packaging, marketing and flavors of e-cigarettes.",

      "ROME -- French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, best known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris, his institute said in a statement.",
      "Both a doctor and a researcher, Baulieu was known around the world for the scientific, medical and social significance of his work on steroid hormones.",
      "\u201cHis research was guided by his attachment to the progress made possible by science, his commitment to women\u2019s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,\u201d the Institut Baulieu said in the statement posted on its website.",
      "Born Etienne Blum in Strasbourg on Dec. 12, 1926, he took the name \u201c\u00c9mile Baulieu\u201d when he joined the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation at the age of 15.",
      "An endocrinologist with a doctorate in medicine completed in 1955 and one in science eight years later, in 1963 Baulieu founded a pioneering research unit working on hormones at INSERM, the French institute for health and medical research. He remained as head of the unit until 1997.",
      "He is best known for his development, in 1982, of RU 486, the so-called \u201cabortion pill\u201d that changed the lives of millions of women throughout the world, offering them the possibility of voluntary medical termination of pregnancy, in physical and psychological safety.",
      "The Institut Baulieu said it was \u201ca non-invasive method, less aggressive and less delayed than surgery,\u201d noting that following his discovery the researcher faced fierce criticism and even threats from opponents of women's abortion rights.",
      "\u201cEven today, access to this method is opposed, banned in some countries, and is currently being challenged in the United States, where it is the most widely used abortion method,\u201d the institute added.",
      "Baulieu\u2019s research into DHEA, a hormone whose secretion and anti-aging activity he had discovered, led him to work on neurosteroids -- or steroids of the nervous system. He also developed an original treatment to combat depression, for which a clinical trial is currently underway in several university hospitals.",
      "In 2008, he founded the Institut Baulieu to understand, prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.",
      "Honored with the grand crosses of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur (legion of honor) and the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (national order of merit), he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1982, which he chaired in 2003 and 2004.",
      "He was a member of the national advisory committee on life sciences and health (1996-2002) and received numerous awards, both in France and abroad.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Baulieu in a post on X, calling him \u201ca beacon of courage\u201d and \u201ca progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew French people have changed the world to such an extent,\u201d he added.",

      "The attorneys filed a motion Friday to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, but did not give a reason for seeking to drop the case. The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.",

      "The lawsuit was challenging Kentucky\u2019s near-total trigger law ban and a separate six-week ban, both of which were passed by Republican legislative majorities. The trigger law took effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",

      "\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.",
      "Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.",
      "The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.",
      "\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d",
      "Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.",
      "Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.",
      "\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.",
      "The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.",
      "The Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.",
      "\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d",
      "What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.",
      "Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d",
      "State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.",
      "Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.",
      "At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.",
      "\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.",
      "A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.",
      "The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.",
      "A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d",
      "HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.",
      "In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.",
      "In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.",
      "The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d",
      "CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.",
      "So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.",
      "She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.",
      "\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.",
      "With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.",
      "But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. ... We were still pretty trim, but we weren\u2019t just, like, bones.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 \u2014 slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.",
      "In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.",
      "The cuts are not over.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC\u2019s budget, enough to cut the agency\u2019s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.",
      "Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.",
      "\u201cWithout the appropriate funding, we can\u2019t properly address these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.\u201d",

      "India Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inaugurated one of the most ambitious and strategic railway projects the nation has ever built",
      "NEW DELHI -- Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday inaugurated one of the most ambitious railway projects ever built in India, which will connect the Kashmir Valley to the vast Indian plains by train for the first time.",
      "Dubbed by government-operated Indian Railways as one of the most challenging tracks in the world, the 272-kilometer (169-mile) line begins in the garrison city of Udhampur in Jammu region and runs through Indian-controlled Kashmir\u2019s main city of Srinagar. The line ends in Baramulla, a town near the highly militarized Line of Control dividing the Himalayan region between India and Pakistan.",
      "The line travels through 36 tunnels and over 943 bridges. The Indian government pegged the total project cost at around $5 billion.",
      "One of the project\u2019s highlights is a 1,315-meter-long (4,314-foot) steel and concrete bridge above the Chenab River connecting two mountains with an arch 359 meters (1,177 feet) above the water. Indian Railways compared the height to the Eiffel Tower in Paris, which stands 330 meters (1,082 feet), and said the bridge is built to last 120 years and endure extreme weather, including wind speeds up to 260 kph (161 mph).",
      "Modi visited the Chenab bridge with tight security, waving an Indian tri-color flag before boarding a test train that passed through picturesque mountains and tunnels to reach an inauguration ceremony for another high-elevation bridge named Anji.",
      "The prime minister also helped launch a pair of new trains called \u201cVande Bharat\u201d that will halve the travel time between Srinagar and the town of Katra in Jammu to about three hours from the usual six to seven hours by road.",
      "Modi travelled to Indian-controlled Kashmir on Friday for the first time since a military conflict between India and Pakistan brought the nuclear-armed rivals to the brink of their third war over the region last month, when the countries fired missiles and drones at each other.",
      "The conflict began with a gun massacre in late April that left 26 people, mostly Hindu tourists, dead in Indian-controlled Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan for supporting the attackers, a charge Islamabad denied.",
      "Addressing a public rally in Katra, Modi lashed out at Pakistan and alleged Islamabad was behind the massacre. He said the attack was primarily aimed at Kashmir\u2019s flourishing tourism industry and meant to fuel communal violence.",
      "\u201cI promise you, I won\u2019t let developmental activities stop in Kashmir,\u201d Modi said, adding that local industries and businesses will get a boost from the new rail connectivity.",
      "The railway project is considered crucial to boosting tourism and bringing development to a region that has been marred by militancy and protests over the years. The line is expected to ease the movement of Indian troops and the public to the disputed region, which is currently connected by flights and mountain roads that are prone to landslides.",
      "India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, a charge Islamabad denies. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict.",

      "In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named \u201cDemosisto\u201d with fellow young activists Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong\u2019s independence who \u201cbegged for interference\u201d by foreign forces.",
      "Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments said the law brought back stability to the city.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea said Friday it had righted a capsized destroyer and moored it at a pier in the northeastern port of Chongjin as it continues to repair the new warship leader Kim Jong Un has described as a significant asset for his nuclear-armed military.",
      "The report by North Korean state media aligned with South Korean military assessments and recent commercial satellite images.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said experts will closely examine the ship\u2019s hull before beginning the next phase of restoration, which will take place at a dry dock at the neighboring port of Rajin and is expected to last seven to 10 days.",
      "Satellite images taken Thursday by Planet Labs PBC analyzed by The Associated Press showed the stricken destroyer upright and floating. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear from the image just how much damage had been done to the vessel, which had been in the water for days after the failed launch. However, the ship did not appear to be noticeably listing, meaning Pyongyang is likely able to send it onward to the other port to inspect the vessel\u2019s electronics.",
      "Jo Chun Ryong, a senior official from the ruling Workers\u2019 Party, told the agency that the \u201cperfect restoration of the destroyer will be completed without fail\u201d before a major party congress in late June, a deadline set by Kim.",
      "Outside experts say it remains unclear how severely the 5,000-ton-class destroyer was damaged during a botched launching ceremony in late May, which triggered a furious response from Kim, who called the failure a \u201ccriminal act caused by absolute carelessness, irresponsibility, and unscientific empiricism.\u201d",
      "North Korean law enforcement authorities have detained at least four officials over the incident, including the vice director of the Workers\u2019 Party\u2019s munitions industry department, according to state media. The North\u2019s main military committee said those responsible would be held accountable for their \u201cunpardonable criminal act.\u201d",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Thursday that the South\u2019s military assesses that the North Koreans righted the ship earlier this week and are likely conducting drainage operations while examining the damage.",
      "\u201cThe nature and duration of the repair process will vary, depending on internal repairs, additional work or whether the incident affected the keel,\u201d Lee said, referring to the ship\u2019s structural backbone. \u201cThis could also affect how the ship is used going forward.\u201d",
      "The damaged warship was North Korea\u2019s second known destroyer and seen as a crucial asset toward Kim\u2019s goal of modernizing its naval forces. It was in the same class as the country\u2019s first destroyer unveiled in April, which experts assessed as the North\u2019s largest and most advanced warship to date. Kim lavishly praised that ship, which was launched in the western port of Nampo, saying it advances his goal of expanding the military\u2019s operations range and nuclear strike capabilities.",
      "State media described that ship as designed to handle various weapons systems, including anti-air and anti-ship weapons as well as nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles. Kim also supervised test-firings of missiles from the destroyer afterward, and state media said the ship was expected to enter active duty early next year.",
      "While North Korea\u2019s naval forces are widely seen as far inferior to those of its rivals, analysts say a destroyer equipped with modern missile and radar systems could still boost the North\u2019s offensive and defensive capabilities.",
      "South Korean officials and experts say the North\u2019s destroyer was likely built with Russian assistance as the two countries\u2019 military cooperation have intensified amid Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine. Kim\u2019s government has supplied Russia with thousands of troops and large shipments of military equipment, including artillery and ballistic missiles, to support its warfighting. Washington and Seoul have expressed concern that, in return, Kim may seek Russian technology transfers that could enhance the threat posed by his nuclear-armed military.",
      "Kim met with Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu in Pyongyang on Wednesday in the latest sign of the countries\u2019 deepening ties.",
      "Kim has framed his arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and South Korea, which have been expanded joint military exercises in reaction to the North\u2019s advancing nuclear program. Kim says the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening the North Korean navy.",

      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia saw a 33% drop in deforestation in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year, the environment ministry said Thursday, citing stronger community coordination and a crackdown on environmental crime.",
      "Speaking at a press conference, Environment Minister Lena Estrada A\u00f1okazi said deforestation fell from 40,219 hectares in early 2024 to 27,000 hectares this year. The government identified 18 active deforestation hot spots, including 13 in the Amazon and others in regions like Catatumbo, Arauca and the Pacific north.",
      "\u201cIn the Amazon\u2019s national parks, deforestation dropped by 54% ... which is a very good result,\u201d Estrada said, highlighting gains in Amazonian parks Tinigua, Chiribiquete and La Macarena.",
      "The Amazon remains Colombia\u2019s most affected region, accounting for 69% of the country's deforestation. The departments \u2014 Colombia\u2019s main administrative divisions \u2014 of Meta, Caquet\u00e1 and Guaviare saw the biggest declines, while Putumayo had a slight increase.",
      "Estrada attributed the decline to the government\u2019s integrated plan to curb deforestation, which includes community agreements, institutional strengthening, and joint operations with the Defense Ministry and Attorney General\u2019s Office.",
      "A recent report by Colombia\u2019s inspector general noted that while deforestation dropped overall, pressure on protected areas remains intense, with illegal coca cultivation and unregulated mining advancing into national parks. The independent watchdog said that between October 2024 and March 2025, nearly 88,900 hectares of forest were lost nationwide, much of it in areas designated for environmental conservation.",
      "The minister said the efforts have led to key arrests, including of individuals tied to the environmental sector.",
      "Looking ahead, Estrada outlined a territorial action plan to further engage local and Indigenous authorities. A series of regional meetings is set to begin in June, starting in Villavicencio with Amazon and Orinoquia leaders.",
      "Deforestation in Colombia is mostly driven by land grabbing, illegal road building, cattle ranching, illicit mining and coca cultivation, the raw ingredient to produce cocaine.",

      "The draft resolution, which was seen by The Associated Press, says: \u201cIran\u2019s many failures to uphold its obligations since 2019 to provide the Agency with full and timely cooperation regarding undeclared nuclear material and activities at multiple undeclared locations in Iran ... constitutes non-compliance with its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement.\u201d",
      "The draft resolution furthermore finds that the IAEA's \u201cinability ... to provide assurance that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is exclusively peaceful gives rise to questions that are within the competence of the United Nations Security Council, as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.\u201d",
      "It requests IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi \u201cto continue his efforts to implement this and previous resolutions and to report again, including any further developments on the issues.\"",
      "The text of the draft may change before it is formally tabled, as board members have the opportunity to suggest amendments.",
      "Under the so-called safeguards obligations, that are part of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran is legally bound to declare all nuclear material and activities and allow IAEA inspectors to verify that none of it is being diverted from peaceful uses.",
      "In the IAEA\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive report\u201d that was circulated among members states last weekend, the U.N. nuclear watchdog said that Iran\u2019s cooperation with the agency has \u201cbeen less than satisfactory\u201d when it comes to uranium traces discovered by agency inspectors at several locations in Iran that Tehran has failed to declare as nuclear sites.",
      "The IAEA has been seeking answers from Iran regarding the origin and current location of the nuclear material since 2019.",
      "Western officials suspect that the uranium traces discovered by the IAEA could provide evidence that Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program until 2003.",
      "Iran denies ever having had a nuclear weapons program and says its program is entirely peaceful.",
      "The senior western diplomat called the resolution a \u201cserious step,\u201d but added that western nations are \u201cnot closing the door to diplomacy on this issue.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe objective of the resolution is for Iran to resolve the issue,\u201d the source added, which is why the resolution will not immediately refer Iran\u2019s non-compliance to the U.N. Security Council to consider triggering more sanctions. \u201cThey will have a window to finally comply and respond to all the requests that have been made over the last six years.\u201d",
      "The board of governors \u201cstresses its support for a diplomatic solution to the problems posed by the Iranian nuclear programme, leading to an agreement that addresses all international concerns related to Iran\u2019s nuclear activities, encouraging all parties to constructively engage in diplomacy,\u201d the draft resolution reads.",
      "However, if Iran fails to cooperate, an extraordinary IAEA board meeting will likely be held in the summer, during which another resolution could get passed that will refer the issue to the Security Council, the senior diplomat said.",
      "The three European nations have threatened in the past to reinstate sanctions that have been lifted under the original 2015 Iran nuclear deal, which expires on Oct. 18.",
      "Iran has previously retaliated to resolutions passed by the agency's board by further expanding its nuclear program and banning inspectors.",
      "Iranian deputy foreign minister Kazem Gharibabadi warned the IAEA against taking any \u201cpolitically-motivated action\u201d by some board members, as this could undermine cooperation between Iran and the UN nuclear watchdog, he wrote in a post on X.",

      "The advocate general for the European Union\u2019s highest court is urging the court to rule that Hungary violated EU law by restricting LGBTQ+ content for minors",
      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- The advocate general for the European Union\u2019s highest court on Thursday urged the court to rule that Hungary violated the bloc\u2019s laws and fundamental values when it passed legislation barring the availability of LGBTQ+ content to minors under 18.",
      "The non-binding opinion from the European Court of Justice\u2019s Advocate General, Tamara Capeta, states that the legislative changes adopted by Hungary's right-wing populist government violate several rights protected by the EU, \u201cnamely the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex and sexual orientation, the respect for private and family life, the freedom of expression and information, as well as the right to human dignity.\u201d",
      "Hungary's law, adopted in 2021 by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's ruling Fidesz party, prohibited the display of content to minors that depicts homosexuality or gender change, while also providing harsher penalties for crimes of pedophilia.",
      "The government has argued its policies, including a more recent law and constitutional amendment that effectively ban the popular Budapest Pride event, seek to protect children from what it calls \u201csexual propaganda.\u201d",
      "But critics of the legislation have compared it to Russia\u2019s gay propaganda law of 2013, and say it conflates homosexuality with pedophilia as part of a campaign ploy to mobilize Fidesz's conservative voter base.",
      "In her opinion, Capeta rejected Hungary's justification that the measures are aimed at protecting children, since the legislation \u201cprohibits portrayal of ordinary lives of LGBTI people, and is not limited to shielding minors from pornographic content, which was prohibited by the law in Hungary already.\u201d",
      "She also wrote that Hungary has not offered any proof that content which portrays the ordinary lives of LGBTQ+ people has a negative effect on the healthy development of minors.",
      "\u201cConsequently, those amendments are based on a value judgment that homosexual and non-cisgender life is not of equal value or status\u201d to heterosexual life, Capeta wrote.",
      "She urged the EU court to rule in favor of the bloc's executive commission \u2014 which launched an infringement procedure against Hungary over the law shortly after it was passed \u2014 on all counts.",
      "Opinions by advocates general are often but not always followed by the European Court of Justice, which will make a final ruling on the case at a later date.",

      "LUSAKA, Zambia -- Former Zambian President Edgar Lungu, who served as the leader of the southern African nation from 2015-2021, died Thursday, his daughter said. He was 68.",
      "Lungu's daughter, Tasila Lungu-Mwansa, announced his death in a video posted on the official Facebook page of his political party, the Patriotic Front. She said he died in a hospital in South Africa after having been under \u201cmedical supervision\u201d in recent weeks. Lungu-Mwansa, who is a lawmaker, did not give a cause of death.",
      "Lungu became president in 2015 to complete the term of Michael Sata after he died in office. Lungu was elected to a full presidential term in 2016, beating current Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema. Lungu later lost to Hichilema in the 2021 election.",
      "Lungu had sought to challenge Hichilema in next year's presidential election, but a court last year barred him from standing. The court ruled his time as president from 2015-2016 counted as a full term and said he had, therefore, served the maximum length of two terms.",
      "Lungu alleged there was political interference in the court ruling. His wife and other family members have faced corruption allegations.",
      "Lungu claimed last year that his movements were being monitored by police and he had effectively been placed under house arrest to restrict his return to politics. Police said it was standard to monitor former presidents for their safety.",

      "This year's Hajj in Saudi Arabia had the lowest attendance in 30 years excluding the pandemic period",
      "ISLAMABAD -- This year\u2019s Hajj in Saudi Arabia attracted the lowest number of pilgrims for 30 years, excluding the COVID-19 pandemic period, according to figures released Thursday.",
      "The annual Islamic pilgrimage attracted just 1,673,230 Muslims, the majority of them from outside Saudi Arabia, according to a post from the country\u2019s Hajj Ministry on the social platform X.",
      "Authorities did not immediately offer an explanation for the low turnout.",
      "It\u2019s almost 160,000 fewer pilgrims than last year and a far cry from the pre-pandemic boom, when attendance would regularly push past 2 million. There was a record-breaking Hajj in 2012, when more than 3.16 million Muslims took part.",
      "The kingdom ran a pared-down pilgrimage during the COVID-19 pandemic, sharply reducing the scale of the Hajj between 2020 and 2022 while still allowing a small number of the faithful to take part in the annual event.",
      "The Hajj in 2023 was the first to be held without restrictions since the start of the pandemic in 2020.",
      "At the Hajj, Muslims gather in Saudi Arabia to unite in religious rituals and acts of worship as they fulfil one of the Five Pillars of Islam, a religious obligation. It can be the spiritual experience of a lifetime for them and a chance to seek God\u2019s forgiveness and the erasure of past sins.",
      "But inflation and economic crises around the world are putting the Hajj out of reach for some. Excess heat and tougher rules for entry may have also deterred potential pilgrims from heading to Saudi Arabia this year.",
      "Earlier Thursday, pilgrims gathered in Arafat to spend hours in worship and contemplation. The rocky hill holds immense significance in Islam. Arafat is mentioned in the Quran and it is where the Prophet Muhammad is said to have given his last sermon on his final Hajj.",
      "On Friday, pilgrims will head to the vast tent city of Mina to carry out the symbolic stoning of the devil ritual by throwing pebbles at pillars.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- Pope Leo XIV met with members of the Vatican\u2019s child protection advisory commission on Thursday for the first time amid questions about his past handling of clergy sex abuse cases and demands from survivors that he enact a true policy of zero tolerance for abuse across the Catholic Church.",
      "The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, which is made up of religious and lay experts in fighting abuse as well as survivors, called the hourlong audience a \u201csignificant moment of reflection, dialogue, and renewal of the church\u2019s unwavering commitment to the safeguarding of children and vulnerable people.\u201d The group said it updated history's first American pope on its activities, including an initiative to help church communities in poorer parts of the world prevent abuse and care for victims.",
      "The Vatican did not provide the text of Leo's remarks or make the audio of the audience available to reporters.",
      "Pope Francis created the commission early on in his pontificate to advise the church on best practices and placed a trusted official, Boston\u2019s then-archbishop, Cardinal Sean O\u2019Malley, in charge.",
      "But as the abuse scandal spread globally during Francis' 12-year pontificate, the commission lost its influence its crowning recommendation \u2014 the creation of a tribunal to judge bishops who covered up for predator priests \u2014 went nowhere. After many years of reform and new members, it has become a place where victims can go to be heard and bishops can get advice on crafting guidelines to fight abuse.",
      "O\u2019Malley turned 80 last year and retired as archbishop of Boston, but he remains president of the commission and headed the delegation meeting with Leo in the Apostolic Palace.",
      "It has often fallen to O\u2019Malley to speak out on egregious cases that have arrived at the Vatican, including one that remains on Leo\u2019s desk: The fate of the ex-Jesuit artist, the Rev. Marko Rupnik, who has been accused by two dozen women of sexual, psychological and spiritual abuse over decades.",
      "After coming under criticism that a fellow Jesuit had apparently received preferential treatment, Francis in 2023 ordered the Vatican to waive the statute of limitations on the case and prosecute him canonically. But as recently as March, the Vatican still hadn\u2019t found judges to open the trial. Meanwhile, the victims are still waiting for justice and Rupnik continues to minister, with his supporters defending him and denouncing a \u201cmedia lynching\u201d campaign against him.",
      "Leo, the Chicago-born former Cardinal Robert Prevost, has been credited by victims of helping to dismantle an abusive Catholic movement in Peru, where he served as bishop for many years. But other survivors have asked him to account for other cases while he was a superior in the Augustinian religious order, bishop in Peru and head of the Vatican's bishops' office.",
      "The main U.S. survivor group, SNAP, has also called for Leo to adopt the U.S. policy calling for any priest who has been credibly accused of abuse to be permanently removed from ministry.",

      "Europe\u2019s top official monitoring illegal drugs is nearing the end of his decade-long tenure with one clear message: the non-stop rise in cocaine and other stimulants is producing more violence than ever before in the heart of the world\u2019s safest society",
      "Europe\u2019s top official monitoring illegal drugs has a parting message near the end of his tenure: the relentless rise in the trafficking of cocaine and other stimulants is producing more violence than ever before in the heart of the world\u2019s safest societies.",
      "Alexis Goosdeel, the Belgian clinician who has run the European Union Drugs Agency since Jan. 2016, has watched it unfold across the continent and spill into his home country. The bulk of drug seizures shifted from Europe's southern flank to its northern ports and, with Antwerp now a leading entry point for cocaine and crack, spreading gang violence has produced shootouts even near the seat of Europe\u2019s government.",
      "It's emblematic of the risk the continent at large faces, he told The Associated Press via video conference from Lisbon, Portugal, where his agency is based.",
      "\u201cFor people living in Brussels, that\u2019s the first time in the history of the country ... that you have episodes with weapons, with guns, in the center of Brussels,\u201d Goosdeel said. \u201cAnd this happens 2,000 meters (1.2 miles) from the building of the European Parliament, in a city that was felt and perceived by people to be quite safe.\u201d",
      "He noted the globalization of drug gangs \u2014 for example groups from the western Balkans arrested in Andean nations in South America. And he pointed to the new phenomena of gangs using social media to recruit at-risk youths, some of whom are recent arrivals to Europe as undocumented migrants.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t understand yet what are the root causes of this change of behavior among young teenagers or adolescents who embarked on ultra-violent behavior without having really a past of delinquency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some of them do not hesitate to take pictures or to make a movie of what they are doing and to share it on some social media.\u201d",
      "The European Union Drugs Agency\u2019s annual report released on Thursday found that in 2023 cocaine seizures in Europe hit a record for a seventh straight year, with 419 tonnes (462 tons) of cocaine confiscated by officials. Belgium led the way with 123 tonnes, followed by Spain (118 tonnes) and the Netherlands (59 tonnes), as the three countries with major ports accounted for 72% of the total amount grabbed by agents.",
      "The report, which covers the EU as well as Norway and Turkey, highlighted Spain\u2019s largest-ever seizure, of 13 tonnes of cocaine hidden in bananas from Ecuador, as an example of cartels' use of standard shipping lanes.",
      "Besides warning policymakers across the EU\u2019s 27 capitals to prepare for more violence, Goosdeel sounded the alarm about a looming public health threat. Whereas addiction and overdose from opioids can be treatable, that\u2019s not the case for stimulants.",
      "Their growing use \u201csuggests that in four or five years time we will face most probably an increase in the needs for treatment and we don\u2019t have any pharmacological standard treatment available,\u201d he said. \"You don\u2019t have anything magic in terms of medicine that would help to stabilize them, to cut the craving and to help them really disconnect from this extremely huge addiction. So it\u2019s time to invest.\u201d",
      "Europe remains the leading producer and exporter of ecstasy. The agency\u2019s early warning system to spot new synthetic drugs has identified 1,000 new substances in its 27 years of existence. Goosdeel said he wouldn't be surprised if, of the total, more than half were detected in the past decade. The period has ushered in \u201can entirely different world,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cDrugs are everywhere, including those we produce in Europe. Everything can be used as a drug,\u201d he said.",
      "Goosdeel insists that, while policymakers should tackle the issue of drug-related violence, they must continue caring for users rather than jailing or shunning them, as some critics say the United States\u2019 \u201cwar on drugs\u201d has done. Europe's approach has formed the basis of a public health response aimed at helping users overcome their addictions.",
      "\u201cWe have learned in Europe, and from what happens outside Europe, that to declare war on the people who are using drugs is not the solution,\u201d he said.",

India\u2019s current policy caps quotas at 50%, with 27% reserved for OBCs. A count of these groups will likely lead to calls to raise the quotas.",
      "Successive Indian governments have resisted updating caste data, arguing that it could lead to social unrest.",
      "The announcement on the census comes months ahead of a crucial election in India\u2019s poorest state of Bihar, where caste is a key issue. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s party runs a coalition government in Bihar.",

      "As those students wait to find out if they'll be able to attend the university, some are pursuing other options.",
      "Rising international enrollment has made Harvard and other elite colleges uniquely vulnerable to Trump's crackdown on foreign students. Republicans have been seeking to force overhauls of the nation's top colleges, which they see as hotbeds of \u201cwoke\u201d and antisemitic viewpoints.",
      "Garber says the university has made changes to combat antisemitism. But Harvard, he said, will not stray from its \u201ccore, legally-protected principles,\u201d even after receiving federal ultimatums.",
      "Trump's administration has also taken steps to withhold federal funding from Harvard and other elite colleges that have rejected White House demands related to campus protests, admissions, hiring and more. Harvard's $53 billion endowment allows it to weather the loss of funding for a time, although Garber has warned of \u201cdifficult decisions and sacrifices\u201d to come.",

      "He accused Trump of betraying promises to cut federal spending, shared a suggestion that the president should be impeached and claimed without evidence that the government was concealing information about his association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Perhaps most viciously, Musk insisted that Trump wouldn\u2019t have won last year\u2019s election without his help.",
      "Trump, not one to slouch from a fight, could hold back no longer. He posted that Musk had been \u201cwearing thin,\u201d that he had \u201casked him to leave\u201d his administration, that the tech titan had \u201cgone CRAZY.\u201d",
      "Maybe, Trump threatened, he should save taxpayer money by canceling government contracts and subsidies for Musk\u2019s companies.",
      "On and on it went, as liberals savored the spectacle of their most despised political opponents clawing at each other's digital throats and conservatives reeled at the prospect of having to pick sides. Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur and conspiracy theorist, saw an opportunity to position herself as the voice of reason.",
      "\u201cThis fight should be taken offline,\u201d she said \u2014 on social media, of course.",
      "The question now is whether Trump and Musk find some way to step back from a battle that is tearing apart one of the most consequential relationships in modern American politics. If they don\u2019t, there\u2019s little telling how far the fallout could spread from a collision between the world\u2019s most powerful man and its wealthiest.",
      "At stake are the future of Musk's companies, including electric automaker Tesla and rocket manufacturer SpaceX; government programs that rely on the billionaire entrepreneur's technology; legislation for advancing tax cuts and Trump's other priorities in Congress; Republican chances in next year's midterm elections; and an entire political ecosystem that has orbited around Trump and Musk's deteriorating partnership.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like India and Pakistan,\u201d said Republican Rep. Ryan Zinke of Montana, referring to two nuclear-armed nations that recently skirmished along their border. \u201cIt just escalates and neither one of them seem to back down and understand the strength of each other.\u201d",
      "Trump and Musk were always an odd pairing, with contrasting world views and deep generational and stylistic differences.",
      "Trump, 78, comes from old-school New York real estate and never appears in public without a suit and tie unless he's on the golf course. Before running for president, he became a household name as a reality television star.",
      "Musk, 53, is an immigrant from South Africa who struck it rich in Silicon Valley. In addition to running Tesla and SpaceX, Musk owns the social media company X. He's fashioned himself as a black-clad internet edgelord, and his wealth vastly outstrips Trump's.",
      "But Trump and Musk are kindred spirits in other ways. They're experts at generating attention who enjoy stirring the pot by riling up their opponents. Each has sought more power to accomplish existential quests. Trump assails the federal \u201cdeep state\u201d that resisted him during his first term, while Musk warns about the country going bankrupt from excessive spending and promotes an interplanetary future powered by his rocket technology.",
      "Musk endorsed Trump after the Republican candidate was nearly assassinated in Butler, Pennsylvania, and he began spending millions to support him. His social media megaphone was a powerful addition to Trump's comeback campaign, magnifying his efforts to court tech leaders and young, very online men.",
      "Trump rarely tolerates sharing the spotlight, but he seemed enamored with his powerful backer, mentioning him in stump speeches and welcoming him onstage at rallies.",
      "After the election, Musk was a fixture around Mar-a-Lago, posing for photos with Trump's family, joining them for dinner, sitting in on meetings. Instead of growing tired of his \u201cfirst buddy,\u201d Trump made plans to bring Musk along to Washington, appointing him to lead a cost-cutting initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "Musk tried to establish himself as the president's omniscient and omnipresent adviser. He held court in Cabinet meetings, slept over in the Lincoln Bedroom and helped himself to caramel ice cream from the White House kitchen.",
      "The federal bureaucracy practically trembled before Musk, who oversaw layoffs and downsizing with his team of acolytes and engineers embedded in various agencies.",
      "Musk appeared thrilled at his opportunity to tinker with the government and exulted in his bromance with Trump, posting on Feb. 7 that he loved the president \u201cas much as a straight man can love another man.\u201d",
      "Trump returned the favor on March 11, allowing Musk to line up Tesla vehicles on the White House driveway as his company was struggling with declining sales. Trump made a show of choosing a cherry red electric car for himself.",
      "But cracks were emerging, especially as Trump pursued tariffs that could raise costs for Musk's businesses. Musk said Peter Navarro, the president's trade adviser, was \u201ctruly a moron\" and \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks\" on April 8.",
      "The billionaire entrepreneur, who had never before worked in public service, seemed to be souring on government. He suggested there wasn't enough political will, either in Congress or in the White House, to adequately reduce spending.",
      "Trump started signaling that it was time for him to leave even though Musk said he would be willing to stay.",
      "Shortly before announcing his departure, Musk said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d by legislation that Trump called the \u201cbig beautiful bill\" because it would increase the deficit. The measure includes tax cuts, more money for border security and changes to Medicaid that would leave fewer people with health insurance.",
      "\u201cI think a bill can be big or it could be beautiful,\u201d Musk said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if it could be both.\u201d",
      "The criticism didn't prevent Trump from giving Musk a send-off in the Oval Office, where he presented his outgoing adviser with a ceremonial key.",
      "\u201cElon is really not leaving,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be back and forth.\u201d",
      "Musk said, \u201cI\u2019ll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president.\"",
      "It's hard to imagine that now.",
      "Musk escalated his attacks on the legislation Tuesday, calling it a \u201cdisgusting abomination,\" and Trump tried to fend off the criticism.",
      "\u201cHe hasn\u2019t said bad about me personally, but I\u2019m sure that will be next,\u201d the president said Thursday in the Oval Office during a meeting with the German chancellor.",
      "It was.",
      "Musk quickly took to X to vent his anger at Trump, saying his tariffs \u201cwill cause a recession in the second half of this year\u201d and accusing him of lying. He also said it was \u201cvery unfair\u201d that the legislation would eliminate tax incentives for electric vehicles.",
      "Trump fired back in real time as he tried to maintain momentum for his legislation, which faces a difficult debate in the Senate.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,\u201d the president posted. \u201cThis is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, some of Trump's allies plotted revenge.",
      "Steve Bannon, a former Trump adviser who hosts an influential conservative podcast, said the president should direct the U.S. government to seize SpaceX. He also encouraged Trump to investigate allegations that Musk uses drugs and \u201cgo through everything about his immigration status\" in preparation for potential deportation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll see how good Elon Musk takes a little of that pressure,\" Bannon said, \"because I happen to think a little of that pressure might be coming.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be U.S. surgeon general has said the nation\u2019s medical and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d",
      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.",
      "Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.",
      "Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.",
      "Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.",
      "Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.",
      "\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.",
      "While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.",
      "\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d",
      "Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.",
      "Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.",
      "He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.",
      "Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.",
      "Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.",
      "Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.",
      "\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The school graduation season is the busiest time of year for the Walmart workers who hand-decorate cakes per customers\u2019 orders",
      "NEW YORK -- Inside a Walmart store in New Jersey, a worker puts the finishing touches on a cake with an edible ink Sponge Bob on top. A colleague creates a buttercream rosette border for a different cake, while another co-worker frosts a tier of what will be a triple-deck dessert.",
      "It\u2019s graduation season, the busiest time of year for the 6,200 employees the nation's largest retailer trained to hand-decorate cakes per customers' orders. The cakes themselves come, pre-made, frozen and in a variety of shapes and sizes, from suppliers, not Walmart's in-store bakeries.",
      "But there\u2019s no sugar-coating the importance the company places on its custom cake business. Its army of icing artisans are the highest paid hourly workers in a typical U.S. Walmart, excluding managers. Cake decorators earn an average of $19.25 per hour, compared with $18.25 for all non-managerial store workers, a company spokesperson said.",
      "Melissa Fernandez, 36, started working in the electronics area and then the wireless services department of the Walmart in North Bergen, New Jersey, before she transferred to the deli area in search of better pay. But Fernandez had her eye on a cake decorating job and after spending two months getting trained by a store colleague, she picked up a piping bag full-time in 2021.",
      "\u201cI love baking at home. I love painting,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cI love doing anything artistic, and I just always wanted to be a part of it.\u201d After 11 years with Walmart, she said she now makes about $24.40 an hour.",
      "Despite their elite status within Walmart, the retailer's cake decorators have attracted detractors on social media. The company promotes its personalized baked goods on TikTok and encourages the workers behind such creations to do the same. Critics have accused Walmart decorators of stealing ideas and undercutting the work of professional cake artists with their low-priced products.",
      "After TikTok videos praising Walmart's $25 heart-shaped cakes with borders that resemble vintage lace cropped up before Valentine's Day this year, a few bakers produced their own videos explaining why their cakes cost so much more and critiquing Walmart's.",
      "Debates ensued in the comments sections over whether Walmart represented evils of capitalism or served the needs of the masses.",
      "A customized sheet cake that can be sliced to serve 96 people costs $59 at Walmart, about one-third to half the price that a nationwide sample of independent bakeries list online for similarly sized cakes. For $5.20 more, Walmart customers can add strawberry or \u201cBavarian creme\" fillings, which like the bare cakes, are vendor-supplied.",
      "The slice of the celebratory occasion cake market Walmart holds appears vast based on company-supplied figures. One out of four cakes sold in the U.S. comes from Walmart, and its employees will collectively decorate more than 1 million cakes during May and June, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "The number of cakes decorated each day at the location where Fernandez works nearly doubles to 50-60 when school graduations come around, compared to 30-35 a day during the rest of the year, said Michael DeMarco, the manager of the store's fresh food department. He credits the decorators' talent and promotional efforts on TikTok.",
      "\"We\u2019re getting a lot of repeat customers. We\u2019re doing a lot more business because of just the viral sensations,\u201d DeMarco said.",
      "A TikTok video that showed Fernandez designing a $24 version of a customized bouquet cake \u2014 12 cupcakes that are individually decorated and arranged to look like a bunch of flowers \u2014 received nearly a half-million views. The bouquet design was one of the North Bergen store's most popular cakes last month, a company spokesperson said.",
      "The dressy heart-shaped cakes, as well as cakes that resemble meals like sushi or a pile of spaghetti and meatballs, are popular too, she said. Fernandez also has created \u201cburn away\u201d cakes: an iced cake topped with an image printed on paper, which is set ablaze to reveal a different image underneath.",
      "\u201cTikTok helps me stay up to date,\u201d she said. \u201cA lot of trends that I see on there, within that week or within that month, customers will come asking about it. And we\u2019re pretty up to date as well.\u201d",
      "Jazzing up a cake by hand requires skill, whether or not someone else did the baking, she said. Funneling buttercream frosting through a bag and various sized piping tips to yield the desired design without misplaced blobs is not the same as drawing or painting, Fernandez explained.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure points that you have to practice in order to get the borders correct and the right thickness or the right texture,\u201d she said.",
      "Tiffany Witzke, who has been a Walmart cake decorator since July 2016 and works at a store in Springfield, Missouri, has more than 912,000 followers on TikTok. The job attracts people who \"can be extremely skilled and talented,\u201d Witzke said, adding that customers want increasingly complicated designs.",
      "\u201cWhen I first started, it was basically just borders and writing,\" she said. \u201cNow, everybody wants more and more and more on their cake.\u201d",
      "Liz Berman, owner of The Sleepy Baker, in Natick, Massachusetts, said she's not worried about losing customers to Walmart because of her attention to detail and the premium ingredients she uses.",
      "She charges $205 and up for a half-sized sheet cake, the bouquets made up of two dozen miniature cupcakes cost $110. All the cakes are made from scratch, and Berman said she designs everything herself.",
      "\u201cIt's just a totally different business model,\" she said. \u201cEverything I do is custom.\u201d",
      "For Walmart, the cake decorating business delivers higher profit margins than some other areas, such as groceries and electronics, according to Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor at market research firm Circana. But it's also resonating with shoppers looking for affordable luxuries.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve gone into a period where the consumer is saying, \u2018This is good enough,\u2019\" Cohen said.",
      "Customers interviewed at the North Bergen store on a recent weekday seemed to be satisfied. George Arango, 34, picked up two customized cakes, one to celebrate a co-worker's retirement and the other for a colleague getting another job. After researching prices on various store websites, he decided to give Walmart a try.",
      "\u201cThe price is fantastic,\" he said. \"I\u2019m walking out with two cakes for $40.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The legal aid group Lambda Legal has raised $285 million at a time when attacks on the rights of gay, intersex and transgender people have again intensified",
      "NEW YORK -- The nonprofit legal aid group Lambda Legal, which advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, has raised $285 million at a time when attacks on the rights of gay, intersex and transgender people have again intensified",
      "Lambda Legal CEO Kevin Jennings announced the results on Thursday, saying the group exceeded its original fundraising goal by $105 million.",
      "\u201cI think this is a statement by the LGBTQ+ community that we will not go back,\u201d said Lambda Legal CEO Kevin Jennings in an interview.",
      "The nonprofit has won court cases that ended bans on gay marriage in 2015 and that abolished laws that criminalized sex between gay adults in 2003. It launched the fundraising campaign quietly in 2022 in response to a wave of bills in state legislatures that targeted LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "Some of those laws sought to limit the discussion of sexuality and gender in schools, remove books featuring LGBTQ+ characters from school libraries, ban public drag shows, prohibit students from using their preferred pronouns and limit access to gender-affirming care for trans youth.",
      "This year, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has focused on transgender people. It has ordered trans people to leave the military, sought to remove fair housing protections for them and denied the existence of trans, nonbinary and intersex people through an executive order recognizing only two sexes.",
      "Trump has tried to cut federal funding for any gender-affirming medical care for trans children.",
      "Lambda Legal has brought multiple legal cases against the administration, including challenges to its ban on trans members in the military and on gender-affirming care for trans youth.",
      "Lambda Legal is a large nonprofit, spending more than $20 million annually since 2021 and holding assets exceeding $54 million in 2023, according to its tax filing.",
      "But the scale of this campaign significantly increases its resources.",
      "Jennings said since its founding in 1973, Lambda Legal had received three gifts of over $1 million. In this campaign, 14 individuals, two foundations and one law firm gave at least $1 million, with several giving tens of millions, he said.",
      "\u201cIt was really individuals in the community who stepped up and made this campaign happen,\" he said. \"It wasn\u2019t corporations. It wasn\u2019t law firms. It wasn\u2019t foundations.\u201d",
      "Among the donors is billionaire author MacKenzie Scott, who gave the nonprofit gifts in 2020 and 2021. The largest gift, $25 million, came from the Kathryn G. Graham Trust. Graham served as an early board member for Lambda Legal.",
      "Some $80 million of the raised funds will be spent in the next five years, with the remaining $205 million pledged by donors in their estates, often called planned gifts.",
      "Lambda Legal will use the infusion of cash to hire more attorneys, set up a new mechanism to coordinate pro bono representation from major law firms and hold public trainings about the rights of LGBTQ+ people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to win every battle,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to win every fight, but we\u2019re going to fight every fight and we will keep fighting and we will be able to keep fighting because of this campaign until we eventually win.\u201d",
      "Even with this new fundraising push, Lambda Legal's resources still fall short of the funding that has gone to conservative nonprofits that also use litigation to pursue public policy goals. For example, Alliance Defending Freedom has raised more than $100 million in each 2022 and 2023, according to its tax filings. The group has represented female athletes challenging sports participation by transgender women and girls and has challenged laws banning conversion therapy for LGBTQ+ children.",
      "The acceptance and visibility of gay, trans, intersex and gender queer people has transformed dramatically within the living memory of many Americans.",
      "In 1961, Illinois became the first state to decriminalize homosexuality. The American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder in 1972. But fights for equal treatment across social arenas and to protect against discrimination continued for decades.",
      "Two major Supreme Court decisions in the past 25 years reflect a rapid shift in public attitudes to support the rights of LGBTQ+ people. The first in 2003 struck down sodomy laws that criminalized sex between gay adults and the second, in 2015, eliminated bans on gay marriage.",
      "Marc Stein, a historian and professor at San Francisco State University, attributed those and other wins to the LGBTQ+ movements' mobilization, court-based strategies and direct protests.",
      "He also said over decades, the fundraising base of the movement changed significantly. In the 1950s and 60s, the movement largely was supported by its members.",
      "\u201cOne main source was that they published magazines and newsletters and had subscribers and had members that paid membership fees,\u201d Stein said, though some wealthy patrons also offered support. By the 1980s, the movement began pushing wealthy donors to give to LGBTQ+ causes, he said.",
      "\u201cI think there was a real change in that period from funding that kept the movement close to the community,\u201d Stein said. \u201cAnd then developments that led some, especially national organizations, to move away from the model of grassroots fundraising to a model of corporate and business fundraising.\u201d",
      "Now, numerous Pride events around the country \u2014 including San Francisco and New York City \u2014 are reporting budget shortfalls because corporate sponsors have withdrawn their support. Some experts say the corporate retreat from brand activism, which peaked between 2016 to 2022, is due to a changing cultural landscape and a growing number of consumers who don\u2019t want companies to take positions on social issues.",
      "Jennings of Lambda Legal noted the recent withdrawal of corporate money from supporting LGBTQ+ groups and credited his group's recent fundraising success to its individual donors, many of whom he said were motivated to prevent a rollback on the rights that had been won in their lifetimes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of cowardice on the part of corporate America right now. A lot of people, who two years ago couldn\u2019t wait to slap a rainbow on their logo, are no longer writing checks,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cI think Lambda turned to the community and the community responded. And sadly, corporate America, which a lot of groups have relied on, has given up the fight in some cases.\u201d",

      "Less than a week later, their potent political alliance met a dramatic end Thursday when the men attacked each other with blistering epithets. Trump threatened to go after Musk's business interests. Musk called for Trump's impeachment.",
      "Here's a look at the implosion of their relationship in their own words.",
      "\u201cToday it's about a man named Elon. And he's one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced. He stepped forward to put his very great talents into the service of our nation and we appreciate it. Just want to say that Elon has worked tirelessly helping lead the most sweeping and consequential government reform program in generations.\u201d \u2014 Trump, May 30, Oval Office remarks",
      "___",
      "Trump invited cameras into the Oval Office last week to bid farewell to Musk, who said he was stepping away from his government work to focus on his businesses.",
      "Trump spoke effusively of Musk and his work with the Department of Government Efficiency for nearly 15 minutes straight.",
      "\"I'll continue to be visiting here and be a friend and adviser to the president,\" Musk said. He marveled at the gold-tinged decorations Trump placed around the Oval Office.",
      "\u201cThe oval office finally has the majesty that it deserves thanks to the president,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I just can\u2019t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\u201d \u2014 Musk, Tuesday, post on X.",
      "___",
      "Days after their Oval Office meeting, Musk escalated his previously restrained criticism of Trump's \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d budget bill, the president's top congressional priority.",
      "Still, he kept his critique focused on their policy disagreement. He did not go after Trump by name, even as he called on Republican lawmakers to vote down the bill and threatened political retribution against those who took Trump's side.",
      "\u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people,\u201d Musk wrote on X.",
      "Uncharacteristically for a man who rarely lets a snub go unanswered, Trump did not respond. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Musk's views on the bill were not a surprise to Trump, and his social media posting \u201cdoesn\u2019t change the president\u2019s opinion.\u201d",
      "Musk continued Wednesday, approvingly sharing social media posts and memes that criticized the budget's price tag and deficit impacts, though still directing his ire at Congress.",

      "___",
      "Trump said he was \u201cvery disappointed in Elon\" and was surprised by his benefactor's criticism.",
      "The war of words escalated rapidly from there. It all played out on their respective social media platforms, with Musk posting on X and Trump on Truth Social.",
      "Musk dismissed Trump's criticism. \u201cWhatever,\u201d he wrote. He shared old Trump social media posts urging lawmakers to oppose deficit spending and increasing the debt ceiling.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\" Musk posted, a reference to Musk's record political spending last year, which topped $250 million.",
      "\u201cSuch ingratitude,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump said Musk had worn out his welcome at the White House and was mad that Trump was changing electric vehicle policies in ways that would financially harm Musk-led Tesla.",
      "\u201cElon was \u2018wearing thin,\u2019 I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\u201d Trump wrote.",
      "He added: \u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn\u2019t do it!\u201d",
      "\u201cTime to drop the really big bomb: Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT!\u201d \u2014 Musk, Thursday, X post.",
      "___",
      "In a series of posts, he shined a spotlight on ties between Trump and Jeffrey Epstein, the financier who killed himself while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. Some loud voices in Trump's \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d movement claim Epstein's suicide was staged by powerful figures, including prominent Democrats, who feared Epstein would expose their involvement in trafficking. Trump's own FBI leaders have dismissed such speculation and there's no evidence supporting it.",
      "Later, when an X user suggested Trump be impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance, Musk agreed.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,\u201d Trump wrote. He went on to promote his budget bill.",

      "The Department of Labor last week announced a nationwide \u201cpause of operations\u201d for dozens of Job Corps centers run by private contractors. The department cited an internal review that concluded the program was costly and had a low success rate.",
      "The review also identified safety issues at the residential campuses. The Department of Labor said it would transition students and staff out of the locations by June 30.",
      "The program was designed for teenagers and young adults who struggled to finish high school in traditional school settings and then go on to obtain training and find jobs. Participants received tuition-free housing, meals and health care.",
      "Critics have argued that closing the campuses would leave young people homeless and deprive them of opportunities and hope. They also maintained the Trump administration did not have legal authority to suspend Job Corps because it was created by Congress.",
      "Lawmakers asked Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer about the decision when she appeared before the House Education and Workforce Committee on Thursday.",
      "\u201cJob Corps, which you know has bipartisan support in Congress, trains young, low-income people, and helps them find good-paying jobs and provides housing for a population that might otherwise be without a home,\u201d U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott said.",
      "Scott, a Virginia Democrat, read from a letter Chavez-DeRemer wrote in support of Job Corps last year. The letter said the program increased participants' employment and wages, and decreased their reliance on public benefits.",
      "\u201cYou've made a starkly abrupt shift from a champion to a destroyer of this important program,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon, adding that students in her district were distraught.",
      "In response, Chavez-DeRemer said she recognized that only an act of Congress could eliminate Job Corps. She said the Labor Department had instead used its authority to halt the program's operations but planned to comply with a federal court order that temporarily blocked the action.",
      "U.S. District Judge Andrew Carter of New York issued a temporary restraining order on Wednesday that prohibited the Labor Department from terminating jobs, removing students from the 99 contractor-run centers or eliminating the Job Corps program without congressional authorization.",
      "The order was sought as part of a lawsuit filed Tuesday by the National Job Corps Association, a trade group which includes business, labor, volunteer and community organizations. The group alleged the Labor Department's decision would have disastrous consequences, including displacing tens of thousands of vulnerable young people and forcing mass layoffs.",
      "During Thursday's House committee hearing, Scott asked several Job Corps students in attendance to stand.",
      "\u201cThese students were on their way to getting a good job and earning a living wage. On behalf of them, I urge you to immediately reverse the decision to effectively shut down all Job Corps centers,\u201d Scott said.",
      "Chavez-DeRemer responded that the Trump administration wanted to eliminate ineffective training interventions. The report released in April by the Labor Department's Employment and Training Administration said Job Corps operated at a $140 million deficit during the last fiscal year and had an average graduation rate of under 39%.",
      "\u201cOur recently released Job Corps transparency report showed that in 2023 alone, more than 14,000 serious incidents were reported at the Job Corps centers, including cases of sexual assault, physical violence, and drug use,\u201d Chavez-DeRemer said. \u201cThis program is failing to deliver safe and successful outcomes our young people deserve.\u201d",
      "The National Job Corps Association maintained the statistics were misleading. It said the 14,000 serious incidents included power outages, inclement weather, athletic injuries that required treatment and adult students leaving campus without prior approva.",
      "The group also said that Job Corps' graduation rates have historically been above 60%, but were depressed by COVID-19 policies during the year the Labor Department reviewed.",
      "Seth Harris, senior fellow at the Burnes Center for Social Change at Northeastern University, said in an interview that Job Corps is wildly popular on Capitol Hill. He recalled having to slow down Job Corps due to funding challenges when he served as acting secretary of labor during former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cI got angry calls from elected members of the House and Senate on both sides of the aisle,\u201d Harris said.",

      "The Labor Department shutting down Job Corps would be illegal because there\u2019s a process outlined for closing down the centers which includes publishing performance data, justifying the closure and allowing time for public comment and remediation, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is plainly illegal,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut it is entirely on brand for Donald Trump to beat up on poor kids, largely kids of color, who are trying to make their lives better.\u201d",

      "Spirits maker Brown-Forman is reporting weaker sales as it confronts challenging market conditions amid trade conflicts and pinched consumer spending",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Brown-Forman Corp. reported weaker sales Thursday as the maker of Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey confronts challenging market conditions amid global trade conflicts and pinched consumer spending.",
      "The Louisville, Kentucky-based spirits giant said its full-year net sales of nearly $4 billion were down 5% from a year ago, and fell 7% in in the fourth quarter. Net income was down 15% for the full fiscal year and plunged 45% in the fourth quarter ending April 30, the company said.",
      "The quarterly drop came as Brown-Forman and other U.S. spirits producers who rely heavily on foreign sales felt the reverberations from President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff plans and consumer anxiety about the economy.",
      "Brown-Forman also offered a sobering assessment for the coming year.",
      "Having steered the company through an \u201cextremely challenging and uncertain operating environment\u201d in the past year, Brown-Forman CEO Lawson Whiting predicted another challenging year ahead.",
      "\u201cFiscal 2025 was a year unlike any other that I\u2019ve seen in the past three decades,\u201d he said during a conference call with industry market analysts.",
      "Whiting pointed to industry figures showing that many consumers are purchasing smaller sizes of spirits. He called it unusual and said it reflects a consumer \u201cwho\u2019s pinched and just goes to the store with a $10 bill instead of $20 and then they get the smaller size.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe consumer and their wallet just doesn\u2019t have as much money in it,\" he said. \"They\u2019re spending money on things like vacations and lodging, and other things like that. But then when it trickles down and they go to the grocery store, I think in some cases, spirits have fallen out of the basket a little bit.\u201d",
      "In its outlook for the next year, the company said the challenges include continued consumer uncertainty and the \u201cpotential impact from currently unknown tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe know it's highly volatile,\" Leanne Cunningham, the company\u2019s CFO, said while fielding a question about tariffs during the conference call. \"None of us can predict what\u2019s going on.\"",
      "The company believes the market volatility will \"create sustained levels of consumer uncertainty, which we believe will lead to another year of below historical total distilled spirits trends,\u201d she said.",
      "Trump has often announced changes and pauses to his sweeping tariff plans on his social media platform. Trump hiked nearly all of his tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a punishing 50% on Wednesday in a move that\u2019s set to hammer businesses from automakers to home builders, and likely push up prices for consumers even further.",
      "Brown-Forman executives said Thursday that American spirits brands mostly remain off store shelves in Canada. Trump has angered Canadians with his trade war and calls to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Spirits makers in Kentucky have expressed fears of becoming \"collateral damage\u201d by getting caught up in trade conflicts.",
      "\u201cThe uncertainty of the tariffs continues to weigh down distilleries large and small,\" Chris Swonger, president and CEO of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, said in a statement Thursday. \"We are urging the Trump administration to help get the spirits sector back to fair and reciprocal trade with zero-for-zero tariffs with our major trading partners.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Brown-Forman's full-year results showed that net sales for its whiskey products were flat. Growth from Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey and its Woodford Reserve brand was offset by the negative effect of foreign exchange and declines in other super-premium Jack Daniel's products, it said.",
      "The company will launch a new product, Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Blackberry, this summer.",
      "\u201cBlackBerry is a globally recognized, well-established flavor trend, and naturally complements the flavor of Jack Daniel\u2019s Tennessee Whiskey,\" Whiting said.",
      "In January, Brown-Forman announced it was reducing its global workforce by about 12% and closing its hometown barrel-making plant in Louisville. Whiting reaffirmed Thursday that those actions are expected to produce about $70 million to $80 million in annualized cost savings.",

      "The U.S. declined to label China a currency manipulator in a new Treasury report, but accuses Beijing of standing out among America\u2019s major trading partners for lacking transparency",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. declined to label China a currency manipulator in a new Treasury report released Thursday, but accuses Beijing of standing out among America's major trading partners for lacking transparency in its exchange rate policies.",
      "Treasury\u2019s semi-annual report to Congress \u2014 called Macroeconomic and Foreign Exchange Policies of Major Trading Partners of the United States\u2014 comes as the Trump administration seeks to strike a trade deal with China, averting a trade war that has been brewing between the two nations.",
      "A Treasury official told reporters previewing the report that the U.S. could in the future find evidence that China is manipulating its currency and will make a determination in the fall whether China has been manipulating the renminbi, also known as RMB.",
      "During President Donald Trump 's first term, the Treasury, which was then led by Secretary Steve Mnuchin, labeled China a currency manipulator in 2019 \u2014 before then the U.S. had not put China on the currency blacklist since 1994.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said the administration \u201chas put our trading partners on notice that macroeconomic policies that incentivize an unbalanced trading relationship with the United States will no longer be accepted.\u201d",
      "\u201cMoving forward, Treasury will use all available tools at its disposal to implement strong countermeasures against unfair currency practices,\u201d he said.",
      "The decision not to sanction China for currency manipulation comes after Trump said Thursday that his first call with China's Xi Jinping since returning to office was \u201cvery positive,\u201d announcing that the two countries will hold trade talks in hopes of breaking an impasse over tariffs and global supplies of rare earth minerals.",
      "\u201cOur respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media platform after the call, which he said lasted an hour and a half.",
      "Trump has lowered his 145% tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% for 90 days to allow for talks. China also reduced its taxes on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. The back and forth has caused sharp swings in global markets and threatens to hamper trade between the two countries.",

      "A fuel leak and several improperly installed parts were found inside the engine of an American Airlines plane that caught fire after the plane landed in Denver in March, according to a report released Thursday.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said one part inside the right engine of the Boeing 737-800 was loose and had been installed in the wrong direction and that fuel was leaking from the fitting of another part that was also fastened incorrectly.",
      "The preliminary findings don't identify the cause of the fire because the NTSB won't reach that conclusion until after it completes its investigation likely sometime next year.",
      "But former NTSB and FAA investigator Jeff Guzzetti said the problems investigators found in the engine appear to be the source of the fuel that caught fire.",
      "\u201cTo me, it looks like improper maintenance in the right engine leading to a fuel leak,\u201d Guzzetti said after reading the NTSB report.",
      "Photos and videos posted online showed billowing smoke and passengers standing on the plane\u2019s wing after it taxied to a gate at Denver International Airport. Twelve people were taken to the hospital with minor injuries.",
      "The plane carried 172 passengers and six crew. The NTSB said gate workers extinguished the fire within a minute even before firefighters arrived and doused lingering hot spots on the plane.",
      "American Airlines said in a statement that \u201cthe safety of our customers and team members is our top priority, and we are cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation.\u201d",
      "Pictures included in the NTSB report show streaks on the outside of the engine from the leaking fuel, and airport video showed a trail of fluid leaking from under the right engine as the airplane taxied to the gate.",
      "Guzzetti said he believes those streaks were probably made while the plane was flying. After it landed, he said, the fuel likely pooled inside the engine and caught fire.",
      "The American Airlines flight had left Colorado Springs Airport and was bound for Dallas-Fort Worth when it diverted to Denver on March 13 after the crew reported high engine vibrations. The plane's right engine caught fire after it arrived at the gate.",
      "Passengers started yelling \u201cfire\u201d and \u201csmoke\u201d shortly after the plane pulled up to the gate, and flight attendants saw smoke beginning to fill the cabin, according to the NTSB report.",
      "The flight attendants tried calling the flight crew and knocking on the cockpit door, but got no answer. So the report said the flight attendants initiated the evacuation.",
      "Passengers were able to use the jetway at the front left door and the escape slide at the right rear door as well as the left over-wing doors to evacuate. But the left rear door wouldn't open, and maintenance personnel discovered afterward that the escape slide had jammed in the door.",
      "The faulty slide was sent to the manufacturer for further investigation.",
      "The country has seen a recent spate of aviation disasters and close calls stoking fears about air travel even though flying remains a very safe mode of transportation.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.",
      "Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world\u2019s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation\u2019s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His order applies only to Harvard, but it poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.",
      "It\u2019s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump\u2019s gatekeeping powers.",
      "\u201cColumbia\u2019s exposure to this \u2018stroke of pen\u2019 risk is uniquely high,\u201d the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.",
      "People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia\u2019s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.",
      "Other highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.",
      "America\u2019s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.",
      "It was part of a \u201cgold rush\u201d in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.",
      "\u201cWhether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.",
      "The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren\u2019t eligible for financial aid, and at some schools they pay two or three times the tuition rate charged to U.S. students. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.",
      "But the expansion wasn\u2019t equal across all types of colleges \u2014 public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don\u2019t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their numbers of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by the rising costs and student debt loads.",
      "Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation\u2019s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.",
      "In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard\u2019s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia\u2019s schools.",
      "The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.",
      "\u201cThat was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, \u2018If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.",
      "\u201cWe have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can\u2019t get in because we have foreign students there,\u201d Trump said at a news conference.",
      "The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard \u201cyet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of \u201ca painstaking, decades-long project\u201d to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school\u2019s mission and reputation, it said.",
      "\u201cIn our interconnected global economy,\" the school said, \u201ca university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d",

      "WhyHunger is celebrating 50 years of fighting to eradicate hunger at its root",
      "NEW YORK -- WhyHunger would have liked to be out of service by now.",
      "Singer-songwriter Harry Chapin and radio DJ Bill Ayres founded the grassroots support organization in 1975 with the idea they could eradicate hunger at its root by leveraging their music industry connections to fund community groups advancing economic and food security. And, yet, the global nonprofit is hitting the half-century mark this year \u2014 an anniversary that reflects the sobering need for continued food assistance.",
      "\u201cIt is pride and shame in equal measure,\u201d said Jen Chapin, the daughter of Harry Chapin and a WhyHunger board member, at the nonprofit's gala Wednesday night. \u201cThat this organization is still relevant when hunger is a completely solvable problem \u2014 it\u2019s embarrassing.\u201d",
      "Established amid transformative expansions of federal food programs just before the United States significantly cut social welfare, WhyHunger marks its 50-year milestone at a time of worsening food insecurity worldwide when some of the wealthiest countries are decreasing their humanitarian commitments.",
      "As part of the Trump administration's swift scaling back of the federal government, funding streams are being shut off for many in the nonprofit\u2019s network that help millions of hungry people access nutritious food.",
      "Chapin said the immense need, and \u201cthat the political conversation has gone backward,\u201d would be \u201cinfuriating\u201d to her late father.",
      "\u201cBut he wouldn\u2019t pause to rant,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019d be like, \u2018OK, what can we do?\u2019\u201d",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates more than 47 million people, including nearly 14 million children, lived in food-insecure households in 2023 \u2014 a crisis WhyHunger blames on \u201cdeeper systemic issues\u201d of rising inflation, the rollback of pandemic relief and poor wages.",
      "Those statistics were \u201cridiculous\u201d to Grammy award-winning rockers Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo. The couple, which performed its hit \u201cLove Is a Battlefield,\u201d was recognized Wednesday with the ASCAP Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award, given to artists who use their influence to foster social justice.",
      "Giraldo said they\u2019ve been involved with WhyHunger for 30 years. The support began with their relationship to Harry Chapin and his family, as well as their advocacy for children\u2019s causes.",
      "\u201cMusic brings so many people together,\u201d Benatar told the Associated Press. \u201cI think it's just always a good start.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we can help in any way, that's what we're trying to do: just be helpers,\u201d Giraldo added.",
      "The annual awards gala, hosted by Jazz at Lincoln Center\u2019s Frederick P. Rose Hall, raised more than $125,000 on Wednesday night alone.",
      "The proceeds directly supported WhyHunger's programs in the U.S. and 24 other countries. The nonprofit aims to not only feed people but create systems-level change by training local farmers, connecting people to government benefits, promoting indigenous food sovereignty and defending food workers' rights.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not enough to feed people for a day,\u201d Jen Chapin said. \"It\u2019s not even enough to teach a man to fish so that he can get his own food. You have to also create the social movement so that there is a food system that enables that farmer, that fisherperson, to get a fair price for their work, feed their local community.\u201d",
      "Among the benefactors were WhyHunger Board of Directors Chair Cindy Secunda and billionaire Bloomberg L.P. co-founder Tom Secunda, whose family foundation has contributed over $8 million to WhyHunger since 2020.",
      "Like many WhyHunger supporters, Cindy said she was first introduced to their work during Harry Chapin concerts in college. She would donate $10 or so, per his end-of-show requests. But she said she didn't ramp up her giving until more recently when she was invited to see the work of WhyHunger's partners up close.",
      "\u201cThey get so much more done with such a small staff,\" she said. \"I\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit has not increased its staff totals much over its 50 years to \u201cstay nimble and serve those who are serving,\u201d according to Chapin.",
      "The biggest change has been the philanthropic sector's overall approach to fighting food insecurity, staff say. Paternalistic, top-down attitudes toward aid were more dominant when the organization was founded. The idea that hunger is connected to issues of racism and climate was not as widespread then, according to Debbie DePoala, WhyHunger's senior director of communications",
      "The nonprofit has long centered public policy in conversations about hunger, according to Jan Poppendieck, a former board member and CUNY professor who has studied the history of food assistance. She hopes the outlook isn't lost.",
      "\u201cWhat they have done best is assist local innovative progressive organizations,\" Poppendieck said. \u201cAssist them financially because of this ability, as I say, to extract moolah from the entertainment industry, and assist them with sharing best practices, introducing them to each other, bringing them together so that people can learn from each other.\u201d",

But the magnitude of Musk\u2019s support for Trump, spending at least $250 million backing his campaign, and the scope of free rein the president gave him to slash and delve into the government with the Department of Government Efficiency is eclipsed only by the speed of their falling-out.",
      "Musk offered up an especially stinging insult to a president sensitive about his standing among voters: \u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election,\u201d Musk retorted. \u201cSuch ingratitude,\u201d Musk added in a follow-up post.",
      "Musk first announced his support for Trump shortly after the then-candidate was nearly assassinated on stage at a Pennsylvania rally last July. News of Musk's political action committee in support of Trump's election came days later.",
      "Musk soon became a close adviser and frequent companion, memorably leaping in the air behind Trump on stage at a rally in October.

      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Shaquille O\u2019Neal and Allen Iverson once clashed on the court in the 2001 NBA Finals, but now the basketball legends are joining forces to revive the Reebok brand they helped make iconic.",
      "In the Netflix docuseries, \u201cPower Moves,\u201d which premiered this week, the Hall of Famers swap jerseys for executive titles, with O'Neal stepping in as president of Reebok Basketball while Iverson takes on the role as vice president. The six-episode series offers a behind-the-scenes look at their mission to spark a cultural resurgence for the classic sneaker company.",
      "O\u2019Neal, standing 7-foot-1, sees himself as a voice for today\u2019s big men. But when it comes to reaching the quick, gritty guards of this generation, he knows there\u2019s no better ambassador than the 6-foot Iverson, whose \u201990s signature shoes are still a staple in sneakerhead circles.",
      "\u201cI didn't build Reebok all by myself,\u201d said O'Neal, who won three straight NBA titles with the Los Angeles Lakers and another with the Miami Heat. He signed with Reebok in 1992 and made the brand popular with his first signature shoe, called the Shaq Attaq.",
      "Iverson's signature shoes, The Question and The Answer, were some of the top sellers in the industry. He signed a lifetime endorsement and marketing contract with Reebok in 2001.",
      "\u201cI needed A.I. to be vice president because if you're a guard, you want to see a legendary guard,\u201d he said. \"I wanted to do a show that\u2019s not scripted. Not polished. I wanted it to be real work.\u201d",
      "Iverson called documenting his role in helping revitalize Reebok a \u201cfull circle moment\" while working alongside O'Neal, who he calls \u201cbig bro.\u201d",
      "\u201cI get the honor of doing this with (Shaq), having a relationship with him,\u201d said Iverson, the former Philadelphia 76ers guard, who was an 11-time All-Star and won the league\u2019s MVP in 2001 \u2014 the same year O'Neal and Iverson faced off in the NBA Finals. Iverson was known for being an undersized guard who played with a supersized heart.",
      "\u201cThe type of things I learn from him \u2014 on and off the court. He's just a beautiful guy,\" Iverson said about O'Neal. \"He stands up to his faults. The things that he felt he did wrong in life. The way he treats his mom. All that resembles who I am. That makes this special.\u201d",
      "Reebok, founded in 1895, became a household name in the early 1990s, thanks to Boston Celtics guard Dee Brown and his iconic Pump sneakers. The brand took off from there inking major deals with O\u2019Neal and Iverson, partnering with the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB, and even stepping into hip-hop with signature lines for Jay-Z and 50 Cent\u2019s G-Unit.",
      "But Reebok\u2019s cultural momentum began to fade after Nike doubled down on star power with Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. Adidas bought the company for $3.8 billion in 2006, aiming to better compete with Nike on a global scale.",
      "Instead, Reebok struggled to find its footing, gradually losing its identity in both sports and style.",
      "\u201cNow it's time for us to get Reebok back to prominence,\" said O'Neal, who played a key role in Reebok's acquisition in 2021 by Authentic Brands Group, where he is a shareholder. \u201cThere's all these competitive brands, which is fine. It makes the job harder. But for me, it's all about motivation and trying to build.\"",
      "\u201cPower Moves\u201d dives into Reebok\u2019s strategy for staying relevant, including signing rising stars like WNBA phenom Angel Reese to the brand\u2019s first name, image and likeness (NIL) deal. The series also shows how O\u2019Neal leans on a surprising source for insight into today\u2019s athletes through his son, Shareef.",
      "Shaq was initially set on creating high-top sneakers, until a visit to a massive Amateur Athletic Union tournament \u2014 with nearly 70 courts \u2014 sparked a shift. Shareef pulled his dad aside and explained that low tops are the go-to for this generation. It was a lightbulb moment that helped Shaq better understand and connect with modern players.",
      "\u201cI had to realize that my way is not always the right way,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cSometimes, the best way to be an effective leader is listening to the ones who are really in the trenches.\u201d",
      "Iverson believes he and Shaq can help Reebok bounce back by paying forward the same support and opportunity the brand once gave them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to show our love to the brand that showed us love,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our efforts into what they did in my life. Reebok took care of my family, my friends, me. It was a power move. We\u2019re here to bring it back.\u201d",

      "What Lee Zeldin didn\u2019t mention: how ending the rules could have devastating consequences to human health.",
      "The EPA-targeted rules could prevent an estimated 30,000 deaths and save $275 billion each year they are in effect, according to an Associated Press examination that included the agency\u2019s own prior assessments as well as a wide range of other research.",
      "It\u2019s by no means guaranteed that the rules will be entirely eliminated; they can\u2019t be changed without going through a federal rulemaking process that can take years and requires public comment and scientific justification.",
      "But experts say the numbers are conservative and that even a partial dismantling of the rules would mean more pollutants such as smog, mercury and lead \u2014 and especially more tiny airborne particles that can lodge in lungs and cause health problems. It would also mean higher emissions of the greenhouse gases driving Earth\u2019s warming to deadlier levels.",
      "\u201cMore people will die,\u201d said Cory Zigler, a professor of biostatistics at Brown University who has studied air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants. \u201cMore of this type of pollution that we know kills people will be in the air.\u201d",
      "The AP set out to look at what could happen if all the rules were eliminated, by first examining exhaustive assessments the EPA was required to produce before the rules were approved. Though the agency\u2019s priorities can change as presidential administrations change, the methods for the assessments have been largely standard since Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency and are deeply rooted in peer-reviewed scientific research.",
      "The AP used those and eight different government and private group databases for its estimate of financial costs, some death estimates and analysis of pollution trends. AP performed additional analysis of potential deaths by drawing on peer-reviewed formulas and scientific research on the impacts of increased heat and pollution. And AP vetted its work with multiple outside health experts, who said it is scientifically justified, but likely an undercount.",
      "Multiple experts say the science behind the rules is strong, and they pointed to the rigorous process that must be followed to change them, including requirements for public comment.",
      "Zeldin acknowledged as much last month.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to prejudge outcomes with what will be a lot of rulemaking,\u201d Zeldin said in April.",
      "Virtually all the benefits from the rules come from restricting the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. The fossil fuel industry was a heavy contributor to President Donald Trump\u2019s 2024 presidential campaign and Republicans overall. In announcing the proposed changes, the EPA repeatedly cited the costs of the rules and omitted the benefits in all but one instance.",
      "Asked for comment on the AP findings, an EPA spokesperson said the agency\u2019s plans would \u201croll back trillions in regulatory costs and hidden \u2018taxes\u2019 on U.S. families.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnlike the Biden EPA attempts to regulate whole sectors of our economy out of existence, the Trump EPA understands that we do not have to choose between protecting our precious environment and growing our economy,\u201d spokesperson Molly Vaseliou said.",
      "Scott Segal, an attorney at Bracewell LLP who represents energy and manufacturing interests, suggested that EPA analyses under the Biden administration emphasized worst-case scenarios, inflated health benefit claims and missed the big-picture economic benefits of booming industry.",
      "\u201cIf you only count lives saved by regulation, not lives harmed by regulation, the math will always favor more regulation,\u201d Segal said. \u201cThis framing misses the larger point: public health isn\u2019t just about air quality -- it\u2019s also about job security, housing, access to medical care, and heating in the winter.\"",
      "The EPA regulatory analyses are immense documents that numerous health and environment researchers and former officials say are grounded in science, not politics. For example, in January 2024, the EPA produced a 445-page analysis of tightening standards on dangerous particle pollution that cited more than 90 different scientific publications, along with scores of other documents. The Biden EPA presented four different regulatory scenarios and ultimately chose one of the middle options.",
      "Two experts who reviewed AP\u2019s work said the EPA documents that underpinned the analysis were themselves conservative in their estimates. University of Washington health and environment professors Kristi Ebi and Howard Frumkin said that\u2019s because EPA looked at added heat deaths and air pollution mortality, but did not include climate change\u2019s expected deaths from increased infectious disease, flooding and other disaster factors.",
      "\u201cThis is a rigorous, compelling and much-needed analysis,'' said Frumkin, who was appointed director of the CDC's National Center for Environmental Health during George W. Bush's administration. \u201dIt makes clear that regulatory rollbacks by the Trump administration will have major, direct consequences for health and well-being. Because of these regulatory rollbacks and funding cuts, Americans will die needlessly.\"",
      "That's a sentiment echoed by two former Republican EPA administrators, William Reilly and Christine Todd Whitman, who served in the George Bush and George W. Bush administrations respectively.",
      "\u201cThis administration is endangering all of our lives \u2014 ours, our children, our grandchildren,\u201d said Whitman, who led EPA under George W. Bush.",
      "A visit to Evansville, Indiana, helps show how EPA regulations have made a difference.",
      "The city of about 115,000 lies where the state's southwest tip meets Kentucky at the curving Ohio River. Industry lines the banks and coal barges float past carrying loads destined to fuel power plants.",
      "Kirt Ethridge, 30, grew up in Evansville and still lives there. As a child, he recalls looking down from high ground into the bowl-shaped valley where the heart of the city lies and seeing a haze of pollution atop it. He thought that was normal.",
      "He didn\u2019t think much of the looming smokestacks of the coal-fired power plants and factories that ringed the city, nor the line of inhalers waiting on a bench before he and his classmates ran the mile. He suffered asthma attacks in class, sometimes more than once a week, that sent him to the nurse\u2019s office. Once, he was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very scary feeling, particularly as a kid, to not be able to get enough air in your lungs,\u201d he said, describing it as like \u201cbreathing through a straw.\u201d",
      "In southwestern Indiana, coal-fired power plants were to blame for between 19,000 and nearly 23,000 deaths from 1999 to 2020, according to work by Zigler published in the journal Science that examined death rates among Medicare recipients and modeled where plants' pollution would spread.",
      "Nationally, he and his team found a sharp decline in air pollution deaths from coal-fired power plants after the mid-2000s, from an average of 43,000 a year to just 1,600 a year in 2020, with a similar cut in particle pollution. That's when two different forces came into play: Cheaper and less polluting natural gas pushed aside dirtier and costlier coal, while at the same time stricter regulations required more pollution control devices such as scrubbers.",
      "Duke Energy operates its biggest power plant near Evansville \u2014 Gibson Station, which can power about 2.5 million homes. Emissions have declined significantly as the company installed scrubbers that pull unwanted chemicals out of smokestacks, along with other pollution control technology. Duke Energy spokeswoman Angeline Protegere said the scrubbers were a response to \u201cregulations over the years as well as market factors.\u201d",
      "Put simply, the air got cleaner around places like Evansville. Vanderburgh County and neighboring counties violated national annual air standards for fine particles from 2005 to 2010, but no longer do, even as standards have tightened.",
      "The same is true across the United States. The amount of tiny airborne particles in the last 10 years nationwide is one-third lower than 2000-2009, EPA statistics show. Smog pollution is down nearly 15% and sulfur dioxide has plunged 80%.",
      "\u201cThe Clean Air Act, the EPA\u2019s founding legislation, has been a powerful engine for improving public health as our air has grown visibly clearer and cleaner,\u201d said Gina McCarthy, who headed the EPA under President Barack Obama and served as Biden's White House climate adviser. \u201cMillions of Americans have avoided illnesses, hospital visits, and premature deaths thanks to EPA\u2019s cleaner car and truck standards in concert with rules that limit industrial pollution.\u201d",
      "Five rules together were estimated to have more than $200 billion a year in net benefits, based on EPA documents that estimated reduced illnesses and deaths and the costs for companies to comply.",
      "Three rules dealt with cars and trucks. The \u201cclean car rule\u201d is a tightening of EPA emission standards for vehicles that was supposed to take effect for 2027 model years and eventually have annual net benefits of more than $100 billion a year, according to the agency\u2019s 884-page regulatory analysis. The EPA estimated that over the next three decades this rule alone would prevent 7.9 billion tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide, 8,700 tons of particulate matter and 36,000 tons of nitrogen oxides.",
      "Two other proposed rules \u2014 one that deals with car models from 2023 to 2027 and another aimed at heavy trucks and buses \u2014 are estimated to save nearly $38 billion a year combined through reduced health problems from air pollution, according to EPA\u2019s own detailed calculations.",
      "Almost none of those benefits are to be found in 10 fact sheets the EPA produced in conjunction with Zeldin's announcement. Nine make no mention of benefits from the rules, while eight mention the costs.",
      "In 17 of the 20 rules with explicit cost-benefit analyses, AP found that estimated benefits are larger than the costs \u2014 and sometimes far larger.",
      "For example, Biden\u2019s proposed power plant rule was designed to save more than $24 billion a year, prevent about 3,700 annual premature deaths and 3 million asthma incidents from fossil fuel-powered plants, according to EPA documents last year and work by the Environmental Protection Network. Under Trump, the EPA's fact sheet on that rule notes nearly $1 billion in costs but nothing about the far higher estimated benefits.",
      "Another rule the EPA updated last year sets standards for pollution permitted in the air, called National Ambient Air Quality Standards. The update, required by the Clean Air Act, cuts allowable soot particles by 25% to reflect new science on the harms from such pollution. The EPA in Biden's time calculated the change would annually save as much as $46 billion, 4,500 premature deaths and 800,000 asthma incidents.",
      "But the new EPA fact sheet only mentions the estimated costs of the change \u2014 about $614 million \u2014 and not benefits estimated at 76 times that amount.",
      "\u201cThe human body count and human health toll of particulate matter alone is just absolutely massive,\u201d said K. Sabeel Rahman, a Cornell law professor who was a top federal regulatory officer from 2021 to 2023. \u201cLiterally tens of thousands of people will lose their lives\" if the standard is rolled back, he said.",
      "In southwest Indiana, many people have noticed a positive difference from the EPA regulations. And they're concerned about changes.",
      "In Bloomfield, Jessica Blazier's 11-year-old son Julian has multiple health conditions that make him more sensitive to air quality, including nonallergic rhinitis, which inflames his nasal passage and makes breathing \u201cfeel like a knife sometimes,\" in his words. Jessica Blazier said the proposed EPA rule rollbacks are \u201calmost adding insult to injury in our particular circumstance.\u201d",
      "In Evansville, Ethridge is now raising kids of his own, including a 5-year-old daughter who was born early and doesn\u2019t tolerate respiratory illnesses well. Whenever Eliza gets sick, she uses a children\u2019s nebulizer that is shaped like a penguin and stored in an igloo-shaped case.",
      "\u201cI want to raise my kids in Evansville,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to raise my kids in a bowl of pollution.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Coco Gauff's first Grand Slam title came at the 2023 U.S. Open by beating Aryna Sabalenka in the final",
      "PARIS -- The biggest difference Coco Gauff sees between the player who lost her first Grand Slam final at the 2022 French Open at age 18, and the one who will play for the trophy again on Saturday at 21, this time against No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, is the way she views the importance of the occasion.",
      "Three years ago at Roland-Garros, Gauff was making her debut on that sort of stage and with that sort of prize at stake. It felt like the outcome meant absolutely everything, a burden that was a lot at the time and made her nervous.",
      "Now, the No. 2-ranked Gauff says, she understands \u201chow miniscule\u201d the result Saturday is in the scheme of things.",
      "\u201cEverybody is dealing with way bigger things in life than losing a final,\u201d the American said after beating 361st-ranked French wild-card entry Lo\u00efs Boisson 6-1, 6-2 in the semifinals Thursday.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure there are hundreds of players that would kill to win or lose a final, so just knowing that (makes) me realize how lucky and privileged I am to be in this position,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cAt first, I thought it would be the end of the world if I lost, and, you know, the sun still rose the next day. ... Regardless of the result, the sun will still rise.\u201d",
      "Here's another key difference: The Gauff of today is a Grand Slam champion. She won the 2023 U.S. Open; her opponent in that final just so happened to be Sabalenka.",
      "\u201cI just remember kind of feeling,\u201d Gauff said, \u201clike I was holding my breath to the match point.\u201d",
      "Their head-to-head series is tied 5-5 entering the first No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup in a French Open women's final since Serena Williams beat Maria Sharapova in 2023.",
      "Sabalenka beat Gauff in their most recent meeting, which came at the Madrid Open in May on the type of red clay used at Roland-Garros. So Gauff is well aware of Sabalenka's many talents, which were on full display during a 7-6 (1), 4-6, 6-0 semifinal victory over three-time defending champion Iga Swiatek.",
      "\u201cShe can come up with some big shots and big winners pretty much at all areas of the court,\u201d Gauff said about the 27-year-old from Belarus. \u201cShe's a fighter, as well. She's going to stay in the match regardless of the scoreline.\u201d",
      "After getting pushed to a third set by Swiatek, who had won 26 matches in a row at the French Open, Sabalenka was pretty much perfect down the stretch.",
      "Even Sabalenka called the lopsided nature of that last set \u201cshocking for me.\u201d",
      "She didn't make a single unforced error; Swiatek had 12.",
      "\u201cThe pace was from her (was) super fast,\u201d Swiatek said. \u201cIt was just hard to get into any rally.\u201d",
      "Sabalenka took over the top ranking from Swiatek last October and has remained there. Sabalenka is 40-6 this season with three titles and, while her three major championships all came on hard courts \u2014 at the 2023 and 2024 Australian Opens and the 2024 U.S. Open \u2014 the work she's put in to improve on clay is clearly paying off.",
      "\u201cI can go flat. I can (play) with the spin. I can go back and play in defense,\u201d Sabalenka said. \u201cThat\u2019s what works the best on the clay court for me.\u201d",
      "The truth is, regardless of the surface, Sabalenka still appears to be most comfortable when she hits the ball as hard as possible.",
      "Her high-risk style offers a contrast to Gauff, who has been making an effort to be more aggressive with her forehand but usually is at her best when she is making opponents hit shot after shot because she can get to everything with her speed, instincts and defense.",
      "\u201cShe's going to come out swinging,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cI just have to expect that and do my best to kind of counter that.\u201d",

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- The Indiana Pacers started the NBA Finals by making the wrong type of history.",
      "The Pacers committed 19 turnovers in the first half of Game 1 against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Thursday night. It was the highest number of turnovers by a team before halftime of a postseason game during the league's digital play-by-play era, which goes back to the 1997 playoffs.",
      "There has not been a 20-turnover first half in any NBA game since Nov. 17, 2007, when the New Jersey Nets \u2014 the franchise that now plays in Brooklyn \u2014 had that many in the first two quarters of what became a 91-87 loss to the Miami Heat.",
      "The Pacers had nine turnovers in the first quarter, 10 more in the second. But they were only down 57-45 at the half, in part because Oklahoma City had turned the 19 Indiana giveaways into only nine points.",
      "Oklahoma City led the NBA this season in turnovers forced, averaging 17.0 per game in the regular season.",

      "Dunne, who has more than 13 million followers on social media, created a multimillion-dollar personal brand while competing as a gymnast at LSU. Now she's trying to help other female athletes do the same, helping to educate them about name, image and likeness deals and personal branding.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to miss gymnastics so much because it has been a part of me for almost 20 years,\u201d Dunne told The Associated Press at AthleteCon, where she had a speaking engagement. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Everything. I want to do all of the things that I couldn\u2019t do while I was a gymnast\u201d because of the time constraints of being a student-athlete.",

Athletes met with representatives from social media platforms including TikTok, Snapchat and Meta, created live content and competed for NIL deals. They learned how to turn a creative idea into a brand.",

      "Advertisers took notice.",
      "She was the highest-paid female college athlete across all sports during her time with the Tigers, earning more than $4.1 million, according to On3. She worked with brands like Nautica, Crocs and Sports Illustrated, where she recently did a split on the catwalk on a \u201ctriple dare.\u201d",

The Dunnes are so innovative and they have done it with genuine intent. Livvy is the definition of NIL, in my opinion, at least true NIL and what it was meant to be from the start.\u201d",
      "Dunne said navigating the ever-changing world of NIL was like living in the wild West.",
      "\u201cI learned that you don\u2019t have to do one thing and be great at that one thing,\u201d Dunne said. \u201cYou can do multiple different things and find success in tons of different areas.\u201d",
      "But there were trying times as she balanced classes, competition and the constant demand for multiple daily social media posts.",

    "story": [
      "The Florida Panthers got outplayed for stretches of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final and ultimately lost to the Edmonton Oilers in overtime after a puck over the glass penalty",
      "EDMONTON, Alberta -- Going into this Stanley Cup Final rematch, confidence oozed from the Florida Panthers just like last year when they won \u2014 and also this time from the Edmonton Oilers because they felt prepared for the moment.",
      "After losing Game 1 in overtime after a puck over the glass penalty put Edmonton on the power play, the Panthers have not lost any of the belief they carried into the series. In a third consecutive final, the defending champions are unfazed by their deficit and appear well equipped to bounce back in Game 2 on Friday night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of battle scars on us from the last few years, and we\u2019ve been through way worse,\u201d winger Matthew Tkachuk said Thursday. \"We can be better, we can adjust a few things and come out tomorrow and try to get a win here and get some momentum going back home.\u201d",
      "A win would even things up and put the pressure right back on reigning playoff MVP Connor McDavid, Game 1-winning goal-scorer Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers with play shifting to Sunrise next week. Even a loss would not put the Panthers into desperate straits.",
      "They dropped the first two in the second round against Toronto and trailed 2-0 and 3-1 in Game 3 before rallying to win that night and beat the Maple Leafs in seven. Even for Florida's newcomers, it was evidence that this team doesn't go down easy.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re going to have moments in the game and moments in a series that you\u2019re going to be riding a roller coaster,\u201d defenseman Nate Schmidt said. \u201cThis team, I think, has an incredible ability to be able to not only learn from what they\u2019ve done and apply their experience into situations like this.\u201d",
      "Coach Paul Maurice downplayed it as \u201cjust experience,\" as though every team in the NHL or any sport knows what it is like to make this many deep playoff runs in a row and look borderline unstoppable. Because of that success, the Panthers are who they are, and not a lot of major adjustments are expected.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost always an adjustment back to form: We were a little off here, we can be a little bit better,\u201d Maurice said. \"Nobody\u2019s changing a major system. It takes months and years to do that. You\u2019re (talking about) adjustments back to form, but I think they have a pretty strong understanding of their foundation.\u201d",
      "Panthers players seem to have a pretty strong understanding of how playoff hockey works. They've won 10 of 11 playoff series since Maurice became coach and Tkachuk arrived in a trade from Calgary in the summer of 2022.",
      "The only time they've been on the wrong side of a handshake line during this stretch was the 2023 final against Vegas, when Tkachuk was sidelined by a broken sternum and several others were playing with significant injuries. The memories of that and falling behind in series along the way stick with them.",
      "\u201cWe learn more from adversity than we do from winning,\u201d forward Carter Verhaeghe said. \u201cEvery time you lose games or go through series where you\u2019re down 2-0 or losing in the Cup final a couple of years ago, you learn a lot. It\u2019s just sticking with it and being mentally strong.\u201d",
      "Tkachuk said he and his teammates are plenty strong mentally, so the tweaks will be more tactical. They won't look too different but have some areas to clean up.",
      "\u201cMaybe a little bit more offensive zone time, some things we look at, but they played a good game,\u201d defenseman Seth Jones said. \"They were solid defensively. They blocked a lot of shots. And we kind of knew that coming in there\u2019s not a lot of space out there, not a lot of plays to be made, really. So, when we do get those opportunities, try to hold on to the puck and capitalize.\u201d",
      "The Oilers turned the puck over several times in Game 1, with goaltender Stuart Skinner saving them a few times from the score getting more lopsided than the 3-1 deficit they overcame. They figure to be much improved in those areas.",
      "Coach Kris Knoblauch knows his team has to raise its level \u201cbecause we know how good Florida is.\u201d The blueprint has been out there for several years, and it's an imposing one.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re pretty confident with their identity, and they play to that identity very well,\u201d Knoblauch said. \u201cThey have a lot of confidence that they\u2019ll play their game and they should come out on top. For us, we need to just be ready for it \u2014 that they are going to be better.\u201d",

      "Carroll doubled off Iglesias, who has given up a run in eight of his last 11 appearances, and Marte followed with a run-scoring infield single. Perdomo popped up for the second out, but Ildemaro Vargas extended the game with an RBI single that cut the lead to 10-9, bringing up Su\u00e1rez.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden, you've got Geno, one of our top run producers, in the box with with tying run on base, and he comes through,\u201d Lovullo said. \u201cSo it was a magical moment for this team.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s really cool, just to see how much work and time we put in, in the cage and on the on the field, and for it to show up when it matters is really special,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cAnd it just shows how much we care and how much we want to win.\u201d",

      "Major League Baseball's one-year suspensions for betting on the sport ended for four players Thursday \u2014 San Diego starter Jay Groome, Athletics relief pitcher Michael Kelly, Philadelphia infielder Jos\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez and Arizona reliever Andrew Saalfrank.",
      "The A's announced they reinstated Kelly along with left-hander T.J. McFarland, who was on the injured list. They optioned right-handers Elvis Alvarado and Justin Sterner to Triple-A Las Vegas to make room on their big league roster.",
      "Saalfrank was optioned to the Diamondbacks' rookie-level Arizona Complex League.",
      "The Padres have not announced their plans for Groome, but the Athletic reported he was not offered a contract, making him a free agent.",
      "The Phillies have not announced their intentions regarding Rodr\u00edguez.",
      "Kelly was suspended for betting on baseball while in the minor leagues, and the other three minor leaguers were penalized for betting on big league games. Each player wagered less than $1,000. Saalfrank and Rodr\u00edguez played previously in the majors.",
      "The players violated Major League Rule 21, which is posted in every clubhouse. They were handed mandatory one-year suspensions for betting on games in which they did not participate. If they had bet on any games they attended in person \u2014 even if they didn't play \u2014 they would have been banned for life.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be U.S. surgeon general has said the nation\u2019s medical and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health",
      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d",
      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted. For example, a \u201cClean Personal & Home Care Product Recommendations\u201d guide she links to from her website contains two dozen affiliate or partner links and no disclosure that she could profit from any sales.",
      "Means has said she invested in Function Health, which provides subscription-based lab testing for $500 annually. Of the more than a dozen online posts the AP found in which Means mentioned Function Health, more than half did not disclose she had any affiliation with the company.",
      "Means also listed the supplement company Zen Basil as a company for which she was an \u201cInvestor and/or Advisor.\u201d The AP found posts on Instagram, X and on Facebook where Means promoted its products without disclosing the relationship.",
      "Though the \u201cAbout\u201d page on her website discloses an affiliation with both companies, that\u2019s not enough, experts said. She is required to disclose any material connection she has to a company anytime she promotes it.",
      "Representatives for Function Health did not return messages seeking comment through their website and executives' LinkedIn profiles. Zen Basil's founder, Shakira Niazi, did not answer questions about Means' business relationship with the company or her disclosures of it. She said the two had known each other for about four years and called Means' advice \u201ctransformational,\u201d saying her teachings reversed Niazi's prediabetes and other ailments.",
      "\u201cI am proud to sponsor her newsletter through my company,\u201d Niazi said in an email.",
      "While the disclosure requirements are rarely enforced by the FTC, Means should have been informing her readers of any connections regardless of whether she was violating any laws, said Olivier Sylvain, a Fordham Law School professor who was previously a senior adviser to the FTC chair.",
      "\u201cWhat you want in a surgeon general, presumably, is someone who you trust to talk about tobacco, about social media, about caffeinated alcoholic beverages, things that present problems in public health,\u201d Sylvain said, adding, \u201cShould there be any doubt about claims you make about products?\u201d",
      "Means isn\u2019t the first surgeon general nominee whose financial entanglements have raised eyebrows.",
      "Jerome Adams, who served as surgeon general from 2017 to 2021, filed federal disclosure forms that showed he invested in several health technology, insurance and pharmaceutical companies before taking the job \u2014 among them Pfizer, Mylan and UnitedHealth Group. He also invested in the food and drink giant Nestle.",
      "He divested those stocks when he was confirmed for the role and pledged that he and his immediate family would not acquire financial interest in certain industries regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Vivek Murthy, who served as surgeon general twice, under Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, made more than $2 million in COVID-19-related speaking and consulting fees from Carnival, Netflix, Estee Lauder and Airbnb between holding those positions. He pledged to recuse himself from matters involving those parties for a period of time.",
      "Means has not yet gone through a Senate confirmation hearing and has not yet announced the ethical commitments she will make for the role.",
      "Hund said that as influencer marketing becomes more common, it is raising more ethical questions, such as what past influencers who enter government should do to avoid the appearance of a conflict.",
      "Other administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz, have also promoted companies on social media without disclosing their financial ties.",
      "\u201cThis is like a learning moment in the evolution of our democracy,\u201d Hund said. \u201cIs this a runaway train that we just have to get on and ride, or is this something that we want to go differently?\u201d",

      "Elon Musk is threatening to decommission a capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station for NASA",
      "As President Donald Trump and Elon Musk argued on social media on Thursday, the world's richest man threatened to decommission a space capsule used to take astronauts and supplies to the International Space Station.",
      "After Trump threatened to cut government contracts given to Musk's SpaceX rocket company and his Starlink internet satellite services, Musk responded via X that SpaceX \"will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\u201d",
      "It's unclear how serious Musk's threat was. But the capsule, developed with the help of government contracts, is an important part of keeping the space station running. NASA also relies heavily on SpaceX for other programs including launching science missions and, later this decade, returning astronauts to the surface of the moon.",
      "SpaceX is the only U.S. company capable right now of transporting crews to and from the space station, using its four-person Dragon capsules.",
      "Boeing\u2019s Starliner capsule has flown astronauts only once; last year\u2019s test flight went so badly that the two NASA astronauts had to hitch a ride back to Earth via SpaceX in March, more than nine months after launching last June.",
      "Starliner remains grounded as NASA decides whether to go with another test flight with cargo, rather than a crew.",
      "SpaceX also uses a Dragon capsule for its own privately run missions. The next one of those is due to fly next week on a trip chartered by Axiom Space, a Houston company.",
      "Cargo versions of the Dragon capsule are also used to ferry food and other supplies to the orbiting lab.",
      "Russia\u2019s Soyuz capsules are the only other means of getting crews to the space station right now.",
      "The Soyuz capsules hold three people at a time. For now, each Soyuz launch carries two Russians and one NASA astronaut, and each SpaceX launch has one Russian on board under a barter system. That way, in an emergency requiring a capsule to return, there is always someone from the U.S. and Russian on board.",
      "With its first crew launch for NASA in 2020 \u2014 the first orbital flight of a crew by a private company \u2014 SpaceX enabled NASA to reduce its reliance on Russia for crew transport. The Russian flights had been costing the U.S. tens of millions of dollars per seat, for years.",
      "NASA has also used Russian spacecraft for cargo, along with U.S. contractor Northrup Grumman.",
      "The company has used its rockets to launch several science missions for NASA as well as military equipment.",
      "Last year, SpaceX also won a NASA contract to help bring the space station out of orbit when it is no longer usable.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Starship mega rocket is what NASA has picked to get astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface of the moon, at least for the first two landing missions. Starship made its ninth test flight last week from Texas, but tumbled out of control and broke apart.",

      "Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker fell sharply Thursday as investors fear his dispute with President Donald Trump could end up hurting the company",
      "Investors bought hundreds of billions of dollars of Tesla stock after Donald Trump was elected on a bet that politics were more important than profits.",
      "In three hours Thursday, they learned yet again how dangerous that gamble could be.",
      "Shares of Elon Musk\u2019s electric vehicle maker plunged more than 14% in a stunning wipeout as investors dumped holdings amid a bitter war of words between the president and the world's richest man. By the end of the trading day, $150 billion of Tesla's value had been erased, more than what it would take to buy all the shares of Starbucks and hundreds of other big publicly traded U.S. companies.",
      "In after-hours trading, Tesla shares rose 0.8%.",
      "The disagreement started over the president's budget bill, then quickly turned nasty. After Musk said that Trump wouldn't haven't gotten elected without his help, Trump implied that he may turn the federal government against his companies, including Tesla and SpaceX.",
      "\u201cThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,\u201d Trump wrote on his social messaging service Truth Social. \u201cI was always surprised that Biden didn\u2019t do it!\u201d",
      "The drop on Thursday partially reversed a big runup in the eight weeks since Musk confirmed that Tesla would be testing an autonomous, driverless \u201crobotaxi\u201d service in Austin, Texas, this month.",
      "Investors fear Trump might not be in such a rush to usher in a future of self-driving cars in the U.S., and that could slam Tesla. So much of its real business selling electric cars is struggling now and so it needs the promise of a new age of driverless cars to be realized\u2014 and fast.",
      "\u201cThe whole goal of robotaxis is to have them in 20 or 25 cities next year,\" said Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, one of Tesla's biggest fans, but now worried. \"If you start to heighten the regulatory environment, that could delay that path.\u201d",
      "He added, \"There is a fear that Trump is not going to play Mr. Nice Guy.\u201d",
      "Trump's threat to cut government contracts seems targeted more to another of Musk's businesses, SpaceX, than his car company. The privately held rocket company has received billions of dollars for sending astronauts and cargo to the International Space Station, providing launches and doing other work for NASA. The company is currently racing to develop a mega rocket for the space agency to send astronauts to moon next year.",
      "A subsidiary of SpaceX, the satellite internet company Starlink, appears to also have benefited from Musk's once-close relationship with the president.",
      "On a trip with Trump to the Middle East last month, Musk announced that Saudi Arabia had approved Starlink for aviation and maritime use. Though its not clear how much politics has played a role, a string of other recent deals in Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and elsewhere has come as Trump has threatened tariffs and sent diplomats scrambling to please the president.",
      "One measure of SpaceX's success: A private financing round followed by a private sale of shares in recent months reportedly valued it at an $350 billion, up from an estimated $210 billion a year ago.",
      "Now all that is possibly in danger. Tesla shares got even a bigger lift from Musk's close relationship with Trump, initially at least.",
      "After the presidential election in November, investors rushed into the stock, adding more than $450 billion to its value in a few weeks. The belief was that the company would see big riches as Trump eased regulatory oversight of Tesla. They also were betting that the new administration would embrace Musk's plans for millions of cars on U.S. roads without drivers behind the wheel.",
      "After hitting an all-time high on Dec. 17, the shares retreated as Musk\u2019s time as head of a government cost-cutting group led to boycotts and a hit to Tesla's reputation. They've recently popped higher again after Musk vowed to focus more on Tesla and its upcoming driverless taxi launch.",
      "Now investors aren't so sure, a worry that has translated into big paper losses in Tesla stock held by Musk personally \u2014 down $20 billion for the day.",

    "summary": "A study published in the academic journal Science has found that cutting off the horns of rhinos in Africa leads to a reduction in poaching of the endangered species",
    "story": [
      "A study published in the academic journal Science has found that cutting off the horns of rhinos in Africa leads to a reduction in poaching of the endangered species",
      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- Cutting off the horns of sedated rhinos with a chainsaw has been viewed by wildlife conservationists in Africa for more than 30 years as a necessary evil to save the iconic endangered species from poaching.",
      "They hoped the drastic action was working, but evidence was scarce.",
      "Now, a study published Thursday in the academic journal Science has found that dehorning rhinos has led to a large reduction in poaching in game reserves in and around the Kruger National Park in northern South Africa \u2014 an area that's home to 25% of the world's rhinos and is especially vulnerable to poaching.",
      "The results of the seven-year study that ended in 2023 are seen as long-awaited evidence that removing rhinos' horns \u2014 which needs to be done every one to two years because they grow back \u2014 helps them survive, even if the animals lose part of their makeup.",
      "The conclusions seem obvious. Lucrative illegal markets in parts of southeast Asia and China crave rhino horns for use in traditional medicines, and removing the rhinos' horns take away what poachers are after.",
      "But Tim Kuiper, a biodiversity scientist at South Africa's Nelson Mandela University and the lead author of the study, said it was new to have long-term data from multiple sites on dehorning rhinos. He said the study, conducted between January 2017 and December 2023, focused on 11 reserves in the Kruger area and compared data from eight that dehorned their rhinos against the three that didn't.",
      "It also analyzed data from the reserves before and after they dehorned their rhinos.",
      "The study showed that dehorning consistently reduced poaching, Kuiper said. It found that the dehorning of more than 2,000 rhinos resulted in a 78% reduction in poaching in those eight reserves, providing some confirmation that such an invasive intervention was worth it.",
      "\u201cIt is a big part of what a rhino is, having a horn,\u201d Kuiper said. \u201cSo having to remove it is kind of a necessary evil, if I can put it that way. But it\u2019s very effective. There\u2019s no doubt it saved hundreds of rhinos' lives.\u201d",
      "South Africa has the largest numbers of black and white rhinos. Namibia, Zimbabwe and Kenya also have significant populations. There are around 17,500 white rhinos and 6,500 black rhinos left in the world, with black rhino numbers reduced from 70,000 in 1970 to less than 2,500 by the time poaching reached a crisis point in the mid-1990s, according to the Save the Rhino organization.",
      "Dehorning rhinos started in southern Africa as early as 1989. It has not been accepted without question.",
      "There has been opposition from animal rights activists but also questions from conservationists over what impact it has on a rhino's wellbeing, and what a future might look like with more hornless rhinos.",
      "Vanessa Duthe, a rhino researcher in South Africa not involved in the study, said rhinos use their horns to defend themselves against predators, to compete for territory and, in the case of black rhinos, to look for food. There is also evidence that dehorned rhinos adjust their movements to live in smaller ranges, she said.",
      "She said conservationists don't know the full impacts of dehorning, but research had found it had no adverse effect on rhinos' breeding rates or mortality rates.",
      "\u201cWhat we do know is that the benefits of dehorning by far outweigh any ecological cost that we\u2019re aware of today,\u201d Duthe said. She said dehorning a rhino now takes around 10 minutes and the process causes minimum distress. Blindfolds and earmuffs are put on sedated rhinos during dehorning, which also provides an opportunity to microchip rhinos and collect samples that aid research.",
      "Conservationists agree that dehorning alone will not end rhino poaching and Kuiper said he saw it as a short-to-mid-term solution. Other efforts like more effective law enforcement and better support for game rangers on the frontline are key.",
      "While South Africa has helped pull rhinos back from the threat of extinction, more than 400 rhinos a year are still killed by poachers in the country.",
      "The dehorning study was a collaboration between scientists from three South African universities, Oxford University in England and game reserve managers and rangers. It also involved the South African National Parks department, the World Wildlife Fund and the Rhino Recovery Fund.",

      "Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body",
      "WASHINGTON -- Three decades ago, foreign students at Harvard University accounted for just 11% of the total student body. Today, they account for 26%.",
      "Like other prestigious U.S. universities, Harvard for years has been cashing in on its global cache to recruit the world\u2019s best students. Now, the booming international enrollment has left colleges vulnerable to a new line of attack from President Donald Trump. The president has begun to use his control over the nation\u2019s borders as leverage in his fight to reshape American higher education.",
      "Trump\u2019s latest salvo against Harvard uses a broad federal law to bar foreign students from entering the country to attend the campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His proclamation applies only to Harvard, and a federal judge late Thursday temporarily blocked it. But Trump's order poses a threat to other universities his administration has targeted as hotbeds of liberalism in need of reform.",
      "It\u2019s rattling campuses under federal scrutiny, including Columbia University, where foreign students make up 40% of the campus. As the Trump administration stepped up reviews of new student visas last week, a group of Columbia faculty and alumni raised concerns over Trump\u2019s gatekeeping powers.",
      "\u201cColumbia\u2019s exposure to this \u2018stroke of pen\u2019 risk is uniquely high,\u201d the Stand Columbia Society wrote in a newsletter.",
      "People from other countries made up about 6% of all college students in the U.S. in 2023, but they accounted for 27% of the eight schools in the Ivy League, according to an Associated Press analysis of Education Department data. Columbia\u2019s 40% was the largest concentration, followed by Harvard and Cornell at about 25%. Brown University had the smallest share at 20%.",
      "Other highly selective private universities have seen similar trends, including at Northeastern University and New York University, which each saw foreign enrollment double between 2013 and 2023. Growth at public universities has been more muted. Even at the 50 most selective public schools, foreign students account for about 11% of the student body.",
      "As the middle class has grown in other countries, more families have been able to afford test prep and admissions guidance to compete for spots in the Ivy League, said Rajika Bhandari, who leads a firm of higher education consultants.",
      "\u201cThe Ivy League brand is very strong overseas, especially in countries like India and China, where families are extremely brand-aware of top institutions in the U.S. and other competing countries,\u201d Bhandari said in an email.",
      "Over the last two decades, she said, U.S. universities have increasingly recognized the benefits of international exchange, seeing it as a crucial revenue source that subsidizes U.S. students and keeps enrollments up in the STEM fields of science, technology, engineering and math.",
      "America\u2019s universities have been widening their doors to foreign students for decades, but the numbers shot upward starting around 2008, as Chinese students came to U.S. universities in rising numbers.",
      "It was part of a \u201cgold rush\u201d in higher education, said William Brustein, who orchestrated the international expansion of several universities.",
      "\u201cWhether you were private or you were public, you had to be out in front in terms of being able to claim you were the most global university,\" said Brustein, who led efforts at Ohio State University and West Virginia University.",
      "The race was driven in part by economics, he said. Foreign students typically aren\u2019t eligible for financial aid and, at some schools, they pay much higher tuition than their American counterparts. Colleges also were eyeing global rankings that gave schools a boost if they recruited larger numbers of foreign students and scholars, he said.",
      "Some wealthier universities \u2014 including Harvard \u2014 offer financial aid to foreign students. But students who get into those top-tier U.S. universities often have the means to pay higher tuition rates, Brustein said. That provides further incentive to enroll more foreign students, he said, saving more scholarship money for American students.",
      "Still, international enrollment didn't expand equally across all types of colleges. Public universities often face pressure from state lawmakers to limit foreign enrollment and keep more seats open for state residents. Private universities don\u2019t face that pressure, and many aggressively recruited foreign students as their enrollment of U.S. students stayed flat. The college-going rate among American students has changed little for decades, and some have been turned off on college by rising costs and student debt loads.",
      "Proponents of international exchange say foreign students pour billions of dollars into the U.S. economy, and many go on to support the nation\u2019s tech industry and other fields in need of skilled workers. Most international students study STEM fields.",
      "In the Ivy League, most international growth has been at the graduate level, while undergraduate numbers have seen more modest increases. Foreign graduate students make up more than half the students at Harvard\u2019s government and design schools, along with five of Columbia\u2019s schools.",
      "Harvard's undergraduate foreign population increased by about 100 students from 2013 to 2023, while graduate numbers increased by nearly 2,000. Part of that growth can be explained by increasing global competition at the graduate level, said William Kirby, a historian at Harvard who has written about the evolution of higher education.",
      "\u201cIf you don\u2019t recruit the very best students internationally in your most important graduate programs, particularly in science and engineering, then you will not be competitive,\" Kirby said.",
      "The Ivy League has been able to outpace other schools in large part because of its reputation, Brustein said. He recalls trips to China and India, where he spoke with families that could recite where each Ivy League school sat in world rankings.",
      "\u201cThat was the golden calf for these families. They really thought, \u2018If we could just get into these schools, the rest of our lives would be on easy street,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Last week, Trump said he thought Harvard should cap its foreign students to about 15%.",
      "\u201cWe have people who want to go to Harvard and other schools, they can\u2019t get in because we have foreign students there,\u201d Trump said at a news conference.",
      "The university called Trump's latest action banning entry into the country to attend Harvard \u201cyet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard\u2019s First Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "In a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration\u2019s previous attempt to block international students at Harvard, the university said its foreign student population was the result of \u201ca painstaking, decades-long project\u201d to attract the most qualified international students. Losing access to student visas would immediately harm the school\u2019s mission and reputation, it said.",
      "\u201cIn our interconnected global economy,\" the school said, \u201ca university that cannot welcome students from all corners of the world is at a competitive disadvantage.\u201d",

      "It's kitten season in warm-weather areas and animal shelters need all the help they can get",
      "NEW YORK -- Strawberry, Blueberry, JoJo and Mazzy were about 6 weeks old when animal rescuers coaxed them out of long metal pipes in the parking lot of a storage unit company. Meatball was a single kitten living in a cold garage with a group of semi-feral adult cats.",
      "Spaghetti, Macaroni and Rigatoni, meanwhile, were just 2 weeks old when the good folks of LIC Feral Feeders, a cat rescue in Queens, took them in and bottle-fed them until they were strong enough to survive.",
      "Consider these cuties the face of kitten season 2025.",
      "Kitten season, typically landing during warmer months, is the time of year when most cats give birth. That produces a surge of kittens, often fragile neonates. Shelters get overwhelmed, especially when it comes to the 24-hour care and feeding of extremely young kittens.",
      "That, as a result, triggers a need for more foster homes because many of the 4,000 or so shelters in the U.S. don't have the time or resources for around-the-clock care, said Hannah Shaw, an animal welfare advocate known as the Kitten Lady with more than a million followers on Instagram.",
      "\u201cWe see about 1.5 million kittens entering shelters every year. And most of them will come into shelters during May and June,\u201d she said. \u201cShelters need all hands on deck to help out through fostering.\u201d",
      "Familiarity with fostering animals is high, Shaw said. The act of doing it is a different story. There's a false perception, she said, that the expense of fostering animals falls on the people who step up to do it. These days, many shelters and rescues cover the food, supplies and medical costs of fostering.",
      "\u201cA lot of people don\u2019t foster because they think it\u2019s going to be this huge cost, but fostering actually only costs you time and love,\u201d she said.",
      "Lisa Restine, a Hill\u2019s Pet Nutrition veterinarian, said people looking to adopt kittens should take pairs since cats often bond early in life. And how many cats is too many cats per household?",
      "\u201cThis is nothing serious or medical but my general rule of thumb is the number of adults in the house, like a 2-to-1 ratio, because you can carry one cat in each hand, so if there are two adults you can have four cats and still be sane,\u201d she said.",
      "Square footage to avoid territory disputes is a good rule of thumb when planning for cats, Restine said. Two cats per 800 square feet then 200 square feet more for each addition should help, she said.",
      "Littermates, like Macaroni and Rigatoni, are much more likely to bond, Restine said. Kittens not biologically related but raised together often bond as well \u2014 like Meatball and Spaghetti. But adopters hoping to bond an adult cat with a new kitten arrival may be disappointed.",
      "\u201cOnce they're over that 3- or 4-month mark, it's hard to get that true bonding,\u201d Restine said.",
      "Typically, kittens stay in their foster homes from a few weeks to a few months. While statistics are not kept on the number of kitten fosters that \u201cfail\u201d \u2014 when foster families decided to keep their charges \u2014 some shelters report rates as high as 90%. That's a win, despite use of the word \u201cfail,\u201d advocates note.",
      "Shaw sees another barrier holding people back from fostering: the notion that it requires special training or skills. That's why she has dedicated her life to educating the public, offering videos, books and research on how it works at her site kittenlady.org.",
      "Companies are coming on board, too. Hill's, a pet food company, runs the Hill\u2019s Food, Shelter & Love program. It has provided more than $300 million in food support to over 1,000 animal shelters that support fostering in North America.",
      "\u201cAbout a quarter of a million kittens, unfortunately, don\u2019t survive in our shelters every year,\u201d Shaw said. \u201cThe shelter\u2019s going to be there to mentor and support you. So I think a lot of the fear that people have about fostering, they might find that actually it is something you totally can do. It\u2019s just scary because you haven\u2019t done it yet.\u201d",

      "The Nintendo Switch 2 finally hit store shelves on Thursday, eight years after the initial release of Japanese video-game maker Nintendo\u2019s popular video-game console",
      "NEW YORK -- The Nintendo Switch 2 finally hit store shelves on Thursday, eight years after the initial release of Japanese video-game maker Nintendo's popular video game console.",
      "Even with a hefty $450 price tag, fans around the world, from Japan to the U.S., lined up outside stores to pick up pre-orders or have a chance to buy the device. The release ends months of anticipation that included pre-order hiccups and fears that tariffs would delay the release of the Switch 2.",
      "Here's what to know about the release and where you can buy it.",
      "The Nintendo Switch's unique ability to switch from a handheld console to a traditional one helped make it a hit when it launched in 2017. The Nintendo Switch Lite, which was a handheld-only device released two years later, also became popular, especially during the pandemic. It helped usher in bestselling Nintendo games including \u201cThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,\u201d \u201cMario Kart 8 Deluxe\u201d and \u201cAnimal Crossing: New Horizons.\u201d",
      "The Nintendo Switch 2 adds interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. It will also have a more vibrant display and a larger screen.",
      "Nintendo has sold a total of 152 million Switches, just behind its best-selling Nintendo DS console which saw 154 million units move, according to the company. But demand has dwindled for the Switch, now in its eighth year after its debut. Nintendo hopes the new console will boost its declining sales.",
      "The base Switch 2 costs $450 and a bundle with the new \u201cMario Kart World\u201d included costs $500. It can be found online and in-store at major retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy, as well as specialty retailers such as GameStop, but it is expected to be snapped up fast and widespread shortages are expected.",
      "The on-again, off-again tariffs ordered by President Trump \u2014 which included goods from Japan \u2014 sparked fears Nintendo might have to delay the device. But the launch comes within the 90-day pause on most tariffs. U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 were delayed for several weeks so the company could assess the potential impact of tariffs.",
      "When they started in April, high demand sparked a chaotic pre-order process. Scores of consumers trying to pre-order ran into delays or errors.",
      "Shoppers took to social media to share long wait times and screenshots of error messages and carts that suddenly went empty. Nintendo acknowledged the \u201cvery high demand\u201d at the time and said it was working hard to fulfill orders, but also urged people to try to buy the device without a pre-order on June 5.",
      "Nintendo said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026.",
      "The company is hoping the device jump-starts its sagging sales. In May Nintendo reported a 43% decline in profit for the fiscal year through March but promised a turnaround.",

      "A private lunar lander from Japan has crashed into the moon",
      "A private lunar lander from Japan crashed while attempting a touchdown Friday, the latest casualty in the commercial rush to the moon.",
      "The Tokyo-based company ispace declared the mission a failure several hours after communication was lost with the lander. Flight controllers scrambled to gain contact, but were met with only silence and said they were concluding the mission.",
      "Communications ceased less than two minutes before the spacecraft\u2019s scheduled landing on the moon with a mini rover. Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace.",
      "Two years ago, the company\u2019s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name \u201cResilience\u201d for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist\u2019s toy-size red house for placement on the moon\u2019s dusty surface.",
      "Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions.",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,\" Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions.",
      "A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. \"Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,\u201d the company said in a written statement.",
      "Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.",
      "Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.",
      "Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and was declared dead within hours.",
      "Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side\u2019s northern tier.",
      "Plans had called for the 7.5-foot (2.3-meter) Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.",
      "Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace\u2019s European-built rover \u2014 named Tenacious \u2014 sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.",
      "The rover, weighing just 11 pounds (5 kilograms), was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile (1 kilometer) from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight.",
      "Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch.",
      "The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.",
      "Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. \u201cEngineers did everything they possibly could\u201d to ensure success this time, he said.",
      "He considered the latest moonshot \u201cmerely a steppingstone\u201d to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement.",
      "Ispace, like other businesses, does not have \u201cinfinite funds\u201d and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month.",
      "While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it\u2019s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.",
      "Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year\u2019s end: Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic\u2019s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "For decades, governments competed to get to the moon. Only five countries have pulled off successful robotic lunar landings: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. Of those, only the U.S. has landed people on the moon: 12 NASA astronauts from 1969 through 1972.",
      "NASA expects to send four astronauts around the moon next year. That would be followed a year or more later by the first lunar landing by a crew in more than a half-century, with SpaceX's Starship providing the lift from lunar orbit all the way down to the surface. China also has moon landing plans for its own astronauts by 2030.",

      "Federal prosecutors have charged two Chinese researchers with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors charged two Chinese researchers on Tuesday with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer \u2014 charges that come amid heightened political tensions between the two countries and as the Trump administration moves to revoke visas from visiting Chinese students.",
      "Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu are charged with conspiracy, smuggling, making false statements and visa fraud for allegedly bringing the fungus Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. Jian, 33, was booked in a Detroit federal court. Liu, 34, is thought to be in China.",
      "According to the FBI, Liu had small baggies of the fungus stashed in his backpack when he flew to the U.S. last year and, after claiming ignorance about the plant material inside them, said he was planning to use it for research at a University of Michigan lab where Jian worked and where Liu previously worked.",
      "Fusarium graminearum causes a disease called Fusarium head blight that can wipe out cereal crops such as wheat, barley and maize and rice \u2014 it inflicts $1 billion in losses annually on U.S. wheat and barley crops, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "It isn\u2019t the only fungus to cause Fusarium head blight, but it\u2019s the most common culprit in the U.S. The fungus infects plants early in the growing season, shriveling wheat grains and blanching crop heads a whitish-tan color. It also causes a toxin to accumulate in wheat kernels that can make them unsafe for people and livestock to eat.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cvomitoxin\u201d because it\u2019s most known for causing livestock to throw up, it can also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and fever in animals and people.",
      "Wheat and other grain crops are screened for various toxins, including Fusarium graminearum, before they can be used to feed animals and humans. Farmers have to throw out any infected grains, which can cause devastating losses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the many problems that farmers have to deal with that risks their livelihood,\u201d said David Geiser, a Fusarium expert at Penn State.",
      "Although Jian and Liu are accused of smuggling Fusarium graminearum into the country, the fungus is already prevalent in the U.S. \u2014 particularly in the east and Upper Midwest \u2014 and scientists have been studying it for decades.",
      "Researchers often bring foreign plants, animals and even strains of fungi to the U.S. to study them, but they must file certain permits before moving anything across state or national borders.

      "When the threat of wildfires has forced power to be cut in the tourist town of Calistoga, California, on the edge of Napa Valley, it\u2019s meant firing up a bank of noisy, polluting diesel generators",
      "CALISTOGA, Calif. -- For residents of this quaint tourist town on the northern edge of Napa Valley, the threat of wildfire is seldom out of mind. The hillside bears burn scars from a 2020 fire that forced all of Calistoga to evacuate, and the 2017 Tubbs fire that killed 22 people in wine country started just a few miles from downtown.",
      "When fire danger required shutting off transmission lines that might spark a blaze, the town relied on a bank of generators in a popular recreation area that belched choking diesel exhaust and rumbled so loudly it drove people away.",
      "But now Calistoga is shifting to a first-of-its-kind system that combines two clean-energy technologies \u2014 hydrogen fuel cells and batteries \u2014 for enough juice to power the city for about two days. Experts say the technology has potential beyond simply delivering clean backup power in emergencies; they say it's a steppingstone to supporting the electric grid any day of the year.",
      "As the system was undergoing its final tests in late May in an area that includes a dog park, ball fields, community garden and bike trail, residents said they were grateful to be guaranteed clean energy year-round. Lisa Gift, a resident who also serves on the city council, noted Calistoga is already grappling with climate change that is fueling more intense and frequent wildfires.",
      "\u201cContinuing to depend on fossil fuels was simply not sustainable,\u201d Gift said. \"That's what excited me about this. It\u2019s a clean and reliable energy solution that ensures the safety and resilience of our community.\u201d",
      "Energy Vault, an energy storage company based in California, built the new facility that was to come online in early June. Next year, it could be exporting power to the electric grid whenever needed once its application to fully connect is approved.",
      "The installation sits next to where Pacific Gas & Electric used to set up nine mobile generators every year from late spring through fall. Behind a chain-link fence stand six hydrogen fuel cells standing two stories tall made by Plug Power in New York. Water vapor wafted from one of the fuel cells being tested as The Associated Press got an exclusive tour of the site as it was in final testing.",
      "Shipping containers hold two pairs of Energy Vault's lithium-ion batteries. Nearby, a cinder block wall surrounds a massive, double-walled steel tank that holds 80,000 gallons (302,833 liters) of extremely cold liquid hydrogen that gets converted to gas to run the fuel cells.",
      "California utilities, especially PG&E, have had to pay large settlements over igniting wildfires. PG&E began cutting power at times to reduce fire risk in 2018, one of California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire years. It ships diesel generators to about a dozen towns to provide backup power during those periods.",
      "Calistoga, the largest with about 5,000 people, has had its power shut off 10 times. When generators ran, they spewed exhaust with harmful nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and soot. PG&E considered replacing Calistoga's diesel generators with a natural gas version that would pollute less, but opted instead for Energy Vault's fully clean solution, said Dave Canny, the utility\u2019s vice president for the North Coast Region.",
      "Energy Vault CEO Robert Piconi said other communities, military bases and data centers could all use something similar, but potential customers wanted to see it function first.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a massive proof point with this project,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll have a lot of implications for how people think about alternative, sustainable solutions.\"",
      "The fuel cell maker, Plug Power, is planning for these types of products to be its main business in a decade. Energy Vault said it\u2019s buying clean hydrogen, produced with low or no greenhouse gas emissions, to run the fuel cells in Calistoga.",
      "\u201cThis solution is just beautiful,\" said Janice Lin, founder and president of the Green Hydrogen Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for green hydrogen projects to combat climate change. \"No noise, no emissions. And it\u2019s renewable. It\u2019s dumping diesel.\u201d",
      "Calistoga caters to tourists with a main thoroughfare that emphasizes local shops, restaurants, tasting rooms and art galleries over franchise stories. Residents pride themselves on a smalltown vibe, and say Calistoga isn't posh like much of the rest of Napa Valley.",
      "Some of those residents were concerned at first about the hydrogen, which is flammable and can be explosive. Fire Chief Jed Matcham said the \u201cvery, very large tank\u201d got his attention, too.",
      "He collaborated with Energy Vault on emergency planning and training, and said he's comfortable with the safety measures in place. Energy Vault's batteries also come with alarms, detectors and piping to extinguish a fire.",
      "The next time PG&E turns off the power to the area to prevent wildfires, it will tell Energy Vault when it\u2019s safe to electrify Calistoga. The batteries will get things back up and running, discharging the energy stored inside them to the local microgrid.",
      "Then the hydrogen fuel cells will take over to generate a steady level of power for a longer period. By working in tandem \u2014 the company likened it to the way a hybrid vehicle works \u2014 the batteries and fuel cells are expected to keep the lights on for about 48 hours or longer.",
      "Clive Richardson, who owns downtown's Calistoga Roastery and can typically be found behind the counter, drinking coffee and chatting with customers, said people in Calistoga get on edge when the winds kick up. And he knows what it's like to have to empty out his store when power goes out \u2014 a big hit for a small-business owner.",
      "A year-round clean solution for emergency power gives him a measure of comfort.",
      "\u201cThis will give us far more security than we had before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that it\u2019s come. Here we are, little ol\u2019 Calistoga, and we\u2019ve got the first-of-a-kind system that hopefully will be endorsed and go all over the world.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued the order Tuesday, blocking portions of the law from taking effect.",
      "The measure was one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. on social media use by children when Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it into law in 2024. The law would ban social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for their use by 14- and 15-year-olds.",
      "In his order granting the preliminary injunction sought by the groups Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, Walker wrote that the law is \u201clikely unconstitutional,\u201d but acknowledged that parents and lawmakers have \u201csincere concerns\u201d about social media's effects on kids.",
      "Walker wrote that the prohibition on social media platforms from allowing certain age groups to have accounts \u201cdirectly burdens those youths\u2019 rights to engage in and access speech.\u201d",
      "Also Tuesday, a federal judge in Atlanta heard arguments from NetChoice seeking to block a 2024 Georgia law scheduled to take effect July 1 that would require age verification for social media accounts and require children younger than 16 to get parental permission for accounts. Like in Florida and other states where laws have been blocked, the internet trade group NetChoice argues that the Georgia law infringes on free speech rights, is vague, and overly burdensome.",
      "While siding with the industry groups' claims that the law limits free speech, Walker allowed a provision of the Florida law to go into effect requiring platforms to shut down accounts for children under 16, if their parent or guardian requests it.",
      "Parents \u2014 and even some teens themselves \u2014 are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.",
      "Matt Schruers, the president and CEO of the industry association CCIA, praised the judge's order blocking the Florida law.",
      "\u201cThis ruling vindicates our argument that Florida\u2019s statute violates the First Amendment by blocking and restricting minors \u2014 and likely adults as well \u2014 from using certain websites to view lawful content,\" he said in a statement. \"We look forward to seeing this statute permanently blocked as a violation of Floridians\u2019 constitutional right to engage in lawful speech online.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier defended the law and the state's efforts to insulate kids from social media at a time when platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat seem almost impossible to escape.",
      "\u201cFlorida parents voted through their elected representatives for a law protecting kids from the harmful and sometimes lifelong tragic impacts of social media. These platforms do not have a constitutional right to addict kids to their products,\u201d Uthmeier's press secretary Jae Williams said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with the court\u2019s order and will immediately seek relief in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d",
      "In Atlanta, NetChoice attorney Jeremy Maltz told U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg that Georgia's law would impermissibly restrict speech by minors, saying that \u201cbefore you share your art, before you share your political information, you need to produce your papers, please.\u201d",
      "Totenberg did not rule Tuesday. But citing rulings against similar laws in other states, she expressed skepticism about Georgia's case, asking Deputy Attorney General Logan Winkles: \u201cWhat makes today different from all other days?\"",
      "Winkles argued the law's requirement of \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d attempts to verify age could be quite cheap and likened it to banning minors from bars serving alcohol, not restricting their speech.",
      "\u201cThere are things about social media that make it dangerous,\u201d Winkles said. \u201cIt's a place where children are being restricted. It's not about speech.\u201d",

      "Constellation's Clinton Clean Energy Center was actually slated to close in 2017 after years of financial losses but was saved by legislation in Illinois establishing a zero-emission credit program to support the plant into 2027. The agreement deal takes effect in June of 2027, when the state's taxpayer funded zero-emission credit program expires.",
      "With the arrival of Meta, Clinton\u2019s clean energy output will expand by 30 megawatts, preserve 1,100 local jobs and bring in $13.5 million in annual tax revenue, according to the companies. The plant currently powers the equivalent of about 800,000 U.S. homes.",

      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\u201cWhy is there a spiral there?\u201d said the museum's Jackie Faherty.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\u201d said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\u201d planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings.

      "Space weather forecasters say northern lights may be visible in parts of the northern United States following weekend solar storms",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S. Monday night following weekend solar storms.",
      "The sun burped out a huge burst of energy called a coronal mass ejection last week, prompting space weather forecasters to issue a rare, severe solar storm alert on Sunday, though it wasn't as strong as last year's record. Another one headed toward Earth on Monday could produce more aurora sightings.",
      "Authorities are monitoring for possible disruptions, though the worst is already over. The weekend\u2019s storms may have caused brief disruptions to high-frequency radio, said Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Auroras could be visible \u2014 especially in darker, rural areas \u2014 in Alaska, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine and northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Iowa, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about auroras and how to spot them.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Severe storms are capable of scrambling radio and GPS communications.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and caught telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",
      "Space weather experts aren\u2019t able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth.",
      "Northern lights forecasts can be found on NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app.",
      "Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. Experts recommend skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely.",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all.",
      "Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That\u2019s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time.",
      "\u201cAs it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,\u201d the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy.",
      "While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity.",
      "\u201cWe likely won\u2019t live to see the benefit,\" lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email.",
      "Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn\u2019t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away.",
      "Sawala\u2019s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash.",
      "Past theories put a collision between the two \u2014 resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda \u2014 as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner.",
      "For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way's movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances.",
      "Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years.",
      "\u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study,",
      "A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy's name.",
      "More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what's happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos.",
      "While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\" according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\"",

      "Such forecasts follow yearslong advances in AI-fueled chatbots, and declarations from some company executives about the onset of AI automation.",
      "Dario Amodei, CEO of Anthropic, which created an AI model called Claude, told Axios last week that technology could cut U.S. entry-level jobs by half within five years.",
      "When Business Insider laid off 21% of its staff last week, CEO Barbara Ping said the company would go \"all in on AI\" in an effort to \"scale and operate more efficiently.\"",
      "Analysts who spoke to ABC News said AI could replace or reorient entry-level jobs in some white-collar fields targeted by college graduates, such as computer programming and law.",
      "Current job woes for this cohort, they added, likely owe in part to economic conditions beyond technology. Many blue-collar and other hands-on jobs will remain largely untouched by AI, they said, noting that tech-savvy young workers may be best positioned to fill new jobs that do incorporate AI.",
      "\"We're in the flux of dramatic change,\" said Lynn Wu, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania. \"I sympathize with college graduates. In the short run, they may stay with mom and dad for a while. But in the long run, they'll be fine. They're AI natives.\"",

      "Trump brushed off the scathing criticism from Musk at the White House.",
      "Senate Republican Leader John Thune reiterated that \"failure is not an option\" as he works to get GOP holdouts on the megabill advancing President Donald Trump's legislative agenda in line -- especially amid Elon Musk's efforts to tank the bill.",
      "\"This is a team effort, and everybody is going to be rowing in the same direction to get this across the finish line. Failure is not an option, and we intend to deliver, along with the president for the American people on the things that he committed to do and that we committed to do in terms of the agenda,\" Thune told reporters after he left a meeting with Trump at the White House on Thursday.",
      "As things currently stand, Thune can afford to lose only three of his GOP members to pass the package, and right now, he has more members than that expressing serious doubts about the bill.",
      "The House-passed legislation extends the Trump 2017 tax cuts, boosts spending for the military and border security -- while making some cuts to Medicaid, SNAP and other assistance programs. It could also add $3 trillion to the deficit over the next decade, according to an analysis out Wednesday from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "As the Senate weighs possible changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap as part of the tax portion of the bill, House Republicans from blue states are already threatening to derail the bill's prospects.",
      "\"Let's be clear \u2014 no SALT, no deal,\" New York Republican Mike Lawler said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "New York Rep. Nick LaLota is on the same page, posting on X: \"No SALT. No Deal. For Real.\"",
      "The House-passed bill raises the deduction limit of state and local taxes from federal income tax filing from $10,000 to $40,000 for joint filers making less than $500,000 per year. The cap increases then by 1% every year thereafter.",
      "Thune signaled changes could be coming to the SALT deal that was struck in the House, but the details are still unclear.",
      "\"It would be very, very hard to get the Senate to vote for what the House did,\" Thune told reporters. \"We've just got some people that feel really strongly on this.\"",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson said he spoke to the SALT caucus on the floor during House votes Wednesday and plans to \"communicate\" their red line with Senate leaders.",
      "The SALT deal is \"a very delicate thing and we have to maintain the equilibrium point that we reached in the House, and it took us almost a year\u2026 so I don't think we can toss that,\" Johnson said.",
      "Musk's effect on negotiations",
      "Not helping Thune's endeavor to sway the defectors are frequent posts from Musk targeting the bill -- and on Thursday targeting the president.",
      "Musk on Thursday quoted a 2013 post from Trump criticizing Republicans for extending the debt ceiling, with Musk writing, \"Wise words.\" The two feuded on Thursday, with Trump threatening to \"terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts.\"",
      "Earlier, Musk slammed the bill, calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" and later urged all members of Congress to \"kill the bill.\"",
      "Trump touted the bill from the White House on Thursday -- brushing off the scathing criticism from Musk.",
      "\"I'm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner-workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it. All of a sudden he had a problem,\" Trump said.",
      "Johnson said he planned to speak directly to Musk on Thursday, a day after the speaker said the billionaire was \"flat wrong\" in his criticism of the bill. Multiple administration officials have attempted to reach out to Musk and his representatives personally, but their calls and texts have not been returned, several sources tell ABC News.",
      "Before speaking out publicly against the bill, Musk personally pushed some lawmakers, including Johnson, to keep the tax credits for electric vehicles in the bill, according to two people familiar with conversations.",
      "Musk criticized Johnson in a post on X on Thursday, pointing to a 2023 post where Johnson attacked the federal debt.",
      "\"Where is the Mike Johnson of 2023!?\" Musk asked.",
      "Johnson defended himself and emphasized the importance of passing the \"big, beautiful bill,\" posting that the \"Mike Johnson of 2023 is the SAME Mike Johnson who has always been a lifelong fiscal hawk - who now serves as Speaker and is implementing a multi-stage plan to get our country back to fiscal responsibility and extraordinary economic growth.\"",
      "Thune said Wednesday that although he can't speak to Musk's motivations for his opposition, he will continue to push for the bill's success in the Senate.",
      "Musk's public bashing of the bill came up in senators' meeting with Trump on Thursday, said Republican Sen. Roger Marshall, describing it as a \"laughing conversation for 30 seconds.\"",
      "\"It was very much in jest and laughing, and I think he said something positive about Elon appreciating what he did for the country,\" Marshall said.",

      "Last month, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the Trump administration to \"take all immediate steps\" to return O.C.G. after he was \"placed on a bus and sent to Mexico,\" a country where he said he was previously held for ransom and raped, according to court filings.",
      "O.C.G., according to court documents, illegally entered the U.S. in March 2024 and was deported. After he subsequently reentered the United States. O.C.G. attested during immigration proceedings that he was afraid of being sent to Mexico, leading a judge to grant him a withholding of removal to that country.",
      "Judge Murphy found that O.C.G. was likely to succeed in showing that \"his removal lacked any semblance of due process.\"",
      "\"No one has ever suggested that O.C.G. poses any sort of security threat.\" Murphy said in his order in May. \"In general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped.\"",

      "Clinton responded to recent reports alleging a decline in Biden's mental acuity.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton, on ABC's \"The View\" on Thursday, said he didn't have concerns about former President Joe Biden's mental sharpness amid a slate of reports that allege a decline in Biden's acuity during the 2024 campaign and at the end of his presidency.",
      "\"Well, I think you have to pay attention to them,\" Clinton said when asked about the accounts. \"But all I can say is whenever I was around him, his mind was clear, his judgment was good and he was on top of his brief.\"",
      "Clinton went on to question decisions made by the White House in the lead-up to the CNN debate in June 2024 between Biden and Donald Trump, including Biden's overseas travel in the days prior to his standoff with Trump on stage.",
      "\"He was 80 years old. What the heck is he doing that for?\" Clinton said. \"Why was that allowed to happen?\"",
      "\"There's a lot of questions. I don't know,\" Clinton continued. \"All I know is I think we should think less about that, more about the future.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Biden recently told ABC News in response to the release of \"Original Sin,\" a book alleging a White House cover-up of Biden reportedly declining in office, that \"there is nothing in this book that shows Joe Biden failed to do his job, as the authors have alleged, nor did they prove their allegation that there was a cover up or conspiracy.\"",
      "Speaking about President Donald Trump, Clinton criticized him for his work to \"implement that White House 2025 report that he said he never read\" -- a reference to Project 2025, a policy handbook written by the Heritage Foundation that Trump disavowed on the campaign trail.",
      "\"He said, 'Don't read that, don't pay attention to it,' but he always does that, so people pretty much knew what they were getting and get, you know, new and unprecedented actions against immigrants, legal and otherwise, and a few modest tax cut[s], but I think there's been more of what they thought they'd get on the tariffs, the taxes and the immigrants and other things,\" Clinton said. \"I think there's been more of it than they expected.\"",
      "Some of the Trump administration's actions and orders have been held up by federal courts, including actions on immigration and government cuts. Clinton said he is nervous \"that the courts won't hold until we have the midterm elections.\"",
      "He added that he feels the Supreme Court has made some good decisions, such as the court's ruling that the Trump administration's mistaken removal of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador was illegal -- though the migrant remains in jail in El Salvador.",
      "\"So I'm worried about that, and you should be worried about that, whatever your politics. \u2026 I have a sneaking suspicion if we -- if our [Democratic] Party wins the White House in the next election, there'll be a hallelujah moment, and the Supreme Court will rediscover the Constitution,\" Clinton said.",
      "Clinton was appearing jointly with novelist James Patterson to speak about their latest co-written novel, \"The First Gentleman,\" a thriller that follows the president and her husband, a former NFL star, as the first gentleman is accused of murdering his cheerleader ex-girlfriend.",

      "\"His wife is a better athlete than we are,\" Clinton added. \"Sue hit the golf ball further than any one of us.\"",
      "Later, Patterson and Clinton also criticized book bans and removals from school districts and from the White House, with Patterson bringing up how his young adult series Maximum Ride faced a book ban. The series was removed in 2023 from some school libraries in Florida.",
      "\"Sometimes, it's one person comes in, yeah, and they object. And a lot of times, they haven't read the books and they just object, and boom, it gets banned. \u2026 That's madness,\" Patterson said.",
      "Clinton criticized the removal of Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings\" from the U.S. Naval Academy's library, saying that only adults would be reading it there.",

      "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to be the next U.S. surgeon general has repeatedly said the nation\u2019s medical, health and food systems are corrupted by special interests and people out to make a profit at the expense of Americans\u2019 health.",
      "Yet as Dr. Casey Means has criticized scientists, medical schools and regulators for taking money from the food and pharmaceutical industries, she has promoted dozens of health and wellness products \u2014 including specialty basil seed supplements, a blood testing service and a prepared meal delivery service \u2014 in ways that put money in her own pocket.",
      "A review by The Associated Press found Means, who has carved out a niche in the wellness industry, set up deals with an array of businesses.",
      "In her newsletter, on her social media accounts, on her website, in her book and during podcast appearances, the entrepreneur and influencer has at times failed to disclose that she could profit or benefit in other ways from sales of products she recommends. In some cases, she promoted companies in which she was an investor or adviser without consistently disclosing the connection, the AP found.",
      "Means, 37, has said she recommends products that she has personally vetted and uses herself. She is far from the only online creator who doesn\u2019t always follow federal transparency rules that require influencers to disclose when they have a \u201cmaterial connection\u201d to a product they promote.",
      "Still, legal and ethics experts said those business entanglements raise concerns about conflicting interests for an aspiring surgeon general, a role responsible for giving Americans the best scientific information on how to improve their health.",
      "\u201cI fear that she will be cultivating her next employers and her next sponsors or business partners while in office,\u201d said Jeff Hauser, executive director of the Revolving Door Project, a progressive ethics watchdog monitoring executive branch appointees.",
      "The nomination, which comes amid a whirlwind of Trump administration actions to dismantle the government\u2019s public integrity guardrails, also has raised questions about whether Levels, a company Means co-founded that sells subscriptions for devices that continuously monitor users\u2019 glucose levels, could benefit from this administration\u2019s health guidance and policy.",
      "Though scientists debate whether continuous glucose monitors are beneficial for people without diabetes, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has promoted their use as a precursor to making certain weight-loss drugs available to patients.",
      "The aspiring presidential appointee has built her own brand in part by criticizing doctors, scientists and government officials for being \u201cbought off\u201d or \u201ccorrupt\u201d because of ties to industry.",
      "Means' use of affiliate marketing and other methods of making money from her recommendations for supplements, medical tests and other health and dietary products raise questions about the extent to which she is influenced by a different set of special interests: those of the wellness industry.",
      "Means earned her medical degree from Stanford University, but she dropped out of her residency program in Oregon in 2018, and her license to practice is inactive. She has grown her public profile in part with a compelling origin story that seeks to explain why she left her residency and conventional medicine.",
      "\u201cDuring my training as a surgeon, I saw how broken and exploitative the healthcare system is and left to focus on how to keep people out of the operating room,\u201d she wrote on her website.",
      "Means turned to alternative approaches to address what she has described as widespread metabolic dysfunction driven largely by poor nutrition and an overabundance of ultra-processed foods. She co-founded Levels, a nutrition, sleep and exercise-tracking app that can also give users insights from blood tests and continuous glucose monitors. The company charges $199 per year for an app subscription and an additional $184 per month for glucose monitors.",
      "Means has argued that the medical system is incentivized not to look at the root causes of illness but instead to maintain profits by keeping patients sick and coming back for more prescription drugs and procedures.",
      "\u201cAt the highest level of our medical institutions, there are conflicts of interest and corruption that are actually making the science that we\u2019re getting not as accurate and not as clean as we\u2019d want it,\u201d she said on Megyn Kelly's podcast last year.",
      "But even as Means decries the influence of money on science and medicine, she has made her own deals with business interests.",
      "During the same Megyn Kelly podcast, Means mentioned a frozen prepared food brand, Daily Harvest. She promoted that brand in a book she published last year. What she didn\u2019t mention in either instance: Means had a business relationship with Daily Harvest.",
      "Influencer marketing has expanded beyond the beauty, fashion and travel sectors to \u201cencompass more and more of our lives,\u201d said Emily Hund, author of \u201cThe Influencer Industry: The Quest for Authenticity on Social Media.\u201d",
      "With more than 825,000 followers on Instagram and a newsletter that she has said reached 200,000 subscribers, Means has a direct line into the social media feeds and inboxes of an audience interested in health, nutrition and wellness.",
      "Affiliate marketing, brand partnerships and similar business arrangements are growing more popular as social media becomes increasingly lucrative for influencers, especially among younger generations. Companies might provide a payment, free or discounted products or other benefits to the influencer in exchange for a post or a mention. But most consumers still don\u2019t realize that a personality recommending a product might make money if people click through and buy, said University of Minnesota professor Christopher Terry.",
      "\u201cA lot of people watch those influencers, and they take what those influencers say as gospel,\u201d said Terry, who teaches media advertising and internet law. Even his own students don\u2019t understand that influencers might stand to benefit from sales of the products they endorse, he added.",
      "Many companies, including Amazon, have affiliate marketing programs in which people with substantial social media followings can sign up to receive a percentage of sales or some other benefit when someone clicks through and buys a product using a special individualized link or code shared by the influencer.",
      "Means has used such links to promote various products sold on Amazon. Among them are books, including the one she co-wrote, \u201cGood Energy\"; a walking pad; soap; body oil; hair products; cardamom-flavored dental floss; organic jojoba oil; a razor set; reusable kitchen products; sunglasses; a sleep mask; a silk pillowcase; fitness and sleep trackers; protein powder and supplements.",
      "She also has shared links to products sold by other companies that included \u201caffiliate\u201d or \u201cpartner\u201d coding, indicating she has a business relationship with the companies. The products include an AI-powered sleep system and Daily Harvest, for which she curated a \u201cmetabolic health collection.\u201d",
      "On a \u201cMy Faves\u201d page that was taken down from her website shortly after Trump picked her, Means wrote that some links \u201care affiliate links and I make a small percentage if you buy something after clicking them.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how much money Means has earned from her affiliate marketing, partnerships and other agreements. Daily Harvest did not return messages seeking comment, and Means said she could not comment on the record during the confirmation process.",
      "Means has raised concerns that scientists, regulators and doctors are swayed by the influence of industry, oftentimes pointing to public disclosures of their connections. In January, she told the Kristin Cavallari podcast \u201cLet\u2019s Be Honest\u201d that \u201crelationships are influential.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s huge money, huge money going to fund scientists from industry,\" Means said. \"We know that when industry funds papers, it does skew outcomes.\u201d",
      "In November, on a podcast run by a beauty products brand, Primally Pure, she said it was \u201cinsanity\u201d to have people connected to the processed food industry involved in writing food guidelines, adding, \u201cWe need unbiased people writing our guidelines that aren\u2019t getting their mortgage paid by a food company.\u201d",
      "On the same podcast, she acknowledged supplement companies sponsor her newsletter, adding, \u201cI do understand how it\u2019s messy.\u201d",
      "Influencers who endorse or promote products in exchange for payment or something else of value are required by the Federal Trade Commission to make a clear and conspicuous disclosure of any business, family or personal relationship. While Means did provide disclosures about newsletter sponsors, the AP found in other cases Means did not always tell her audience when she had a connection to the companies she promoted.

      "Many LGBTQ+ travelers have expressed concerns about or decided to skip the World Pride gathering going on in Washington due to anxieties about safety, border policies and a hostile political climate",
      "WASHINGTON -- Days before she was to deliver opening remarks to World Pride\u2019s human rights conference in Washington, Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, the co-founder of UK Black Pride, said she was denied entry to the United States after her visa was revoked due to her travels to Cuba earlier this year.",
      "Opoku-Gyimah, widely known as Lady Phyll, said she applied immediately for a nonimmigrant visa. The earliest date she was given: September.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve called. I\u2019ve written. I\u2019ve pleaded,\u201d she said over a video livestream. \u201cAnd the answer was a cold, bureaucratic \u2018No.\u2019\u201d",
      "Many LGBTQ+ travelers have expressed concerns or decided to skip World Pride due to anxieties about safety, border policies and a hostile political climate. Yet cross-national strategizing has still been central to the gathering as international attendees echoed that they wanted to send a clear message of opposition to U.S. officials with their presence.",
      "\u201cThis is World Pride on Trump\u2019s doorstep,\" said Yasmin Benoit, a British model and asexual activist. \"And that\u2019s all the more reason to be here. We want to show the U.S. that there\u2019s a lot of eyes on what\u2019s happening here.\u201d",
      "World Pride gathers LGBTQ+ advocates from around the globe and has taken place most recently in Australia, Sweden and Denmark. This year, which marks the 50th anniversary of Washington's Pride festival, is the first time the city is hosting the gathering. Yet for many, the global celebration has been complicated by President Donald Trump's policies targeting transgender people and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Trump, a Republican, has said that whether a person is a man or woman is determined by that person's biological characteristics at birth, and about two-thirds of U.S. adults agree with him, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll. He has denounced DEI policies as a form of discrimination that threatens merit-based decision-making.",
      "Several countries, including Denmark, Finland and Germany, issued cautions for LGBTQ+ travelers visiting the U.S. for World Pride, culminates in a closing festival this weekend with a parade, a rally and concerts. Capital Pride Alliance, which organized World Pride D.C., included an advisory for transgender and nonbinary international travelers alongside security protocols.",
      "Egale Canada, one of the country\u2019s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, announced in February that its members would not attend any events in the U.S. through June, including World Pride. It cited concerns for transgender and nonbinary staff members.",
      "\u201cI didn't feel it was safe to have our staff crossing into the U.S. with the current hostilities, through legislation and rhetoric,\u201d said Helen Kennedy, the organization\u2019s executive director.",
      "The African Human Rights Coalition, meanwhile, called for a boycott of World Pride in Washington \u201cbecause the event is being held in a venue ... governed now by an antagonistic fascist regime which presents distinct dangers to foreign LGBTQI+ attendees,\u201d the organization said in a statement.",
      "Jessica Stern, a former U.S. special envoy for the human rights of LGBTQI+ people, acknowledged that many potential attendees decided to skip World Pride as they \u201cwonder if they\u2019ll be safe in U.S. airports and on our streets.\u201d",
      "\u201cThank you for coming to the U.S. amid a time of great uncertainty,\u201d she said in her opening remarks before an emcee later instructed attendees to shout out where they had traveled from. Answers included New Zealand, Sweden, England, Zimbabwe, Australia, Nigeria and India.",
      "As an increasing number of international travelers have expressed anxiety, John Tanzella, president of the International LGBTQ+ Travel Association, said he has assured people that Washington is an inclusive city but advised them to stay informed of local policies, connect with LGBTQ+ organizations on the ground and book with trusted businesses with track records of inclusion. The organization is working on guidance for transgender and nonbinary travelers in the U.S. for the World Pride parade and march.",
      "\u201cSafety always comes up, especially in the current climate, but there\u2019s also a deep desire to bring our community together,\u201d he said. \u201cFor many, World Pride in Washington, D.C., feels extra meaningful given its location. There\u2019s caution, yes, but above all, people want to show up, be seen and be heard.\u201d",
      "Benoit's friends had warned her not to travel to the U.S., and her anxiety was mounting in the days leading up to her flight. She planned to avoid telling customs agents she was traveling for World Pride. But when that information surfaced, she said agents took her passport and asked her questions for an additional hour about where she was staying and for how long.",
      "Still, she said, it is more important now than ever to \u201csend a message to Trump in his own backyard\" and to embrace the global nature of World Pride.",
      "\u201cThe ability to bring people together to understand how interconnected everything is, how this harmful rhetoric may bleed over to other countries, is really important,\" she said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s an opportunity to access resources and people you may not have access to back home.\u201d",
      "Essy Adhiambo, executive director of the Initiative for Equality and Non Discrimination, deleted all the social media apps on her phone before her 35-hour journey from Mombasa, Kenya, worrying that her phone might be searched. Still, Adhiambo said being visible as an international LGBTQ+ community is powerful amid threats to the community across the globe.",
      "\u201cWe must continue to protest in the current context we are in,\" she said. \"Those of us who are able to make this journey have to hold space for those who could not, especially our trans siblings. We want to amplify our message on the land of the people who are supporting homophobia.\u201d",
      "Nikki Phinyapincha, co-founder of Trans Pride Thailand, set off on a 25-hour journey to World Pride from Thailand after issuing a travel advisory from her organization for Thai LGBTQ+ people.",
      "\u201cThe political climate and instability is not new, but it makes it more important that we are here,\" she said. \"We need to keep doing this work, strategizing together and being adaptive.\u201d",
      "For people from marginalized communities, Opoku-Gyimah said, \u201cjust traveling to speak truth can often feel like a mountain.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to prove our worth at every border, every checkpoint,\u201d she said.",
      "Yet Opoku-Gyimah applauded the international nature of World Pride amid \"connected, coordinated ... and increasingly violent\" attacks against LGBTQ+ communities across the globe. She said the U.S. government\u2019s rolling back of DEI initiatives, protections for the transgender community and reproductive rights have had ripple effects abroad, including in the U.K.",
      "\u201cWhen the U.S. sneezes,\" she said, \u201cother parts of the world catch that cold.\u201d",

      "SAN DIEGO -- A jury in California on Thursday awarded more than $3 million in damages to a former Orange County prosecutor who alleged the county's district attorney targeted her and forced her out of her position after she tried to protect women in the office from retaliation for accusing a supervisor of sexual harassment.",
      "The verdict marks the end of a two-week trial in San Diego in which former district attorney supervisor Tracy Miller accused Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer and former Chief Assistant District Attorney Shawn Nelson of a laundry list of misconduct that she said the county did not reasonably respond to, the Orange County Register reported.",
      "\u201cShe was thrilled the jury came back and recognized what happened to her,\u201d said Miller\u2019s attorney Bijan Darvish. \u201cBut also reliving everything brings back some of the emotional feelings she was feeling at the time.\u201d",
      "The penalties awarded were for the former high-ranking prosecutor's future economic loss and emotional distress.",

      "Spitzer said in a statement that he respects the jury\u2019s decision but that when he became district attorney in 2019, he \u201cinherited an office in chaos\u201d and did the best he could given the many overwhelming issues they were facing.",
      "\u201cI am heartbroken over the fact that any of my actions could have been interpreted as anything other than a good faith effort to clean up the public corruption in the Orange County District Attorney\u2019s Office and to create a work ethic that adheres to what Orange County residents demand of its District Attorney,\u201d he said.",
      "Miller accused Spitzer and Nelson of humiliating her, using \u201cgender-based slurs,\u201d disrespecting her and undermining her authority.",
      "She said the situation became especially contentious after she cooperated with the investigator looking into sexual harassment allegations against then-district attorney supervisor Gary Logalbo in 2020. She accused Nelson of speaking badly about the women who spoke out. She also said Spitzer attempted to get one of the women written up for accusing Logalbo, who was the best man at Spitzer\u2019s wedding.",

      "A federal judge has ruled that two federal agencies cannot punish Catholic employers and health care providers if they refuse, for religious reasons, to provide gender-affirming care to transgender patients or won\u2019t provide health insurance coverage fo...",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Two federal agencies cannot punish Catholic employers and health care providers if they refuse for religious reasons to provide gender-affirming care to transgender patients or won't provide health insurance coverage for such care to their workers, a federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "The ruling from U.S. District Judge Peter Welte, the chief federal judge in North Dakota, bars the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from enforcing a health care rule it imposed in 2024 under Democratic President Joe Biden. The rule said that existing policies against sex discrimination covered discrimination based on gender identity, so that health care providers risked losing federal funds if they refused to provide gender-affirming care.",
      "Welte also barred the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from telling employers that a failure to have health plans cover gender-affirming care for their workers would represent discrimination based on sex that could lead to a lawsuit against them and penalties.",
      "The judge rejected a request from an order of nuns, two Catholic homes and the Catholic Benefits Association, which represents employers, to impose similar bans on each agency covering abortion and fertility treatments Catholic organizations consider immoral. He said those claims were \u201cunderdeveloped\u201d and not ready for court review.",
      "But he concluded that allowing the two agencies to enforce policies on gender-affirming care or health coverage for it would restrict employers' and health care providers' ability to live out their religious beliefs, violating a 1992 federal law meant to provide broad protections for religious freedoms. The HHS rule had a provision allowing the agency to make case-by-case exceptions based on religious beliefs, but Welte said that would be insufficient.",
      "\u201cThe case-by-case exemption procedure leaves religious organizations unable to predict their legal exposure without furthering any compelling antidiscrimination interests,\u201d wrote Welte, who is based in Fargo.",
      "The two agencies did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment Thursday.",
      "The Catholic Benefits Association serves more than 9,000 employers and about 164,000 employees enrolled in member health plans, according to its website.",
      "The group, founded in 2013, says it \u201cadvocates for and litigates in defense of our members\u2019 First Amendment rights to provide employee benefits and a work environment that is consistent with the Catholic faith.\u201d The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects religious freedoms.",
      "Association General Counsel Martin Nussbaum welcomed the ruling, saying the organization\u2019s members \u201cwant to do the right thing in their health plan and in their medical services that they provide for those medical providers, and this gives them protection to doing that.\u201d",
      "And he said the judge's ruling suggests there are no mandates from the federal government on abortion or fertility treatments, so there is \u201cno need to provide protection.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2020 that the Civil Rights Act's protections against discrimination based on sex also cover anti-LGBTQ+ bias in employment. The landmark 1964 act doesn't have specific provisions dealing with bias based on sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "But courts also have intervened to limit how far the federal government can go in combating anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination when religious organizations or employers with religious beliefs against LGBTQ+ rights are involved.",
      "Both the HHS rule and the EEOC's policy on sex discrimination have their roots in efforts by President Barack Obama to protect LGBTQ+ rights in 2016, in his last year in office.",
      "When President Donald Trump began his second term in January, he issued an order saying the federal government would not recognize transgender people's gender identities. In April, two employees said the EEOC was classifying all new gender identity-related discrimination cases as its lowest priority, essentially putting them on indefinite hold.",
      "The 2024 HHS rule also covered bias based on \u201dpregnancy or related conditions,\" and the Catholic health care providers argued that they might face losing federal funds if they refused to perform abortions, in line with Catholic opposition to abortion. But HHS said the rule wouldn't have forced them to perform abortions or provide health coverage for abortions \u2014 only that it couldn't refuse to care for someone because they'd had one, according to Welte.",

      "Proponents say the measures give those accused of ethics violations more opportunities to respond to allegations, increases transparency and limits abuses of a process they claim is often unjust. But watchdog groups \u2014 and the Board of Ethics \u2014 warn the changes will undermine the board's ability to hold public officials accountable.",
      "While the changes would not apply to Landry\u2019s current charges, the legislation further bolsters the governor\u2019s power over a state board largely made up of his own appointees. Having overwhelmingly passed in the House and Senate this week \u2014 only three lawmakers voted against it \u2014 the bill awaits Landry's signature.",
      "Republican Rep. Gerald \u201cBeau\u201d Beaullieu, who sponsored the bill, said it was brought forth after officials complained that the board's investigation process was \u201cmore like being investigated by the Gestapo.\u201d",
      "Landry\u2019s office declined to comment.",
      "Another bill would share the names of complainants with officials they are accusing of wrongdoing, as well as limit the board's ability to launch investigations.",
      "Landry\u2019s private attorney, Stephen Gel\u00e9, drafted the legislation, which the governor supports.",
      "Gel\u00e9 is defending Landry against ethics charges brought in 2023 for undisclosed free plane rides to Hawaii when he served as the state's attorney general. Gel\u00e9 said negotiations are progressing to \u201camicably resolve the charges.\u201d",
      "Last year, Gel\u00e9 warned lawmakers that the ethics board\u2019s investigatory powers are \u201cdangerous, unwarranted, and threaten well-established fundamental constitutional rights\" and he has sought to rein them in with new legislation.",
      "The bill's supporters say it gives the board more discretion about whether to pursue investigations and bring charges, cuts down on waste of taxpayer dollars and strengthens due process rights for the accused.",
      "Yet these changes are raising red flags.",
      "In a letter to lawmakers, the Board of Ethics warned that the bill\u2019s requirement to share copies of all subpoenas with officials under investigation allows them to \u201cinfluence a witness\u2019s documents or responses.\u201d",
      "Critics say the bill undercuts the board's authority by granting local courts the power to quash investigations, gives officials opportunities to run out the clock on the board's one-year timeline to bring charges and prevents the board from investigating violations that were disclosed by public officials seeking the board\u2019s advisory opinion.",
      "The bill also requires a two-thirds board vote to approve an investigation into a sworn complaint and another two-thirds vote on whether to file charges. Current policy requires only majority votes.",
      "Barry Erwin, president of the Council for a Better Louisiana, a nonpartisan government accountability group, said the bill's two-thirds vote requirements constitute a \u201chigh bar to overcome\u201d for a board of political appointees.",
      "\u201cI just think in real life, in very political situations, it\u2019s hard for some of these board members to act with the independence in the system we had before,\u201d Erwin said.",
      "The other bill under consideration \u2014 which Gel\u00e9 said he did not craft and Landry has not publicly supported \u2014 would require anyone bringing an ethics complaint to disclose their name and file the complaint in person at the ethics board offices in Baton Rouge. The bill passed in the House with only seven lawmakers opposed and is pending final passage in the Senate.",
      "In a legislative committee hearing, David Bordelon, general counsel for the ethics board, warned that the bill would enable officials \u201cto intimidate a witness or potentially alter information that's requested.\u201d Bordelon said the measure would \u201cdrastically reduce the number of complaints.\"",
      "The legislation's sponsor, Republican Rep. Kellee Hennessey Dickerson, said her bill is part of a fight for \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cjustice.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor those of us who have been through it, it helps develop peace of mind, knowing who your accuser is, especially when you are spending thousands upon thousands of dollars to try and clear your good name,\u201d said Dickerson, who was fined $1,500 for an ethics violation in 2023.",
      "She argued people frequently file complaints to harass their political opponents. Bordelon countered that the board dispassionately evaluates complaints and provides the accused with the opportunity to defend themselves if charges are brought.",
      "The bill also prevents the ethics board from launching investigations based on non-governmental sources such as media reports.",
      "Following legislation passed last year, the governor directly appoints nine of the board's 15 members, with the Legislature appointing the rest.",
      "Officials with the legislative and executive branches now have more control over those who may be tasked with investigating them, watchdogs note.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gone from a process that was as much arm's length away from politics as we could make it, and we had it that way for many years, to a process now that is very much more political than we've ever seen it,\" Erwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very difficult for the board to act in a way that guarantees that kind of oversight we want to have.\u201d",

      "EL PASO, Texas -- A Peruvian woman who crossed the U.S. border illegally was acquitted Thursday of unauthorized access to a newly designated militarized zone in the first trial under the Trump administration's efforts to prosecute immigrants who cross in certain parts of New Mexico and western Texas.",
      "Adely Vanessa De La Cruz-Alvarez, 21, was arrested last month near the West Texas town of Tornillo after she entered the U.S. from Mexico by walking across the riverbed of the Rio Grande, court documents show.",
      "In addition to being charged with entering the country illegally, she was charged with accessing a military zone. She is among several other immigrants who have been charged under the law since President Donald Trump\u2019s administration transferred oversight of a strip of land along the border to the military. It is as part of a new approach the Department of Justice is taking to crack down on illegal immigration.",
      "The Associated Press left messages Thursday with De La Cruz-Alvarez's attorney, Veronica Teresa Lerma. The lawyer told The Texas Tribune the acquittal is significant.",
      "\u201cHopefully, this sets the tone for the federal government,\u201d Lerma said, \u201cso they know what the El Paso community will do with these charges.\u201d",
      "Even before the woman's case went to trial, federal magistrate judges in neighboring New Mexico had dismissed similar cases, finding little evidence that immigrants knew about the zones.",
      "Lerma was convicted of entering the country illegally and was already facing deportation, but could have faced up to 18 months in prison for entering the militarized zone.",
      "Despite the verdict, U.S. Attorney Justin Simmons of the Western District of Texas said his office will continue to aggressively prosecute National Defense Area violations.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, another illegal alien has been found guilty of illegally entering the country in violation of the improper entry statute and will be removed from the United States,\u201d Simmons said in a statement. \"That\u2019s a win for America.\"",
      "The administration wants to sharply increase the removal of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally as Trump seeks to make good on his pledge of mass deportations. The administration has deployed thousands of troops to the border, while arrests have plunged to the lowest levels since the mid-1960s.",

      "President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into pardons and other executive actions issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden \u2014 launching an unprecedented effort to show that the Democrat hid his cognitive decline and was otherwise too mentally imp...",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into pardons and other executive actions issued by his predecessor, Joe Biden \u2014 launching an extraordinary effort to show that the Democrat hid his cognitive decline and was otherwise too mentally impaired to do the job.",
      "Trump, who turns 79 this month, has long questioned the mental acuity and physical stamina of Biden, and is now directing his administration to use governmental investigative powers to try and back up those assertions. Biden, 82, and now undergoing treatment for prostate cancer, dismissed Trump's actions as \u201cridiculous.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at what Trump is alleging, what impact it could have, and why the country may never have seen anything like this before.",
      "Trump directed his White House counsel and attorney general to begin an investigation into his own allegations that Biden aides hid from the public declining mental acuity in their boss. Trump is also casting doubts on the legitimacy of the Biden White House's use of the autopen to sign pardons and other documents.",
      "It marks a significant escalation in Trump\u2019s targeting of political adversaries, and could lay the groundwork for arguments by leading Republicans in Congress and around the country that a range of Biden\u2019s actions as president were invalid.",
      "\u201cEssentially, whoever used the autopen was the president,\u201d Trump said Thursday.",
      "He then went further, suggesting that rogue elements within the Biden administration might have effectively faked the president's signature and governed without his knowledge \u2014 especially when it came to pushing policies that appeased the Democratic Party's far-left wing.",
      "\u201cHe didn\u2019t have much of an idea what was going on,\u201d Trump said, though he also acknowledged that he had no evidence to back up those assertions. A Trump fundraising email released a short time later carried the heading, \u201cA robot ran the country?\u201d",
      "Legal experts are skeptical about that the investigation will do much more than fire up Trump's core supporters.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s more of a political act than one that will have any legal effect,\u201d said Richard Pildes, a constitutional law scholar at New York University School of Law. He added: \u201cI think it\u2019s designed to continue to fuel a narrative that the administration wants to elevate, but courts are not going to second-guess these sorts of executive actions\u201d undertaken by Biden.",
      "Trump has long questioned the legitimacy of pardons his predecessor issued for his family members and other administration officials just before leaving office on Jan. 20, people whom Biden was worried could be targeted by a Trump-led Justice Department.",
      "But Trump has more recently suggested Biden was unaware of immigration policies during his own administration, and said Thursday that aides to his predecessor pushed social issues like transgender rights in ways Biden might not have agreed with.",
      "It is well-established that a president\u2019s executive orders can easily be repealed by a successor issuing new executive actions \u2014 something Trump has done repeatedly since retaking the White House. That lets Trump wipe out Biden administration policies without having to prove any were undertaken without Biden's knowledge \u2014 though his predecessor's pardons and judicial appointments can't be so easily erased.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to completed legal acts like pardons or appointing judges,\u201d Pildes said, a later president \u201chas no power to overturn those actions.\u201d",
      "Autopens are writing tools that allow a person\u2019s signature to be affixed automatically to documents. The Justice Department, under Democratic and Republican administrations, has recognized the use of an autopen by presidents to sign legislation and issue pardons for decades \u2014 and even Trump himself acknowledges using it.",
      "\u201cAutopens to me are used when thousands of letters come in from young people all over the country and you want to get them back,\u201d Trump said Thursday.",
      "Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt said the \u201cconsensus view is that, as long as the president has directed the use of the autopen in that particular instance, it is valid.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe only issue would be if someone else directed the use of the autopen without the President\u2019s approval,\u201d Kalt, an expert on pardons, wrote in an email.",
      "Yes. Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution bestows the president with the power \u201cto grant Reprieves and Pardons.\u201d",
      "\u201cA president\u2019s pardons cannot be revoked. If they could, no pardon would ever be final,\u201d American University politics professor Jeffrey Crouch, author of a book on presidential pardons, said in an email. \u201cThere is no legal obstacle I am aware of to a president using an autopen on a pardon.\u201d",
      "Kent Greenfield, a Boston College law professor, said, \u201cOnce you pardon somebody, you can\u2019t go back and un-pardon them.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s done with a president\u2019s authority, I don\u2019t think it matters whether it\u2019s done with an autopen or not,\u201d Greenfield added. \u201cThe president\u2019s authority is the president\u2019s authority.\u201d",
      "Trump's suggestions that Biden's administration effectively functioned without his knowledge on key policy matters go beyond questions about pardons and the president using the autopen. Even there, though, the Supreme Court ruled in 2024 that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution. At the time, Trump celebrated the ruling as a \u201cBIG WIN\u201d because it extended the delay in the Washington criminal case against him on charges he plotted to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
      "Such immunity would likely cover Biden as a former president. It might not extend to Biden administration officials allegedly acting without his knowledge \u2014 though Trump himself acknowledged he's not seen evidence of that occurring.",
      "Biden has dismissed Trump's investigation as \u201cnothing more than a mere distraction.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn\u2019t is ridiculous and false,\u201d he said in a statement.",
      "In a word, no.",
      "There have been allegations of presidents being impaired and having their administrations controlled by intermediaries more than the public knew \u2014 including Edith Wilson, who effectively managed access to her husband, Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, after his serious stroke in 1919. Wilson's critics grumbled about a shadow presidency controlled by his wife, but the matter was never formally investigated by Congress, nor was it a major source of criticism for Wilson's Republican successor, Warren G. Harding.",
      "More recently, some questioned whether President John F. Kennedy struggled more than was publicly known at the time with Addison\u2019s Disease and debilitating back pains while in office. And there were questions about whether dementia might have affected Ronald Reagan during his second term, before he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1994, five years after he left office.",
      "Trump himself was indicted four times, and convicted once, while Biden was in office \u2014 but those investigations were not ordered by Biden.",

The crew will assess the ship's condition, and a separate tug with firefighting and ocean towage capabilities is being arranged, the company said in its statement. In the meantime, officials are using the ship's onboard satellite-connected systems to monitor it.",
      "The vessel remained afloat as of Thursday morning, and images gathered by the U.S. Coast Guard showed it was still \u201calight with smoke emanating\u201d from it, the statement said.",
      "The Coast Guard has said it received a distress alert around 3:15 p.m. Tuesday about a fire aboard the Morning Midas, which was roughly 300 miles (490 kilometers) southwest of Adak Island. The ship was carrying about 70 fully electric and about 680 hybrid vehicles, the Coast Guard said, noting that the information was preliminary.",
      "Adak is about 1,200 miles (1,930 kilometers) west of Anchorage, Alaska\u2019s largest city.",
      "All 22 Morning Midas crew members were uninjured. They were evacuated onto a lifeboat and a nearby merchant vessel rescued them. They remained onboard the rescue vessel Thursday, according to Zodiac Maritime.",
      "The 600-foot (183-meter) Morning Midas was built in 2006 and sails under a Liberian flag. The car and truck carrier left Yantai, China, on May 26, according to the industry site marinetraffic.com. It was headed to a major Pacific port in Mexico.",
      "A Dutch safety board in a recent report called for improving emergency response on North Sea shipping routes after a deadly 2023 fire aboard a freighter that was carrying 3,000 automobiles, including nearly 500 electric vehicles, from Germany to Singapore.",
      "One person was killed and others injured in the fire, which burned out of control for a week. That ship was eventually towed to a Netherlands port for salvage.",

      "MIAMI -- A shark-diving charter boat captain convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a giant grouper from a fisherman\u2019s longline off the coast of Florida says he's felt like he was living in an alternate universe for the past five years. That changed last week when he received a presidential pardon.",
      "\u201cThis is something I never thought I\u2019d hold,\u201d John Moore Jr. said Tuesday, as he showed off the document with U.S. President Donald Trump's signature scrawled across the bottom.",
      "Moore and crew member Tanner Mansell were convicted in 2022 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction. The two men avoided prison time but were ordered to pay $3,343.72 in restitution. The felony convictions prevented them from voting in Florida, owning firearms or traveling freely outside the U.S.",
      "Moore said he and his attorneys were surprised by the pardon, because they hadn't petitioned for one.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t reach out to the White House,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe never approached them for a pardon, because that was kind of skipping steps, like we had actually filed the paperwork to take this to the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Moore and Mansell spotted the longline about 3 miles (5 kilometers) off the Jupiter Inlet in August 2020, according to court records. Believing it was an illegal fishing line, the men freed the sharks and a grouper, reported it to state wildlife officials and brought the line back to shore.",
      "Federal prosecutors later charged the men with theft. Officials said the line belonged to a fisherman licensed by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration to catch sharks for research.",
      "Mansell and Moore were convicted by a jury, and their appeals were later denied. The full and unconditional pardons signed by Trump erase those convictions.",
      "\u201cWould I have done something different, now that I know that that was a legal line?\u201d Moore asked. \u201cI was a commercial fisherman. I would never touch a legal line. But now I know more about this, that those things can exist.\u201d",

      "HOUSTON -- Investigators are looking into whether the sexual orientation of \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d voice actor Jonathan Joss played a role in his shooting death in Texas, authorities said Thursday, walking back a previous statement about the potential motive.",
      "Joss\u2019 husband has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled \u201cviolent homophobic slurs\u201d before opening fire outside his home in San Antonio on Sunday night. A day after the shooting, San Antonio police issued a statement saying they had found \u201cno evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr. Joss\u2019 murder was related to his sexual orientation.\u201d",

      "\u201cI will own that and simply say again that we simply shouldn\u2019t have done that. It was way too early in the process for any statement of that nature to be issued,\u201d McManus said.",

      "\u201cThe loss of Jonathan Joss was tragic, most heavily felt by the LGBTQ+ community,\u201d McManus said.",
      "Texas does not have separate hate crimes charges. But if homophobia is found to have been a motive in the shooting, that could result in a harsher sentence at trial under the state's hate crimes law.",
      "\u201cWe gather the facts, and we give those facts to the district attorney\u2019s office. And then that hate crime designation is determined at sentencing,\u201d McManus said.",
      "The actor's home burned down in January. Joss\u2019 husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, has said that they were checking mail there Sunday when a man approached them, pulled out a gun and opened fire.",
      "In a statement, de Gonzales said he and Joss had previously faced harassment, much of it \u201copenly homophobic.\u201d",
      "Sigfredo Ceja Alvarez, who is a neighbor of Joss, is charged with murder in the shooting. Ceja Alvarez has been released on a $200,000 bond.",
      "Ceja Alvarez\u2019s attorney, Alfonso Otero, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Thursday.",
      "McManus said police had been called to Joss\u2019 home and his neighborhood about 70 times over the past two years related to \u201cneighborhood type disturbances.\u201d",
      "\u201cSometimes (Joss) was the caller. Other times, the neighbors were calling on him,\u201d McManus said.",

      "NEWTON, N.C. -- A North Carolina judge ordered Thursday that a defendant accused in last weekend's shootings at a house party that left one person dead and 11 others injured stay in jail while awaiting trial.",
      "The decision came the day after another judge had set a $200,000 bond for Garon Nathaniel Killian, 20, of Lenoir, who is charged with one count of attempted first-degree murder related to the shootings. Prosecutors on Wednesday had asked that no bond be allowed.",
      "Killian had not posted the amount to be released. On Thursday, when Killian had a court date for charges involving a different altercation in April, District Court Judge Scott Conrad revoked the $200,000 bond related to last weekend's violent fracas, according to the Catawba County Clerk of Court's office.",
      "Investigators of the shootings that happened early Sunday believe at least 80 shots were fired in a crime scene that spanned several properties along a road in the usually quiet residential neighborhood. FBI agents spent this week at the scene examining bullet trajectories.",
      "The Catawba County Sheriff's Office has said that beyond Killian three people have been arrested and charged with crimes related to the party or shootings, and that authorities were seeking on Thursday two other men also wanted on attempted first-degree murder.",
      "Giving Killian on Wednesday the chance to post bond had angered local law enforcement leaders. Hickory city police announced previously that Killian and another young man had been charged with many counts \u2014 including attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill \u2014 for an April 6 altercation in a parking lot that led to shots being fired into a crowd. No one was injured.",
      "Catawba Sheriff Don Brown said on Wednesday at a media briefing that while Killian was freed by posting bond several days later he \u201cshould have never went back on the street,\" and called the situation \u201cfrustrating\u201d and \u201cinfuriating.\u201d",

      "Two of the other three people arrested were charged with three counts of helping someone underage 21 by allowing the possession of alcoholic beverages. The charges are related to the planning and promotion of the house party, the sheriff\u2019s office said.",
      "There were many juvenile or underage attendees, the state Division of Alcohol Law Enforcement said Wednesday. The other person arrested was charged as an accessory to attempted first-degree murder after the fact, the sheriff's office said.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- A corrections officer on Wednesday agreed to plead guilty to federal charges in the case of a mentally ill man who froze to death in an Alabama jail.",
      "Braxton Kee is the 14th employee who has been indicted or pleaded guilty to contributing to the death of Tony Mitchell, 33, who died after being incarcerated in the Walker County jail in January 2023. Kee's plea agreement, like many other deals that were filed before his, said that a culture of retaliation made him afraid to report Mitchell's deadly conditions.",

      "Mitchell was arrested on Jan. 12 after a relative asked for a welfare check on him. The sheriff\u2019s office said at the time that Mitchell was talking about portals to hell and asserted that he had fired a weapon at officers. When he arrived at the jail, Mitchell was disoriented, had trouble standing and walking, prosecutors wrote in the plea agreement.",
      "The jail had a nurse and a mental health professional staffed throughout Mitchell's period of incarceration.",
      "Mitchell was held in a concrete cell sometimes referred to as the jail\u2019s \u201cdrunk tank,\u201d with no bedding, bathroom or running water. Previous court documents described Mitchell as \u201calmost always naked, wet, cold, and covered in feces while lying on the cement floor without a mat or blanket.\u201d",
      "Kee worked 10 of the 14 nights that Mitchell was held at the jail. On numerous occasions, Kee raised concerns about Mitchell's conditions to colleagues, the jail's medical staff and supervisors, the plea deal said. Kee's concerns were also brought to the attention of the jail's captain.",
      "Mitchell's conditions remained unchanged.",
      "At one point, Kee repeatedly kicked Mitchell's arm as he \u201clay naked and barely moving on the floor for several minutes\" so that a lieutenant could drag Mitchell back into \u201cthe cruel and inhumane conditions\u201d in his cell, officials said.",
      "Eventually, two weeks after he was arrested, Mitchell became mostly unresponsive to officers. Kee told the nurse on shift that she should call an ambulance but she insisted that they wait until the lieutenant arrive \u2014 even though she had called an ambulence earlier in the shift for another inmate without the lieutenant's permission.",
      "The lieutenant, Benjamin Shoemaker, agreed to plead guilty in January to contributing to Mitchell's death. In Shoemaker's plea, he said he was instructed to manufacture terrible conditions to use Mitchell \u201cand his cell as a prop\u201d when a county commissioner visited the jail two days before Mitchell died.",

      "Zohran Mamdani has buzz and some momentum in New York City\u2019s mayoral race",
      "NEW YORK -- Zohran Mamdani has buzz and some momentum in New York City's mayoral race. But can a 33-year-old democratic socialist \u2014 or anyone else \u2014 beat former Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary?",
      "Mamdani picked up a key endorsement Thursday from U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who said in a statement that the state lawmaker \u201chas demonstrated a real ability on the ground to put together a coalition of working-class New Yorkers that is strongest to lead the pack.\u201d",
      "The endorsement, made the day after the first Democratic debate of the campaign, is likely to help solidify Mamdani's standing as a liberal darling in the contest, now in its final three weeks.",
      "It remains to be seen whether it will help him overcome Cuomo, whose campaign juggernaut has won the backing of some of the cities biggest unions as he attempts a comeback from the sexual harassment scandal that ended his reign as governor in 2021.",
      "Mamdani's laser-focus on lowering the cost of living in one of the world's most expensive cities has helped him climb from relative obscurity to become one of the race's leading figures. His criticisms of Israel, socialist label, and relative lack of experience could hurt him, though, with centrists.",
      "Mamdani, who would be the city's first Muslim and Indian American mayor, was born in Kampala, Uganda, before he and his family moved to New York City when he was 7. He became naturalized as an American citizen a few years after graduating from college, where he co-started his school's first Students for Justice in Palestine chapter. His mother, Mira Nair, is an award-winning filmmaker. His father, Mahmood Mamdani, is an anthropology professor at Columbia University.",
      "Zohran Mamdani was elected to the state Assembly in 2020, representing a district in Queens. His most-known legislative accomplishment was pushing through a pilot program that made a handful of city buses free for a year.",
      "His mayoral campaign has been full of big promises \u2014 free child care, free buses, a rent freeze for people living in rent-regulated apartments, new affordable housing and raising taxes on the wealthy \u2014 all packaged in well-produced social media videos.",
      "Critics say his hopeful visions get blurry when it comes to detail, and have also questioned the cost and feasibility of his proposals, many of which would need support from the state Legislature and governor.",
      "Cuomo, during Wednesday night's debate, took aim at Mamdani's relative inexperience, saying the state Assembly member has a good online presence but actually \u201cproduces nothing,\u201d adding \"He\u2019s been in government 27 minutes. He\u2019s passed three bills. That\u2019s all he\u2019s done.\u201d",
      "Some Jewish voters, an important voting bloc, might be turned off by Mamdani\u2019s support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and his use of the term \u201cgenocide\u201d to describe Israel's war on Gaza.",
      "Mamdani has also vowed to have Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrested if he came to the city. The International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Netanyahu last year, saying he had committed war crimes by using starvation as a weapon during Israel's military campaign in Gaza.",
      "Pressed during the debate on whether he thought Israel has a right to exist as a Jewish state, Mamdani said \u201cI believe Israel has the right to exist,\u201d but \u201cas a state with equal rights\u201d for people who aren\u2019t Jewish.",
      "As the June 24 primary approaches, Mamdani appears aware of another issue he and every other candidate not named Cuomo is having: name recognition.",
      "Mamdani, in a recent social media video, noted that \"a third of New Yorkers still haven\u2019t heard of us,\" though he framed that as a positive, indicating he still has room to grow.",
      "At a recent election rally in Manhattan, Maria Walles, a 54-year-old Bronx voter, said she didn't like Cuomo or Eric Adams, the incumbent mayor who faced federal corruption charges, then decided to skip the Democratic primary and run as an independent after President Donald Trump's Justice Department abandoned that prosecution.",
      "But Walles said she wasn't quite sure about the alternative candidates.",
      "\u201cZo ...,\" she said, grasping for Mamdani's name when asked about the candidate field.",
      "As it turns out, Mamdani was at the rally, which was organized by a tenant advocacy group, and received a standing ovation for his speech.",
      "To win, Mamdani will need to expand his support beyond the city's young, progressive crowd to the more moderate voters who have been a critical factor in past elections.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, Mamdani said if you speak to the people directly about issues they care about, such as the sky-high cost of living, you can successfully build a coalition, regardless of \"what we have been told is the politics that can succeed in this city and the ways in which we have been told how to run a campaign and who we actually have to speak to.\u201d",
      "\u201cOften times people try to characterize New York City politics through the lens of political constituencies that they define as hard and fast. And in reality there is no ideological majority in New York City,\" he said.",

      "The U.N. food agency is appealing for $46 million for the next six months to help about 2 million Haitians in dire need of food, including 8,500 at the worst catastrophic level of hunger",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. food agency is appealing for $46 million for the next six months to help about 2 million Haitians in dire need of food, including 8,500 at the worst catastrophic level of hunger.",
      "The appeal was issued by Lola Castro, the World Food Program\u2019s regional director for Latin America and the Caribbean, who recently returned from Haiti, where escalating gang violence has displaced well over 1 million people and left half the population \u2014 5.7 million people \u2014 in urgent need of food.",
      "Two million of them are in the two worst categories in the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the leading international authority on hunger crises, and 8,500 are in the worst Phase 5 category, she said. That means at least one in five people or households severely lack food and face starvation and destitution.",
      "Haiti is one of only five countries in the world that have people in the Phase 5 category of catastrophic hunger, Castro said, \u201cand it is really dramatic to have this in the Western Hemisphere.\u201d",
      "Gangs have grown in power since the assassination of President Jovenel Mo\u00efse in July 2021 and are now estimated to control 85% of the capital and are moving into surrounding areas. Haiti has not had a president since the assassination, and the top U.N. official in the country said in April the country could face \u201ctotal chaos\u201d without funding to confront the gangs..",
      "A  U.N.-backed mission led by Kenyan police arrived in Haiti last year to help quell gang violence, but the mission remains understaffed and underfunded, with only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel originally envisioned.",
      "The WFP, the world\u2019s largest humanitarian organization, is among the U.N. agencies facing funding cuts, mainly from the United States, which provided nearly half of its funding in 2024.",
      "Castro said WFP reached over 1.3 million people this year until March using carryover funds from last year. But the agency is facing a dramatic situation now with food stocks only until July to assist with emergencies, new displacements or hurricanes, she said.",
      "In the past four years, Castro said WFP always had stocks to help between 250,000 and 500,000 people with any emergency.",
      "\u201cThis year, we start the hurricane season with an empty warehouse where we have no stocks for assisting any emergency, or we have no cash neither to go and buy (food) locally if it was possible in some areas, or to do a rapid humanitarian response,\u201d Castro said. \u201cWe are very concerned that a single storm can put hundreds of thousands of people in Haiti again into humanitarian catastrophe and hunger.\u201d",
      "WFP normally provides a meal every day for around 500,000 school children, but that number will be cut in half without additional resources, she told a video press conference on Tuesday.",
      "With $46 million, she said, WFP will be able to help the 2 million Haitians in most need of food, keep providing school meals for half a million children, and provide social protection for very vulnerable people in camps for the displaced.",
      "Haiti must not be forgotten as the world deals with other crises, Castro said, urging donors to be generous.",
      "\u201cWe really need to stop this and to hold the line on hunger,\u201d she said. \u201cWe continue calling the humanitarian community to provide support.\u201d",
      "With $46 million, she said, WFP will be able to help the 2 million Haitians in the two worst IPC categories, keep providing school meals for half a million children, and provide social protection for very vulnerable people in camps for the displaced.",

      "The Trump administration must restore hundreds of millions of dollars in AmeriCorps grant funding and thousands of service workers in about two dozen states, a federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Deborah L. Boardman granted a temporary block on the agency\u2019s cancellation of grants and early discharge of corps members, but only for the states that sued the administration in April.",
      "The federal lawsuit, filed by Democratic state officials across the country, accused President Donald Trump\u2019s cost-cutting efforts through the  Department of Government Efficiency of reneging on grants funded through the AmeriCorps State and National program, which was budgeted $557 million in congressionally approved funding this year.",
      "Boardman also said all AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps members that were discharged from their service terms early should be reinstated, if they are willing and able to return.",
      "But Boardman allowed the 30-year-old federal agency for volunteer service to proceed with its reduction in force, denying the states\u2019 request to restore the majority of staff that were put on administrative leave in April. The agency employs more than 500 full-time federal workers and has an operating budget of roughly $1 billion.",

      "It sends roughly 200,000 corps members across the country as part of its service programs. Most corps members get a living stipend during their service and become eligible for funding for future education expenses or to apply for certain student loans.",
      "As part of the AmeriCorps State and National grant program, state volunteer commissions distributed more than $177 million in formula-based distributions, as well as $370 million in competitive grants that supported nearly 35,000 corps members serving at 300 organizations, according to announcements last year.",
      "Notices of grants being terminated were sent late on a Friday in April, explaining \u201cthe award no longer effectuates agency priorities\u201d and directing grantees to immediately shut down the projects, according to a copy reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "The states that sued the administration said those extensive and immediate cancellations did not provide the legally required notice and comment period. They said the result would be severely curtailed services and programs for vulnerable populations since states and organizations could not fill the funding void.",
      "AmeriCorps argued in court filings that a temporary block on the agency\u2019s actions as the lawsuit proceeds would disrupt efforts to comply with Trump\u2019s executive order creating DOGE and to \u201cact as responsible stewards of public funds,\" according to court filings.",
      "Despite bipartisan support, AmeriCorps has long been a target of critics who decry bloat, inefficiencies and misuse of funds.",

      "CHELMSFORD, Mass. -- A Massachusetts high school student arrested on his way to volleyball practice last weekend was scheduled to appear before an immigration judge Thursday.",
      "Marcelo Gomes da Silva, 18, who came to the U.S. from Brazil at age 7, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday. Authorities have said the agents were looking for the Milford High School teenager\u2019s father, who owns the car Gomes da Silva was driving at the time and had parked in a friend\u2019s driveway.",
      "The teen faced a hearing in immigration court in Chelmsford.",
      "U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said earlier this week that ICE officers were targeting a \u201cknown public safety threat\u201d and that Gomes da Silva\u2019s father \u201chas a habit of reckless driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour through residential areas.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile ICE officers never intended to apprehend Gomes da Silva, he was found to be in the United States illegally and subject to removal proceedings, so officers made the arrest,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Gomes da Silva initially entered the country on a visitor visa and was later issued a student visa that has since lapsed, said his attorney, Robin Nice. She described him as deeply rooted in his community and a dedicated member of both the school marching band and a band at his church.",
      "A federal judge considering Gomes da Silva\u2019s request to be released while his immigration case proceeds has given the government until June 16 to respond and has ordered that Gomes da Silva not be moved out of Massachusetts without 48 hours\u2019 notice given to the court. The government sought permission Wednesday to move Gomes da Silva to a detention facility in a different New England state, Nice said, a move his lawyers opposed because they feared it would delay the immigration hearing. A judge quickly denied the request.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is leaving the Department of Government Efficiency behind, but its playbook has impacted dozens of agencies, departments and organizations and left thousands of federal workers unemployed or in limbo",
      "WASHINGTON -- The staff was already jittery.",
      "The raiders from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency had disposed of the U.S. Institute of Peace board, its acting president and its longtime outside counsel. But until 9:30 p.m. on Friday, March 28, there was hope the damage might somehow be limited.",
      "Then termination notices started popping up in personal emails. That was only the start.",
      "After ending his sojourn in Washington, Musk left behind a wounded federal government. DOGE's playbook was consistent: Show up physically, take over the facility and information technology systems, fire the leadership and replace it with DOGE associates. Dismiss the staff. Move so quickly that the targets and the courts have little time to react, let alone reverse whatever damage has already occurred.",
      "Thousands of workers across the federal government saw the playbook in action over the last four months. But the Institute of Peace, a small, 300-employee organization, is unique: The blitz during its takeover has been, for the moment, reversed in court. The headquarters taken away in a weekend of lightning moves is back in the hands of its original board and acting president.",
      "The question they must answer now is a point that U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell made during one hearing: Even a win \u201cmakes no promises\u201d about how difficult or possible it will be to put the Institute of Peace back together. \u201cA bull in a China shop breaks a lot of things,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Nearly three weeks since the judge delivered a win, the institute is slowly trying to reboot. But there are barriers, and winning might not mean full restoration. For other agencies and departments fighting their own DOGE battles, it is a cautionary tale.",
      "The Institute of Peace was created by Congress in the 1980s. President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law in 1985. Described as an independent, nonprofit think tank funded by Congress, its mission has been to work to promote peace and prevent and end conflicts while working outside normal channels such as the State Department. When DOGE came knocking, it was operating in 26 conflict zones, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mali and Burkina Faso.",
      "The institute was one of four organizations targeted by President Donald Trump\u2019s Feb. 19 Executive Order 14217. The order said it was being enacted to \u201cdramatically reduce the size of the federal government.\u201d",
      "The institute\u2019s acting president, career diplomat and former Ambassador George Moose, and longtime outside counsel George Foote tried to explain to DOGE representatives that the institute was an independent nonprofit outside the executive branch.",
      "That attempt was for naught. At 4 p.m. on March 14, most of the institute\u2019s board was fired by email. The lone holdovers were ex officio \u2014 Cabinet members Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio and the National Defense University's president, Vice Adm. Peter Garvin. Within minutes of the emails, DOGE staff showed up and tried to get into the building but failed over the next several hours during a standoff.",
      "That, according to court documents, kicked off a weekend of pressure by the FBI on institute security personnel. DOGE returned the following Monday and got into the headquarters with help from the FBI and Washington police officers.",
      "Foote thought the local officers were there to expel the DOGE contingent but learned quickly they were not. He, security chief Colin O\u2019Brien and others were escorted out by local authorities. \u201cThey have sidearms and tasers and are saying you can't go anywhere but out that door,\u201d Foote said. \u201cI had no choice. 'You guys have the guns, and I don't.'\u201d",
      "The board filed a lawsuit the following day and asked for a temporary restraining order. Howell expressed dissatisfaction with DOGE's tactics but declined to restore the fired board members or bar DOGE staff from the headquarters.",
      "By then a DOGE associate, Kenneth Jackson, had been named as acting president of the organization by the ex officio board members. Employees held out hope that the organization would not be disassembled because Jackson was asking questions as if he might do an assessment of the organization's work, said Scott Worden, director of the Afghanistan and Central Asia programs.",
      "The staff knew what he'd done as the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Now Jackson was at the Institute of Peace, but they were hopeful \"we would have a process of explanation or review of our work,\u201d Worden said.",
      "Then came March 28. The notices came alphabetically. By the time it was finished, shortly before midnight, almost all the institute's 300 employees had been let go.",
      "The impact was \u201cprofound and devastating on a few levels,\u201d Worden said. First, employees at the institute are not government employees so they got no government benefits or civil service protections. Insurance also was gone \u2014 critical for employees fighting health problems. Partners abroad also suddenly lost their support and contacts. It left \u201cthousands of partners in a lurch,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawyers representing board members in their lawsuit asked for a court hearing as soon as possible to head off rumors of more mayhem to come. But when they walked into courtroom 26A of the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse at 10 a.m. on April 1, the headquarters and other assets were gone, too. It was, Howell said at the hearing, \u201ca done deal.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, as workers reeled, DOGE was making personnel changes of its own. Jackson had given way to DOGE representative Nick Cavanaugh, whose name was on the documents that allowed DOGE to take control of Institute of Peace assets and transfer the headquarters \u2014 built in part with private donations \u2014 to the General Services Administration.",
      "Howell was incredulous that it had been accomplished in two days. In court, the Trump administration\u2019s attorney, Brian Hudak, laid out the timeline, making clear that the newly named president of the institute had not only been authorized to transfer the property but also the request had gone through proper channels. For the second time, Howell refused to stop the actions.",
      "Throughout hearings, Howell struggled with how to describe the institute \u2014 whether it was part of the executive branch and under the Republican president's authority. That was central to the case. The government argued that it had to fall under one of the three branches of government and it clearly wasn't legislative or judicial. Lawyers defending the government also said that because presidents appointed the board, presidents also had the authority to fire them.",
      "The White House also maintained that despite decades of operation and an annual budget of around $50 million, the institute had failed to bring peace and was rightfully targeted.",
      "Howell's May 19 opinion concluded that the institute \u201cultimately exercises no Executive branch power under the Constitution but operates, through research, educational teaching, and scholarship, in the sensitive area of global peace.\"",
      "\u201cIn creating this organization,\u201d the judge said, \"Congress struck a careful balance between political accountability, on the one hand, and partisan independence and stability, on the other.\u201d",
      "She added that even if the organization was part of the executive branch, the law that created it set specific steps for firing the board members and none of those had been followed. Because the board was fired illegally, all subsequent actions \u2014 including replacing Moose, firing the staff and transferring the headquarters \u2014 were \u201cnull and void,\u201d she said in her ruling.",
      "The government filed a notice of appeal and asked Howell to stay her order. She said no. The government has requested a stay with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.",
      "Two weeks later, about 10% of the people who would normally be inside the headquarters, about 25 people, are there, doing maintenance, getting systems running and trying to get to the institute\u2019s funding.",
      "Any physical damage comes more from inattentiveness than malice \u2014 food that spoiled, leaks that went unfixed, popup security barriers needing maintenance. Desks are empty but with paperwork and files strewn across them, left by the speed of the takeover.",
      "O\u2019Brien, the security officer, praised the General Services Administration and security managers who tried to keep the building going. But getting systems fully functioning will entail lots of work. \u201cWe\u2019re the first ones to get behind the looking glass,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "Foote said those returning continue to try to locate and access the institute's funding. That includes funds appropriated for this fiscal year by Congress and the part of the endowment moved during the takeover. He said transferring funds within the federal government is \u201ccomplicated.\u201d The result: Workers are furloughed, and overseas offices will remain closed.",
      "Nicoletta Barbera, acting director for the U.S. Institute of Peace's West Africa and Central Africa programs, is one of the furloughed workers.",
      "\u201cWe had USIP representatives based in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger that, overnight, were left with no support system from anyone here in HQ,\u201d she said. The programs were focused on preventing terrorism by supporting women and young people, to \u201cidentify signs of radicalization.\u201d",
      "Barbera said a recent attack in Burkina Faso ended with \u201chundreds of atrocities and deaths.\u201d",
      "\"And I couldn\u2019t just stop but think, what if I could have continued our work there during this time?\u201d she said.",
      "Moose has said the speed at which the organization gets back to work depends on numerous factors, including the appeals process. But, he said, there will likely be lasting damage \u2014 \u201cthe traumatic effects this has had on the people who have been impacted by it.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd, obviously, that includes our own ... staff members,\u201d Moose said, \"but it also extends to the people with whom we collaborate and work all around the world. That\u2019s going to be hard to repair.\u201d",

      "While it remains unclear what prompted the fatal shooting of Jonathan Joss, a Native American voice actor best known for his work on the animated television series \"King of the Hill,\" police say they are looking into whether his sexual orientation played a role in his death.",
      "Joss' husband has claimed it was a hate crime, saying the person who killed the actor yelled \"violent homophobic slurs\" before opening fire.",
      "Initially, San Antonio police said they found \"no evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr. Joss' murder was related to his sexual orientation.\"",
      "But on Thursday, San Antonio Police Chief William McManus walked back that statement, saying it had been made prematurely and whether Joss' sexual orientation played a role in the shooting \"is part of the investigation.\"",
      "Since Joss' killing, friends, actors Joss worked with and fans have honored the actor's memory with tributes and fond remembrances.",
      "Here's what to know about Joss, his career and his shooting:",
      "Who was Joss?",
      "Joss, 59, grew up in San Antonio and graduated from the communications and theater program at Our Lady of the Lake University in 1990.",
      "Joss was best known as the voice of John Redcorn, a Native American character on the popular \"King of the Hill\" animated series, which ran for 13 seasons from 1997 to 2008. A reboot of the show, which Joss had already worked on, is set to start in August.",

      "\"We may have lost our home, but not our hope. We're moving forward with love, humor, and a little elbow grease \u2026 and we're incredibly grateful for every ounce of support,\" Joss said in a May 14 Facebook post in which he indicated he was in Los Angeles looking for a new home.",

    "story": [
      "When Audra McDonald won her first Tony Award at 23, it was just the beginning of a record-breaking Broadway career. Earlier this month, she received her 11th Tony nomination, making her the most Tony-nominated actor of all time.",
      "McDonald, who with six Tony Awards already shares the record for the\u00a0performer with the most Tonys ever\u00a0with Angela Lansbury and Julie Harris, received the nomination for her portrayal of Mama Rose in the latest Broadway revival of \"Gypsy.\"",
      "Before she discovered the stage, McDonald described herself as a hyperactive kid who would express her emotions frequently.",
      "\"I had big feelings. I had music in my heart. And so once I found theater, it was like I have a place to put my big feelings now,\" she said.",
      "Those emotions are on full display as Mama Rose, a character based on the real-life mother of famed burlesque entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee. It is currently being shown at the Majestic Theatre. In the musical, Mama Rose is an intense stage mom.",
      "McDonald first stepped into the role during a concert at Carnegie Hall in 2022, performing the musical's emotional climax \"Rose's Turn.\"",
      "\"It was the same time of year that I was getting ready to send my daughter off to college. And I was dealing with all this rage I was having at my sweet, wonderful daughter,\" McDonald said. \"And I burst into tears and I realized it's because my baby's leaving and I'm sad. So then that was my first sort, like, emotional dive into Rose.\"",
      "McDonald is the first Black woman to portray Mama Rose on Broadway. Director George C. Wolfe guided her interpretation of what Rose would be experiencing in the 1920s and 30s, with not one word of the original script changed.",
      "\"George talks a lot about Rose's obsession with the kids becoming stars is because being a star protects you in some way. You got star money, you could eat. You got star money, maybe you won't be lynched,\" McDonald explained. \"And so she as a single woman at this time, abandoned three times by her husbands, abandoned by her mother, not really treated all that well by her father, she's tryin' to protect these babies.\"",
      "Behind the Curtain",
      "The \"CBS Mornings\" interview went backstage to find out what happens when the curtain closes. McDonald and her co-star Danny Burstein are \"of a certain age,\" she laughed, noting they don't run up the stairs after performances.",
      "McDonald showed how she warms up to take on the demanding role.",
      "\"One thing that a lotta singers do is humming. Just like (humming), you're doing things like that just to sort of and people do that, whether you're singing or not. It's good just to sort of make sure that everything's sort of moving and healthy. And you know, to do it eight times a week,\" she said.",
      "Inspiring the next generation",
      "Despite her countless accolades, McDonald still struggles with being called a legend.",
      "\"If it can mean something to some little Black girl somewhere who says 'She did it and she looks like me so I can do it,' great,\" she said. \"But I can't really comprehend what that means to me about me. You know what I mean? 'Cause I can't, you know, as I see how dirty my closet is, and the fact that I have not done laundry in four weeks.\"",

    "summary": "The norovirus strain GII.17 may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said the agency is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory\u00a0database\u00a0and pointed to a surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and Europe in 2014 that was followed by no reports of a change to seasonality.",
      "They also cautioned that there was no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.",
      "\"There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

      "The new vaccine, mNexspike, is a step toward next-generation coronavirus vaccines. It's made in a way that allows for a lower dose - a fifth of the dose of its current COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax - by refining its immune target.",

    "published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 07:53:41 -0400",
    "summary": "Meta platforms such as Instagram have marketed AI tools that let users create sexually explicit images of real people.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has removed a number of ads promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people \u2014 after a CBS News investigation found hundreds of such advertisements on its platforms.",
      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive,\u00a0 upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification. So when these apps come up for review on the Apple or Google store, they don't necessarily have the wherewithal to ban them,\" he said.",
      "\"There needs to be cross-industry cooperation where if the app or the website markets itself as a tool for nudification on any place on the web, then everyone else can be like, 'All right, I don't care what you present yourself as on my platform, you're gone,'\" Mantzarlis added.",
      "CBS News has reached out to both Apple and Google for comment as to how they moderate their respective platforms. Neither company had responded by the time of writing.",
      "Major tech companies' promotion of such apps raises serious questions about both user consent and about online safety for minors. A CBS News analysis of one \"nudify\" website promoted on Instagram showed that the site did not prompt any form of age verification prior to a user uploading a photo to generate a deepfake image.",
      "Such issues are widespread. In December, CBS News' 60 Minutes reported on the lack of age verification on one of the most popular sites using artificial intelligence to generate fake nude photos of real people.",
      "Despite visitors being told that they must be 18 or older to use the site, and that \"processing of minors is impossible,\" 60 Minutes was able to immediately gain access to uploading photos once the user clicked \"accept\" on the age warning prompt, with no other age verification necessary.",
      "Data also shows that a high percentage of underage teenagers have interacted with deepfake content. A March 2025 study conducted by the children's protection nonprofit Thorn showed that among teens, 41% said they had heard of the term \"deepfake nudes,\" while 10% reported personally knowing someone who had had deepfake nude imagery created of them.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2025-pride-celebrations-corporate-sponsor-cancellations/",
    "published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 05:00:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The organizers of prominent Pride celebrations saw huge sponsorship drop-offs this year, a pattern seen as a response to the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The architects of Pride celebrations across the United States met six-figure challenges this year, owing to a corporate exodus in the spring that diminished their sponsorship funds, which they said would jeopardize future programming. Organizers are contending with serious budget shortfalls as Pride Month begins, and several reported 20% to 30% less corporate support than in past years.",
      "The show will go on this summer, they said, but what happens next is less certain.",
      "\"We're going to make it to the event,\" said Suzanne Ford, the executive director of San Francisco Pride, who told CBS News five corporate sponsors cut ties with the organization over the course of one overwhelming week in March and several others reduced their funding. \"The real question now is, what kind of shape are we going to be in on the other side of Pride? Are we going to be able to keep the doors open?\"",
      "Corporate partners that backed out of San Francisco Pride this year were historically among its largest and most reliable donors, including Nissan Comcast/Xfinity and Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch. Along with Target, Bud Light has faced public backlash and boycotts over its Pride advertising in recent years.",
      "\"That hurt us greatly,\" Ford said of losing Anheuser-Busch, previously \"one of the very largest\" sponsors of San Francisco Pride. \"Comcast and Nissan have been significant and have been longtime partners. They've been with us for a long time, so it was money that we've counted on.\"",
      "Their retreats meant San Francisco Pride was operating at a loss of about $300,000, which Ford hopes will shrink to about $200,000 once increased donations are factored in from other sponsors, who raised their pledges to narrow the gaps left by the bigger brands. Two large corporate partners, Benefit Cosmetics and La Crema, initially dropped their sponsorship contracts but have since returned as partners, Ford said.",
      "Several brands that stepped back from Pride partnerships in San Francisco have done the same in other cities. Anheuser-Busch, known for decades as a supporter of the LGBTQ community, also declined to sponsor the 2025 Pride Festival in its hometown of St. Louis,\u00a0according to that event's organizers. The company had been one of their leading sponsors for the last 30 years, the organizer's said.",
      "Pride Month was originally conceived as a way to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots, which are credited with kick-starting the modern gay rights movement, and it has evolved since then into a multifaceted celebration of the LGBTQ community. Local Pride plans typically involve multiday event rosters with at least one march, parade or festival, which are intermittently known to draw a million or more attendees.",
      "Celebrations around Pride grew tremendously over the last decade or so, organizers say, in large part because of an influx of corporate sponsorships cropping up after the U.S. legalized marriage equality in 2015. The upward trend in brand support was so steep for a period of time that some sponsors were\u00a0accused of exploiting LGBTQ issues\u00a0for the purpose of turning a profit.",
      "That trend looked very different this year, as corporate sponsors around the country either withdrew their support for Pride festivities or significantly scaled it back. Many attributed their decisions to financial strain or internal transitions, according to statements from several companies and organizers who recalled their conversations to CBS News.",
      "\"Nissan is currently reviewing all marketing and sales spending \u2014 including select consumer auto shows, sports properties and other entertainment activations \u2014 to maximize both efficiency and breakthrough effectiveness,\" a Nissan spokesperson said of the brand breaking partnerships with Pride organizers in San Francisco as well as New York City.",
      "But organizers and supporters see a pattern in the sponsorship cancellations, which some consider implicit byproducts of the Trump administration's\u00a0anti-DEI policies and ongoing\u00a0attacks on transgender Americans. Ron de Harte, the co-president of the Board of Directors at USA Prides, a national network of Pride organizations, said the decline in national brand sponsorships for Pride events is widespread this year.",
      "\"This is happening with festival and event sponsorships across the board,\" said de Harte in a statement. \"Of course, bad economic times are coupled with the current administration's unfriendly actions toward the LGBTQ communities, so some markets have sponsors who have moved on.\"",
      "As the Capital Pride Alliance organized WorldPride this year in Washington, D.C., it grappled with a litany of complications leading up to this weekend's international gathering. After President Trump took over the Kennedy Center, multiple WorldPride events were either canceled or relocated under new leadership. In addition, the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, a major federal contractor, backed out of its 2025 WorldPride contract in a move that critics thought bent to government pressure.",
      "A spokesperson for Capital Pride Alliance said Booz Allen was the only WorldPride sponsor that canceled a finalized contract, but others dropped out in various stages of the sponsorship process, including Comcast/Xfinity, Deloitte and Visa. The spokesperson said some brands became \"silent partners,\" which means they donate in the background but avoid the publicity that can come with outright sponsorship.",
      "Matt Cheng, the director of corporate sponsorships at Heritage of Pride, the nonprofit that produces New York City Pride events, told CBS News that its corporate partners gave various explanations for decreasing or eliminating support. Economic weariness was among them, he said, along with fear of retaliation.",
      "\"One of the big ones is the tariffs and economy. A lot of budgets have gotten slashed from a DEI and marketing perspective,\" he said. \"But then the other one is fear of backlash from the federal government.\"",
      "Heritage of Pride lost roughly one-quarter of its sponsorship dollars, or about $750,000, in the last few months. Large companies like Deutsche Bank ramped up their earlier donations to organizations because of the shortfall, and a poll of about 100 individual donors recently gave $10,000 or so, Cheng said. He hoped New York City Pride fundraisers would bring them closer to zero losses.",
      "\"In addition to reviewing our budget lines to make sure we can afford to put on Pride the way that it typically is put on, our other concern is our year-round programming,\" he said.",
      "More immediately, a 25% budget gap would likely require Heritage of Pride to cut their only two grant programs, both of which support at-risk communities, Cheng added.",
      "Like San Francisco, St. Louis and WorldPride in D.C., New York City Pride also lost large sponsors. Nissan and PepsiCo both pulled support from Heritage of Pride after previously being top donors, according to public partnership information released last year and Kevin Kilbride, the media and marketing manager at the nonprofit. Other sponsors have reduced their funding but are still planning to march in the upcoming Manhattan parade, Kilbride said.",
      "Target has remained a silent partner of New York City Pride. Kilbride said Target continues to be \"a valued partner\" and its sponsorship this year was \"at a level consistent with years' past.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely dedicated to fostering inclusivity for everyone \u2014 our team members, our guests, our supply partners, and the more than 2,000 communities we're proud to serve,\" a Target spokesperson said in a statement. \"As we have for many years, we will continue to mark Pride Month by offering an assortment of celebratory products, hosting internal programming to support our incredible team and sponsoring local events in neighborhoods across the country.\"",

      "\"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Following through on the threat could cost Musk billions. His two largest companies, SpaceX and Tesla, both benefit from a wide array of government programs ranging from lunar launch contracts to electric car incentives.",
      "Musk answered Mr. Trump with a threat of his own, vowing to cut off SpaceX's manned spacecraft program. Investors appear to be taking the squabble seriously: As the two men traded barbs Thursday, Tesla's share price tanked 14%.",
      "SpaceX",
      "Musk's rocket company has received tens of billions of dollars from the federal government over the last decade, including $3.8 billion in the 2024 fiscal year alone, according to federal records.",
      "The bulk of those federal grants are from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. NASA has paid SpaceX billions over the last decade to ferry astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station. The agency has also awarded SpaceX upwards of $2 billion in recent years to design and build a lunar lander, as part of NASA's Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the moon for the first time in a half-century.",
      "NASA's partnership with Musk ramped up during the Obama administration, which hired SpaceX and Boeing to build spacecraft to transport astronauts \u2014 aiming to end NASA's reliance on Russia following the end of the Space Shuttle program. In recent years, SpaceX has carried out several missions to and from the space station using its Dragon spacecraft.",
      "Musk responded to Mr. Trump's threat Thursday to cut off contracts by saying SpaceX would \"begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\" Hours later, Musk wrote, \"Ok, we won't decommission Dragon,\" in response to an X user who encouraged him to \"cool off and take a step back.\"",
      "A NASA spokesperson told CBS News the agency will \"continue to work with our industry partners to ensure the President's objectives in space are met.\"",
      "Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, dismissed the idea that the government would cancel contracts with Musk and his companies. \"I'm [not] going to comment on who's right or wrong. But [Trump's] not going to take away our only way to get to the Space Station [and] back. I mean, that's ridiculous,\" he told reporters Thursday.",
      "SpaceX has received grants from a handful of other federal agencies, including the Department of Defense, which has awarded the company hundreds of millions for launch services.",
      "Starlink \u2014 a division of SpaceX that offers satellite internet services \u2014 also has links to the federal government. As of earlier this year, the company was in line to take over a multi-billion dollar contract to upgrade the Federal Aviation Administration's aging air traffic control communication systems.",
      "Tesla",
      "Musk's electric car company gets far fewer direct federal grants than SpaceX \u2014 but it indirectly makes billions of dollars a year as a result of various state and federal programs.",
      "The federal government has signed deals to buy cars from Tesla here and there, though a plan for the State Department to buy some $400 million worth of armored vehicles was called off this year.",
      "More importantly, Tesla reported making almost $2.8 billion last year by selling \"regulatory credits\" to other carmakers, helping rival companies reach the car emissions rules set by various governments. Tesla is in an unusually strong position to sell credits because, unlike most carmakers, it exclusively makes zero-emission electric vehicles \u2014 and those credit sales come at a \"negligible\" cost to the company, Tesla said in its 2024 annual report.",
      "Many credits are sold to comply with state-level emissions rules, most notably in California, though congressional Republicans have sought to roll back some of the federal waivers that California needs to impose tougher emissions standards than the federal government.",
      "If California's regulatory credit program goes away, it could cost Tesla some $2 billion, JPMorgan Chase estimated in a report last month.",
      "Tesla customers also benefit from a $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicle purchases, a program designed to increase sales of electric cars \u2014 including Teslas. And the company's solar power division gets a boost from federal renewable energy tax credits. Many of those incentives would end or face new restrictions under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a domestic policy bill containing Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. It passed by the House last month and is now being considered by the Senate.",
      "The end of those tax credits may cost Tesla $1.2 billion, according to JPMorgan Chase.",
      "Musk has previously shrugged off the idea of winding down electric car tax incentives: \"Take away the subsidies. It will only help Tesla,\" he said on X last year. Some analysts \u2014 and possibly Musk \u2014 think an end to electric car credits would hurt Tesla's rivals more than Tesla. Nonetheless, in a post last month, Tesla pushed for a \"sensible wind down\" of some renewable energy tax credits, arguing an abrupt end would \"would threaten America's energy independence.\"",
      "Musk, for his part, called the One Big Beautiful Bill Act a \"disgusting abomination\" this week, helping ignite the feud with Mr. Trump. The billionaire's public criticisms of the bill focus largely on the bill's cost. But Mr. Trump said Thursday that Musk \"went CRAZY\" after \"I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted.\"",

      "CBS News has reached out to Tesla and SpaceX for comment.",
      "This isn't the first time the president has needled Musk over his companies' federal subsidies. In a 2022 feud, Mr. Trump claimed Musk would be \"worthless\" without hefty subsidies for \"electric cars that don't drive long enough\" and \"rocketships to nowhere.\"",
      "At that time, Musk argued Mr. Trump should not run for another term as president, saying he should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\"",
      "The two ended up mending their relationship. Musk spent hundreds of millions to help elect Mr. Trump in 2024, and he led the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency in the Trump administration's early months, forging a tight alliance with Mr. Trump \u2014 until this week.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 21:16:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A private lunar lander from Tokyo-based company ispace was aiming for a touchdown in the unexplored far north with a mini rover.",
    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese lander attempted to touch down on the moon Thursday, but telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity moments before communications were lost. The data suggested a mission-ending crash landing.",
      "\"Based on the currently available data, the Mission Control Center has been able to confirm the following: The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values,\" ispace, builder of the Resilience lander, said in a statement.",
      "\"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\"",
      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "summary": "Once the deal is finalized, the seafood chain will operate under a new CEO \u2014 Damola Adamolekun, former chief executive of P.F. Chang's.",
    "story": [
      "After months of dozens of restaurant closings and headlines about \"endless shrimp\" woes, the seafood chain says it will soon exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.",
      "A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved the casual seafood chain's reorganization plan, which includes a lender group led by asset manager Fortress acquiring the business. The green light arrives under just four months after Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy protection as it pursued a sale, following years of mounting losses and dwindling customers while it struggled to keep up with competitors.",
      "At the time of filing in May, Red Lobster's leadership shared plans to \"simplify the business\" through a reduction of locations. The chain, which lost $76 million in 2023, shuttered dozens of its North American restaurants over recent months \u2014 both leading up to and during the bankruptcy process. That includes more than 50 locations whose equipment was put up for auction just days before the Chapter 11 petition, followed by additional closures throughout the bankruptcy process.",
      "Red Lobster said Thursday that it expects to operate about 544 locations across the U.S. and Canada upon emerging from bankruptcy. That's down from 578 disclosed as of May's bankruptcy filing.",
      "Under terms of the acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of September, the chain will continue to operate as an independent company.",
      "Once the deal is finalized, Red Lobster will also get a new CEO \u2014 Damola Adamolekun, former chief executive of P.F. Chang's.",
      "Adamolekun was appointed to head RL Investor Holdings, the newly formed entity acquiring Red Lobster, by Fortress last week. In a statement Thursday, Adamolekun said that Red Lobster \"has a tremendous future\" and thanked Jonathan Tibus, who will leave the company and step down as CEO, for his leadership during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Red Lobster's purchaser is also providing additional funding to help the Orlando, Florida-based chain get back on its feet post-emergence. Adamolekun said the company's long-term investment plan includes a commitment of more than $60 million in new funding.",
      "Multiple ownership changes",
      "Known for its affordable seafood and cheddar biscuits, Red Lobster has seen multiple ownership changes over the course of its 56-year history. The brand was founded back in 1968 by Bill Darden, who sold Red Lobster to General Mills in 1970. General Mills later went on to form Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and other chains. Darden Restaurants was spun off from General Mills in 1995.",
      "Darden Restaurants later sold Red Lobster to a private equity firm in 2014. Thai Union Group, one of the world's largest seafood suppliers, first invested in Red Lobster in 2016 and upped its stake in 2020 \u2014 but announced its intention to exit its minority investment earlier this year.",
      "When announcing plans to divest in January, CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said the COVID-19 pandemic, industry headwinds and rising operating costs from Red Lobster had resulted in \"prolonged negative financial contributions to Thai Union and its shareholders.\" It reported a $19 million loss from Red Lobster for the first nine months of 2023.",
      "While not the sole reason, among sources of loss were \u2014 yes \u2014 those endless shrimp. Last year, Red Lobster significantly expanded the iconic all-you-can-eat special. But customer demand overwhelmed what the chain could afford. Thai Union leadership later noted that the deal's $20 price tag wasn't making enough money.",
      "Last year's shrimp debacle\u00a0wasn't the first time Red Lobster saw consequences of \"endless\" promises. In 2003, the company reportedly lost millions of dollars on an all-you-can-eat \"Endless Crab\" promotion when crab prices rose.",

    "summary": "Spike in early Social Security claims this year points to growing concerns about the health of the Social Security system, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Older Americans are filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, a surge that could reflect growing anxiety about the stability of the retirement system amid cutbacks under the Trump administration, experts say.",
      "The number of people claiming Social Security jumped 17% to 1.8 million this year through May compared with the same period a year ago, according to the most recent data from the Social Security Administration. For the federal fiscal year, new filings are on track to reach 4 million, up 15% from the prior fiscal year, the Urban Institute said in a new analysis of claims data.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, an agency already struggling to provide services to the nearly 70 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "These developments are likely prompting the surge in new filings, as well as an increase in calls and in-person visits to Social Security offices since January, the Urban Institute said.",
      "Although Mr. Trump has vowed not to touch Social Security, his administration is has cut\u00a0the agency's staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers. The agency's workforce has been shrinking for years, with the AARP noting that the Social Security Administration had 63,000 workers in 2015.",
      "Even as its workforce shrinks, the Social Security Administration is serving more people, with the number of beneficiaries rising 19% from about 59 million people in 2015 to about 70 million today, its data shows.",
      "\"I have attended several town halls around the country, and many people have asked if they should claim benefits early given Trump and [Elon] Musk's interference in the system,\" Max Richtman, president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the two retirement programs, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"People are scared, and they're not sure what to do.\"",
      "To be sure, Americans have long held concerns about the stability of the Social Security system. Because the agency is paying out more in benefits than it's taking in through payroll taxes due to the nation's aging demographics, the program is currently dipping into its trust fund to pay beneficiaries.",
      "Without changes to the program, the trust fund is slated to be depleted in 2035, which will trigger a benefits cut of about 20%, the agency has forecast.",
      "An aging society",
      "Other factors could be driving the increase in early Social Security filings, the Urban Institute said. For one, the baby boomer generation is hitting \"peak 65\" as a record number of people hit retirement age, although that demographic shift isn't enough to entirely explain this year's surge in claims, the think tank noted.",
      "Another cause could be the Social Security Fairness Act, which provides more retirement benefits to public servants such as teachers, firefighters and police officers, and could encourage more people to file, the Urban analysis said.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, the Social Security Administration pointed to three causes for the increase in filings this year: boomers hitting \"peak 65,\" the Social Security Fairness Act, and mailers the agency sent to spouses and surviving spouses alerting them that they could receive a higher benefit if they use their own record to claim benefits. (Social Security allows people to receive payments based on their spouse's earnings starting at age 62.)",
      "Frank Bisignano, the agency's new commissioner, told CBS News last month that the program will be able to provide services to beneficiaries despite the staffing cuts \"through technology and process engineering.\"",
      "He added, \"Everybody is committed to Social Security for the rest of time.\"",
      "The downside to claiming early",
      "The agency is receiving more early claims from higher-income Americans, especially at age 62, which is the earliest age at which a worker can start receiving their monthly Social Security benefits, the Urban Institute said.",
      "But there's a major cost to claiming at 62. While it might seem prudent to claim early if you're worried Social Security won't be around in a few years \u2014 something that experts say is extremely unlikely \u2014 the tradeoff is a permanently lower monthly benefit.",
      "People who claim Social Security benefits at 62 receive about\u00a030% less\u00a0in their monthly checks than if they wait until they turn 67, which is currently the program's full retirement age. Older Americans can collect even greater benefits if they delay filing past their full retirement age, getting an extra 24% boost to their monthly check if they wait until they turn 70.",
      "Because of that math, Richtman said his group recommends holding off on claiming, even though people might be fearful about the program's health.",
      "\"Their concern is understandable. But we advise workers not to claim early out of fear, because filing for Social Security before full retirement age results in a lifetime reduction in benefits,\" he said.",

      "Their spat played out in public and marked another remarkable turn for Musk, who spent tens of millions on Mr. Trump's reelection campaign and was given the reins to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Here's a look back at how Mr. Trump and Musk got here:",
      "Trump \"not the right guy,\" Musk says in 2016",
      "The Tesla CEO praised Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies as \"the right ones\" in an interview with CNBC before the 2016 election.",
      "\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy,\" Musk said of Mr. Trump at the time. \"He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\"",
      "\"I don't think this is the finest moment in our democracy,\" Musk added.",
      "Musk joins \u2014 and quits \u2014 Trump administration roles",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's first term began, Musk joined a handful of White House advisory boards, including Mr. Trump's \"manufacturing jobs council.\"",
      "But Musk left those roles just months later, citing Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords.",
      "\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk tweeted in June 2017.",
      "Musk continued to have a close relationship with the federal government, however, as his rocket company SpaceX has billions in contracts with NASA and other agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump praised Musk at a 2020 SpaceX launch in Florida, saying at one point: \"I speak to him all the time. Great guy. He's one of our great brains. We like great brains. And Elon has done a fantastic job.\"",
      "Musk sours on Democrats in 2022 \u2014 but still feuds with Trump",
      "In May 2022, Musk said he was ending his support for Democrats because \"they have become the party of division & hate.\"",
      "\"So I can no longer support them and will vote Republican,\" Musk tweeted, later adding that he voted for Clinton in 2016 and former President Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "But just two months later, Musk suggested he didn't support Mr. Trump launching another run for the White House amid a public spat with the then-former president over the course of several days in July 2022. Mr. Trump called the Tesla CEO a \"b---s--- artist\" at a rally and said his companies would be \"worthless\" without federal backing, while Musk tweeted Mr. Trump should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\"",
      "Later in 2022, Musk purchased Twitter, now known as X, and quickly reinstated Mr. Trump's account, which had been suspended since the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The reinstatement came four days after Mr. Trump announced his third run for the presidency after losing to Biden.",
      "In the Republican presidential primary, Musk initially threw his support behind one of Mr. Trump's rivals, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In May 2023, the billionaire and the Floridian appeared together on a glitchy Twitter livestream to launch DeSantis' campaign.",

      "\"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Musk wrote alongside video of the bloodied presidential candidate raising his fist in the air as he was surrounded by Secret Service agents.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump on the campaign trail and spent roughly $277 million to help elect him and other Republican candidates, mostly through a Musk-backed super PAC called America PAC, campaign finance records show.",
      "Mr. Trump shouted Musk out during his election night victory speech: \"A star is born,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's an amazing guy.\"",

      "Musk quickly became a member of Mr. Trump's inner circle, participating in Cabinet meetings and traveling on Air Force One with his young son. Less than a month into his government service, Musk professed\u00a0on X: \"I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.\"",
      "DOGE quickly gained vast influence within the Trump administration, slashing government staff and nearly dismantling some federal agencies.",
      "Musk and Mr. Trump appeared together in the Oval Office in February \u2014 with Musk's son in tow \u2014 and jointly answered questions from the press.",
      "Mr. Trump stood by Musk as some of his efforts drew backlash. In late February, a DOGE-backed email telling federal employees to report what they had accomplished in the preceding week sparked confusion in some agencies. During a Cabinet meeting days later, Mr. Trump called Musk \"tremendously successful\" and said people were \"thrilled\" with his performance \u2014 and said federal workers who haven't responded to the emails are \"on the bubble.\"",
      "When Tesla faced protests from Trump opponents, the president boosted Musk, climbing into a Tesla on the White House South Lawn in March and calling the car \"beautiful.\" Days prior, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social he would \"buy a brand new Tesla\" as a show of support for Musk, who the president said was \"doing a FANTASTIC JOB.\"",
      "Musk clashed with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in April over Mr. Trump's tariff strategy. Musk called Navarro \"dumber than a sack of bricks\" after Navarro said Tesla relies on \"cheap foreign parts.\" Mr. Trump's White House didn't take sides: \"Boys will be boys,\" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",

      "Days before wrapping up his work for the federal government, Musk began criticizing a massive piece of legislation aimed at advancing Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. Musk told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" he was \"disappointed\" in the price tag of the package, which would extend Mr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts, boost border security spending, impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients and roll back clean energy tax credits.",
      "Musk left his position in the administration on May 30 after reaching the maximum number of days he could serve as a special government employee. Musk, who had a black eye, stood next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president praised the billionaire's government work and called him \"one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced.\"",
      "\"Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling,\" Mr. Trump said. Musk said he would continue to serve as a \"friend and adviser\" to the president.",
      "Musk-Trump spat bursts wide open",
      "In the following days, Musk escalated his criticism of the legislation Mr. Trump has dubbed a \"big, beautiful bill,\" calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" in a lengthy early June tirade on his social media platform. The insults continued through the week, reaching a climax on June 5 with Mr. Trump threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him.",
      "Musk said he would shut down a SpaceX program that NASA relies on to transport astronauts \u2014 before later backtracking \u2014 and seemed to endorse an X post calling for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Musk also warned Republican lawmakers: \"Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years.\"",
      "During the back-and-forth, Mr. Trump claimed that he asked Musk to leave his administration and upset him with a provision in the budget bill that would end tax credits for electric vehicles.",

      "Washington \u2014 The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk broke down in dramatic and public fashion on Thursday, with the president threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him, fueling a feud that erupted over Musk's opposition to Republicans' tax and budget bill.",
      "In the afternoon, Musk dropped what he called \"the really big bomb,\" alleging that Mr. Trump's name appeared in the files related to the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking. \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Have a nice day, DJT!\"",
      "Trump officials vowed to unveil more files related to the Epstein case when the administration took power. In February, the Justice Department issued a limited release of unredacted versions of files that had been public for years, a move that was met with criticism by conservatives who have demanded more transparency.",
      "Mr. Trump soon responded with another post of his own: \"I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.\"",
      "Musk also expressed support for a post that said Mr. Trump should be impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The break between the president and the world's richest man originated over Musk's ongoing criticism of Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" on Capitol Hill, which cuts taxes by trillions of dollars and implements Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in spending. Musk has railed against the legislation as \"outrageous\" and \"a disgusting abomination.\" The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated\u00a0on Wednesday that the bill would lead to an increase of $2.4 trillion in total deficits over the next 10 years, a conclusion that Republicans and Mr. Trump dispute.",
      "\"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday evening. \"The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.\"",
      "\"I'm very disappointed in Elon\"",

      "\"Elon and I had a great relationship,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"I don't know if we will anymore.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Musk, the CEO of Tesla, was around for the whole process of crafting the bill. The president claimed he \"never had a problem\" with the legislation until provisions dealing with electric vehicle subsidies were eliminated, threatening Tesla's business. The bill would roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, phasing out a tax break for clean energy vehicles.",
      "\"I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, adding that Musk \"worked hard\" and did a \"good job.\"",
      "\"And I'll be honest, I think he misses the place,\" the president continued. \"He's not the first. People leave my administration and they love us. And then, at some point, they miss it so badly. And some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it.\"",
      "\"Without me, Trump would have lost the election\"...\"Such ingratitude\"",
      "Appearing to respond to Mr. Trump's comments in real time, Musk wrote on X: \"Whatever.   Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.\" In another post, he denied that he was aware of the details in the bill when it was crafted, writing that \"this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!\"",
      "\"Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\" Musk\u00a0went on. \"Such ingratitude,\" he added.",

      "Vice President JD Vance, meanwhile, expressed support for Mr. Trump, saying on X late Thursday he is \"proud to stand beside him\" in a post that did not name Musk.",
      "The president's comments expressing disappointment with Musk were a swift about-face. Less than a week ago, Mr. Trump\u00a0gifted Musk a key to the White House as an expression of gratitude for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk wrapped up his time in the federal government Friday, as he reached the maximum amount of days he could serve as a special government employee.",
      "Mr. Trump said then that Musk was \"really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling.\"",

NASA has paid SpaceX billions over the last decade to ferry astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station.

Some analysts \u2014 and possibly Musk \u2014 think an end to electric car credits would hurt Tesla's rivals more than Tesla.

      "Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, sent a letter to Dr. Kevin O'Connor on Thursday subpoenaing him to testify at a June 27 deposition. He said the committee wants details about \"your assessment of and relationship with former President Biden.\"",
      "House Oversight had requested last month that O'Conner appear for a transcribed interview, Comer wrote, but the doctor's attorneys declined, citing local laws and medical ethics rules that generally discourage physicians from disclosing confidential information about their patients. Comer wrote that those \"arguments lack merit.\"",
      "The letter to O'Conner said the committee \"sought to understand if you contributed to an effort to hide former President Biden's fitness to serve from the American people.\"",
      "It cited a memo penned by O'Conner last year after Biden's physical, describing the then-president as a \"healthy, active, robust 81-year-old male, who remains fit to successfully execute the duties of the Presidency.\"",
      "O'Connor's lawyers, David Schertler and Mark MacDougall, said in a statement to CBS News: \"We just received the correspondence and subpoena from the House Oversight Committee this afternoon.\u00a0 We will review it carefully and respond to Chairman Comer after we have had a chance to do so.\"",
      "Comer's inquiry into Biden's health has expanded in recent days, as new reporting emerges on Biden's mental acuity while in office and the circumstances of Biden's withdrawal from the 2024 presidential election. Comer sent letters earlier this week asking five members of Biden's inner circle \u2014 Ron Klain, Michael Donilon, Bruce Reed, Steve Richetti and Anita Dunn \u2014 to testify about the former president's \"mental and physical faculties.\"",

      "Four Guyanese nationals \u2014 Paul Daby Jr., Randolph Duncan, Mark Cromwell, Himnauth Sawh \u2014   and two Colombians \u2014   Yeison Andres Sanchez Vallejo and Manuel Salazar Gutierrez \u2014   were sanctioned for allegedly trafficking tons of cocaine from South America to the United States, Europe and the Caribbean, officials said.",
      "Daby Jr. and Duncan operate the largest drug trafficking operation in Guayana, according to U.S. officials, using \"narco subs\" \u2014  a semi-submersible vessel that can't fully go underwater \u2014   airstrips and various individuals in their smuggling efforts. Daby Jr. also transports illegal gold from Guyana, while Duncan traffics cocaine from Guyana to Africa and the Caribbean to Europe and the United States, the Treasury said.",
      "The Treasury Department said Cromwell, a former Guyana police officer, is wanted for his alleged role in the abduction of another Guyana police officer in 2024. Sawh, a Guyana police officer, is accused of facilitating safe passage for Mexican and Venezuelan drug traffickers sending cocaine through Guyana. Colombians Sanchez and Salazar are accused of overseeing airstrips used by aircraft smuggling cocaine from Colombia to Guyana, the Treasury said.",

    "summary": "Arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Trump's second term topped 100,000 this week.",
    "story": [
      "Arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Trump's second term topped 100,000 this week, as federal agents intensified efforts to detain unauthorized immigrants in courthouses, worksites and communities across the U.S., internal government data obtained by CBS News shows.",
      "On Tuesday and Wednesday, ICE recorded more than 2,000 arrests each day, a dramatic increase from the daily average of 660 arrests reported by the agency during Mr. Trump's first 100 days back at the White House, the federal statistics show. During President Biden's last year in office, ICE averaged roughly 300 daily arrests, according to agency data.",
      "The latest numbers show ICE is getting closer to meeting the far-reaching demands of top administration officials like White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner who has forcefully pushed the agency to conduct \"a minimum\" of 3,000 arrests each day.",
      "On Thursday morning, ICE was holding around 54,000 immigrant detainees in detention facilities across the country, according to the data. The Trump administration is asking Congress to give ICE billions of dollars in extra funds to hire thousands of additional deportation officers and expand detention capacity to hold 100,000 individuals at any given point. Officials are also looking at converting facilities inside military bases into immigration detention centers.",
      "The marked increase in ICE arrests across the country \u2014 especially in major Democratic-led cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration officials \u2014 comes after the Trump administration replaced two of the agency's top leaders amid internal frustrations that arrest numbers were not high enough.",
      "CBS News reached out to the representatives for ICE and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials have framed the aggressive expansion of immigration operations as necessary to fulfill the president's signature campaign promises of cracking down on illegal immigration, expelling immigrants with criminal histories and overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history.",
      "But to boost arrest numbers, ICE has resorted to more aggressive \u2014 and controversial \u2014 tactics that have triggered outrage and even confrontations in some communities.",
      "Those efforts include arrests of migrants and asylum-seekers showing up to court hearings or check-in appointments that the government instructed them to attend. Immigration lawyers have strongly denounced those arrests, saying they deter migrants from complying with the legal process. Immigration roundups at some worksites have also been reported recently.",
      "Videos of some ICE arrests have depicted sobbing women and children being escorted into vehicles outside of immigration courts. Footage has also captured community members confronting federal agents \u2014 some of them masked \u2014 as they take migrants into custody. One video showed construction workers suspected of being in the U.S. illegally lined up after an ICE-led operation on their worksite in Florida.",
      "And while ICE has been arresting many immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and also have criminal records, the agency is simultaneously detaining non-criminal migrants living in the U.S. without proper documents \u2014 including longstanding residents \u2014 amid the Trump administration's pressure to increase arrest levels.",
      "Among them is Marcelo Gomes, an 18-year-old Brazilian-born high school student in Milford, Massachusetts, who was arrested by ICE last week on his way to volleyball practice. While ICE has acknowledged that agents were looking for his father when they arrested Gomes, it nevertheless transferred the teenager to a detention center, saying he's in the U.S. illegally. Gomes' lawyer said her client initially lived in the U.S. on a temporary visa that had since lapsed. On Thursday, Gomes was released from ICE custody after an immigration judge granted him bond.",
      "Before Mr. Trump took office, someone like Gomes would likely not have been arrested by ICE, given his age, his lack of any criminal record and the fact that he came to the U.S. as a child over a decade ago.",
      "But the Trump administration has reversed Biden-era restrictions on ICE operations that directed the agency to largely focus on detaining serious criminals, recent arrivals and national security threats, like suspected terrorists. Trump administration officials have said the Biden-era directives forced ICE agents to ignore federal immigration law.",
      "While ICE employees have spearheaded Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, the agency is receiving support from other federal agencies as part of an unprecedented effort by the administration to muster manpower and resources from across the government for immigration enforcement.",
      "The federal agencies now helping ICE arrest unauthorized immigrants include Customs and Border Protection; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Internal Revenue Service. The Trump administration has also enlisted local and state law enforcement officials in friendly jurisdictions like Florida to support ICE operations.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday revived a lawsuit from an\u00a0Ohio woman\u00a0who claimed she was the victim of reverse discrimination because her employer denied her a promotion because she is straight.",
      "In a unanimous decision\u00a0in the case of Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, the high court tossed out a ruling by a federal appeals court that dismissed Marlean Ames' claims because she failed to clear a higher bar applied to members of a majority group in order for her employment discrimination case to proceed. The justices concluded that a \"background circumstances\" requirement cannot be squared with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and sent Ames' case back to the lower courts for further proceedings.",
      "The background circumstances rule required plaintiffs who are members of a majority group to put forth more evidence showing that their employer is \"unusual\" because it discriminates against the majority. Ames had argued that the requirement unfairly imposed a higher burden on her as a heterosexual woman.",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court makes it easier to pursue claims of reverse discrimination in 20 states and the District of Columbia that are covered by federal courts of appeals that still applied the standard.",
      "Writing for the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said that the Supreme Court's case law \"makes clear that the standard for proving disparate treatment under Title VII does not vary based on whether or not the plaintiff is a member of a majority group. ... The 'background circumstances' rule flouts that basic principle.\"",
      "Jackson noted that the requirement uniformly subjects all majority-group plaintiffs to \"the same, highly specific evidentiary standard in every case.\"",
      "Ames sued her employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, after she said she was turned down for a promotion in favor of a gay woman and then demoted and replaced by a gay man. She alleged violations of Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace based on race, religion, national origin and sex, which includes sexual orientation. Ames accused the department of discriminating against her on the basis of sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court ruled for the Ohio Department of Youth Services after finding that it offered \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons\" for passing Ames over for the promotion. The court concluded that Ames' allegations were insufficient to establish the background circumstances necessary to make an initial case of reverse discrimination.",
      "A plaintiff can clear that bar if they put forward evidence that a member of the relevant minority group made the employment decision at issue, or by presenting statistical evidence demonstrating a pattern of discrimination by the employer against members of a majority group.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld the district court's decision and agreed that Ames failed to satisfy the background circumstances requirement.",
      "Ames appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed in October to review the 6th Circuit's decision. That appeals court and four others \u2014 the 7th, 8th, 10th and D.C. Circuits \u2014 still applied the background circumstances standard, while seven others do not.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, criticized the background circumstances rule as \"judge-made\" and said it is \"undoubtedly\" contrary to Title VII and likely violates the Constitution.",
      "\"Courts with this rule have enshrined into Title VII's anti-discrimination law an explicitly race-based preference: White plaintiffs must prove the existence of background circumstances, while nonwhite plaintiffs need not do so,\" Thomas wrote.",
      "He said that the Supreme Court's decision \"obviates the need for courts to engage in the 'sordid business'\" of dividing people by race or other protected traits.",
      "The dispute arrived before the high court as President Trump targeted diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and practices throughout the federal government and fired federal employees in DEI roles. Large companies, too, dismantled their DEI policies following the Supreme Court's 2023 decision that ended affirmative action in college admissions.",

      "Mr. Trump said the list could be revised if countries make \"material improvements,\" and new countries could be added \"as threats emerge around the world.\"",
      "Did Trump do this before?",
      "The president's actions follow a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits, although the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the revised ban from his first term, which the White House noted in a fact sheet outlining his second-term bans.",

      "\"In my first term, my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies, and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban sparked widespread outcry, creating chaos at airports and prompting legal challenges, as opponents argued the ban was discriminatory.",
      "Then in March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. The president expanded the ban in 2020, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.",
      "The third iteration of the president's first-term ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018.

Harvard\u00a0challenged the move in court, and on Thursday a federal judge\u00a0temporarily blocked the policy from going into effect.",
      "In a proclamation, Mr. Trump suspended the entry of foreign students or exchange visitors planning to go to Harvard, unless his administration determines somebody's entry \"would be in the national interest.\" The order also directs Secretary of State Marco Rubio to consider whether student visa holders who are already in the U.S. \"should have their visas revoked.\" The order will expire in six months, though an extension is possible.",
      "The order claimed Harvard \"is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs,\" accusing the school of failing to report students' disciplinary records to the federal government and criticizing it for ties to researchers based in China.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson called the order \"yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights.\"",
      "\"Harvard will continue to protect its international students,\" the spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration has tried repeatedly to restrict Harvard's ability to enroll international students \u2014 a serious threat for a school where more than one in four students hail from foreign countries.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security tried to take away Harvard's certification in the federal government's student visa database. A judge halted that policy after Harvard sued, with the school arguing the order was unconstitutional and would have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",
      "And last week, the State Department ordered embassies and consulates to conduct \"additional vetting\" of anybody who wants to travel to Harvard \u2014 including current and prospective students, faculty, guest speakers and even tourists \u2014 according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "The Trump administration has feuded with Harvard for months, seeking to cut off billions in federal funding. The funding cutoffs came after\u00a0the school rejected the government's demands to change its disciplinary practices, end diversity, equity and inclusion programs and commission an external audit of some academic departments.",
      "The government has sharply criticized Harvard's handling of pro-Palestinian protests and alleged the school has failed to deal with antisemitism on campus. But Harvard argues it is being punished for First Amendment-protected speech.",
      "The administration has cracked down on international students beyond Harvard. It halted new student visa interviews last week in preparation for \"expanded social media vetting,\" and the State Department's email directing extra vetting for travelers to Harvard framed the policy as a \"pilot\" for other visa applicants.",
      "Meanwhile, thousands of foreign students who are already present in the U.S. have faced the termination of their student visa status, sometimes after appearing to get on the government's radar due to minor legal issues \u2014 though a judge blocked that policy.",
      "And some international students with links to pro-Palestinian activism have been detained under a rarely used law allowing visas to be revoked if someone's presence in the U.S. poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Judges ordered the release of two students on bond \u2014 Columbia University's Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk \u2014 but another Columbia activist, Mahmoud Khalil, remains detained.",

    "summary": "A private lunar lander from Tokyo-based company ispace was aiming for a touchdown in the unexplored far north with a mini rover.",
    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese lander attempted to touch down on the moon Thursday, but telemetry indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity moments before communications were lost. The data suggested a mission-ending crash landing.",
      "\"Based on the currently available data, the Mission Control Center has been able to confirm the following: The laser rangefinder used to measure the distance to the lunar surface experienced delays in obtaining valid measurement values,\" ispace, builder of the Resilience lander, said in a statement.",
      "\"As a result, the lander was unable to decelerate sufficiently to reach the required speed for the planned lunar landing. Based on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface.\"",
      "After unsuccessful attempts to re-establish communications, flight controllers in Tokyo uplinked commands to reboot the Resilience lander's flight computer. But there was no response.",
      "\"Given that there is currently no prospect of a successful lunar landing, our top priority is to swiftly analyze the telemetry data we have obtained thus far and work diligently to identify the cause,\" said ispace founder and CEO Takeshi Hakamada.",
      "\"We will strive to restore trust by providing a report of the findings to our shareholders, payload customers, (mission) partners, government officials and all supporters of ispace.\"",
      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "summary": "Two Chinese researchers were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The fungus labeled a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" in a recent arrest touted by the Trump administration likely originated in North America and is already widely prevalent around the country, a researcher who studied the fungus for the federal government says.",
      "University of Michigan researcher Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States. Jian worked at the University of Michigan, according to officials, and Liu works at a Chinese university. The two have co-authored research into the fungus.",
      "\"I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Tuesday in a post\u00a0on X.",
      "According to charging documents in the case, Liu told customs officers he was trying to continue his research with the strains at the University of Michigan lab that Jian worked in, skirting the rules that require paperwork and safeguards to safely import fungi for studies.",
      "F. graminearum is already widely prevalent across the U.S. in native grasses around the country as well as crops, scientists say. It spreads and thrives usually during wet weather, causing a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.",
      "\"It's extremely prevalent in North America. It likely arose in North America, so it's not like a foreign agent coming in. And it's already causing a lot of problems in U.S. agriculture,\" Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told CBS News.",
      "Kistler said scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America because all of its closest relatives have been found on the continent.",
      "\"Graminearum itself is distributed worldwide, and likely because of the distribution of grain from North America worldwide,\" he said.",
      "Kistler previously worked as a researcher for the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studying fungi like F. graminearum and the crop disease it causes. While at the agency, he co-authored research with Liu and Jian uncovering new molecular clues to how the disease might be mitigated.",
      "\"It's a real problem. The problem is because there's no naturally occurring resistance to the disease. And people have been trying for decades to find resistance. It's just a tough nut to crack,\" Kistler said of the head blight caused by F. graminearum.",
      "Farmers in the U.S. rely on a number of methods to mitigate the risk of F. graminearum, including the use of fungicides, though scientists have worried about the possibility of mutations that could make the fungicides less effective.",
      "\"The fungicides are not cheap. So it's extra cost to farmers. But it's worth it because, without it, their crops could be completely lost. Not only due to yield reduction, but because what grain they may have would be contaminated with these toxins,\" Kistler said.",
      "Billions of dollars were lost to epidemics caused by the fungus in the 1990s, researchers and agriculture officials estimate. The Food and Drug Administration monitors for the toxins that are produced by fungi like F. graminearum, including deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin or DON, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in humans who ingest too much of it.",
      "\"It is not possible to completely avoid the presence of DON in wheat. DON is sometimes found in wheat grown under normal weather conditions, however, the fungus thrives in cool, wet conditions,\" the FDA said in a 2010 advisory to states and grain groups.",
      "Kistler said U.S. distributors also test grain for the presence of the toxins to prevent there being too much of it in the food supply.",
      "\"If it's too high, they will reject it. They won't buy it. Or they will reduce the amount that they'll pay for it. If it's just marginal, they can blend it with grain that doesn't have the toxin to get below the limit of what's considered safe,\" he said.",

    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",

      "What is the Air Quality Index?",
      "The Air Quality Index is used nationwide to measure the severity of air pollution and categorize the health risks that are involved with various levels of pollution. The index uses six color-coded categories: good (green), moderate (yellow), unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange), unhealthy (red), very unhealthy (purple) and hazardous (maroon).",
      "The health impacts included in the index are those that people are likely to experience within \"a few hours or days\" after being exposed to the air, the National Weather Service Says.",
      "How is air quality measured?",
      "The National Weather Service says that the Environmental Protection Agency calculates the Air Quality Index \u2014 a value between 0 and 500 \u2014 based on five \"major pollutants.\"",
      "Those pollutants \u2014 ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2014 are all regulated by the Clean Air Act. Of those, ground-level ozone and airborne particles are considered \"the greatest threat to human health.\"",
      "What do the numbers mean?",
      "Each Air Quality Index category, also known as the level of concern, is attached to a certain range of values:",
      "Good (green): 0 to 50Moderate (yellow): 51 to 100Unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange): 101 to 150Unhealthy (red): 151 to 200\u00a0Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300\u00a0Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",

      "Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300",
      "Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",
      "Essentially, the lower the number, the cleaner the air. The only category where air quality is considered \"satisfactory\" is the one where the index value is no more than 50, although values between 51 and 100 are still considered \"acceptable.\" After that, the air could pose a risk to at least some people, and that risk only becomes greater as the index value rises.",
      "Once the air is deemed \"very unhealthy,\" the general public is at risk of experiencing health impacts, which range from a headache and fatigue to much more serious issues such as heart attack or stroke. At \"hazardous\" levels, the region is experiencing an air quality emergency. Those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are more at risk of developing serious health issues as pollution worsens.",
      "What is the air quality near me?",
      "Air Quality Index values change constantly throughout the day as weather conditions and weather patterns move through the area. The map below automatically updates to show air quality conditions nationwide.",
      "The EPA's\u00a0AirNow.gov site uses the index to provide the latest status for your area. To use the site, enter your ZIP code and a meter will pop up showing you what the value and color category is for your city, as well as the last time that measurement was updated.",
      "It also tells you what pollutant is causing issues, who is most at risk for health complications and what activities may be safe to do.",
      "In Minneapolis, for example, the reading on Tuesday morning, June 3, said the AQI for PM2.5, a kind of particulate matter, is 203, meaning \"very unhealthy,\" and that people who have heart or lung disease, those who are elderly, and children and teens should avoid outdoor physical activity.

      "The landing attempt came two years after ispace's first lander malfunctioned during the final stages of its descent to the moon, making a similar hard landing. But Hakamada said it was too early to establish any common cause and that engineers needed more time to analyze the telemetry that made it back to Earth.",
      "Carrying cameras, a few science payloads, a tiny rover and even an art project, Resilience   fired its thrusters just after 2:10 p.m. EDT to begin the 66-minute descent from a 62-mile-high circular orbit to touchdown near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "All appeared to be going smoothly when, around 3:17 p.m. \u2014 the projected landing time \u2014 telemetry suddenly ceased. The last data received indicated a higher-than-expected descent velocity and an altitude of 630 feet above the surface.",
      "\"At this moment, we have not yet been able to establish communication with Resilience, but ispace engineers in our Mission Control Center are continuing to work to contact the lander,\" the company posted on X just after 5 p.m.",
      "\"We will share an update with the latest information in a media announcement in the next few hours. Thank you for your patience -- please check back with us soon.\" Three hours later, officials announced the landing failure during a news briefing.",
      "The primary goals of the mission were to land on the moon and deploy the small micro rover Tenacious. The rover, in turn, carried the art project, a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long, 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fundraising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" could survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint was expected to fade in the sun's harsh radiation, and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "Ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "Ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024, and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only Firefly Aerospace had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 62-mile circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:05:16 -0400",
    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",

      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",
      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\"Why is there a spiral there?\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum's educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\"It's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\" said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\" planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",
      "According to the planetarium, \"Encounters in the Milky Way\" \u2014 narrated by actor Pedro Pascal \u2014 is a \"a time-traveling journey about the cosmic movements that shape our galactic neighborhood.\"",
      "The film, a collaboration of astronomers and science visualization experts, pulls from data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission. The mission is called the \"billion-star survey\" as it aims to map the precise positions and motions of nearly 2 billion stars in our galaxy.",
      "The show opens to the public on Monday.",

      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",

      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive,\u00a0 upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",

      "The Belmont Stakes is set to host a rematch in New York on Saturday of the top three finishing horses from the Kentucky Derby to close out horse racing's Triple Crown for 2025.",
      "Five weeks after Sovereignty won the Derby over Journalism and Baeza, the three horses will be among the eight competing in the last race of the Triple Crown \u2014 the series for 3-year-olds consisting of the Derby, the Preakness Stakes and the Belmont. Sovereignty's connections chose to skip the Preakness in Baltimore to prepare for the Belmont, meaning no horse would win the Triple Crown this year.",
      "2025 Belmont Stakes horses and odds",
      "Journalism, who won the Preakness two weeks after coming in second at the Derby, was picked as the morning-line favorite for the Belmont with 8-5 odds. The odds will change as bettors place their wagers leading up to Saturday's approximate post time of 7:04 p.m. EDT. Here's a list of all the horses racing in the Belmont in order by their number with their morning-line odds:",
      "1. Hill Road, 10-12. Sovereignty, 2-13. Rodriguez, 6-14. Uncaged, 30-15. Crudo, 15-16. Baeza, 4-17. Journalism, 8-58. Heart of Honor, 30-1",
      "1. Hill Road, 10-1",
      "2. Sovereignty, 2-1",
      "3. Rodriguez, 6-1",
      "4. Uncaged, 30-1",
      "5. Crudo, 15-1",
      "6. Baeza, 4-1",
      "7. Journalism, 8-5",
      "8. Heart of Honor, 30-1",
      "The Belmont will be 1 1/4 miles long instead of the usual 1 1/2 miles, making the race known as the Test of the Champion the same length as the Derby. The change is because the Belmont is temporarily being held at Saratoga Race Course in Saratoga Springs, New York, about a 45-minute drive north of the state capital of Albany.",
      "\"Shame the Belmont is not a mile-and-a-half,\" said Heart of Honor's trainer, Jamie Osborne, according to a news release after the Preakness. The brown colt didn't have the best start, but passed four horses to finish fifth in the 1 3/16-mile race, the shortest of the Triple Crown races.",
      "The Belmont is expected to return to Long Island's Belmont Park next year after the completion of a massive redevelopment project.",
      "While the Triple Crown has been won twice in the past decade \u2014 with American Pharoah ending a 37-year drought in 2015 and Justify in 2018 \u2014 winning just the Preakness and the Belmont has become more of a novelty. It was last accomplished in 2005 by Afleet Alex, who finished third in the Derby.",
      "At the Preakness, Journalism barreled down the stretch to overcome Gosger and win by half a length at Pimlico Race Course. The bay colt was the morning-line favorite for the Preakness as well as the Derby, winning over oddsmakers with four straight victories in California, including April's Santa Anita Derby, March's San Felipe Stakes and December's Los Alamitos Futurity Stakes.",
      "Jockey Umberto Rispoli, who was aboard Journalism for those three races, the Preakness and the Derby, will have the mount again for the Belmont. Journalism's trainer, Michael McCarthy, has only had one other horse in the Belmont, Rombauer, who came in third in 2021.",
      "With 2-1 odds in the morning line, Sovereignty will try to achieve a rarer feat than winning just the Preakness and the Belmont: victories at the Derby and the Belmont. The last horse to do that was Thunder Gulch in 1995 after finishing third at the Preakness.",
      "While Sovereignty  skipped the Triple Crown's middle jewel, the bay colt wasn't completely out of the news. His jockey, Junior Alvarado, was fined $62,000 and suspended for two racing days in Kentucky by the state's Board of Stewards for allegedly using his riding crop too much in the Derby. Alvarado is appealing the decision.",
      "Alvarado will be riding Sovereignty on Saturday, which will be the jockey's fourth mount in the Belmont. Last year, he was aboard Resilience, who finished in 10th place and was trained by Bill Mott. The two have teamed up again with Sovereignty. Mott has trained a Belmont winner before \u2014 Drosselmeyer, who won in 2010.",
      "Sovereignty comes into the Belmont after finishing second at March's Florida Derby and winning the Fountain of Youth Stakes in Florida and October's Street Sense Stakes at Churchill Downs, the home of the Derby.",
      "Baeza didn't initially draw a post for the Derby and only entered the field when Rodriguez was scratched from the race two days before the Run for the Roses. He broke from the post on the far outside and came in third behind Journalism by a neck. Before the Derby, the bay colt came in second at the Santa Anita Derby, also behind Journalism.",
      "Baeza was given 4-1 morning-line odds for the Belmont and will be under Flavien Prat, who also had the mount in the Derby. Prat's been in the past four runnings of the Belmont, riding Hot Rod Charlie to second place in 2021. Trainer John Shirreffs has had three other horses in the Belmont, most recently Gormley, who came in fourth in 2017.",
      "Rodriguez was scratched from the Derby over what co-owner Tom Ryan described as a \"small but slightly sensitive foot bruise.\" Trainer Bob Baffert said the dark bay colt has healed and is performing as well as he was before he won the Wood Memorial Stakes in April at New York City's Aqueduct Racetrack, according to a New York Racing Association news release.",
      "Baffert has trained three Belmont winners: American Pharoah, Justify and Point Given, who won the race by 12 1/2 lengths in 2001. With 6-1 odds in the morning line, Rodriguez will be under Mike Smith, who's looking for his fourth Belmont win.",
      "Hill Road, who was given 10-1 morning-line odds for the Belmont, won the Peter Pan Stakes at Aqueduct last month and finished third in the Tampa Bay Derby in March and in November's Breeders' Cup Juvenile in California.",
      "Irad Ortiz Jr. will be aboard the bay colt in pursuit of his third Belmont win, most recently riding Mo Donegal to victory in 2022. Hill Road will be trainer Chad Brown's fifth career entry in the race. He's still seeking his first Belmont win after coming close with third-place Sierra Leone in 2024 and second-place Gronkowski in 2018.",
      "Crudo, who's co-owned by celebrity chef Bobby Flay, was given 15-1 odds in the morning line. The bay colt won the Sir Barton Stakes, one of the undercard races for the Preakness, and will be trainer Todd Pletcher's chance for a fifth Belmont win. John Velazquez will have the mount, going for his third victory at the race.",
      "Pletcher's second horse in the race, Uncaged, won at Saratoga in August and at Aqueduct in April but came in sixth at the Peter Pan. With 30-1 morning-line odds, the bay colt will be under Luis Saez, who won the Belmont with Dornoch last year and with Essential Quality in 2021.",
      "With Heart of Honor, the other horse to be given 30-1 odds in the morning line, Saffie Osborne has a chance to become the first woman to ride to victory in a Triple Crown race since Julie Krone won the Belmont in 1993 aboard Colonial Affair. In addition to finishing fifth at the Preakness, the British-bred brown colt raced in the United Arab Emirates, coming in second at the UAE Derby in April.",

      "Meta has removed a number of ads promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfakes using images of real people \u2014 after a CBS News investigation found hundreds of such advertisements on its platforms.",
      "\"We have strict rules against non-consensual intimate imagery; we removed these ads, deleted the Pages responsible for running them and permanently blocked the URLs associated with these apps,\" a Meta spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "CBS News uncovered dozens of those ads on Meta's Instagram platform, in its \"Stories\" feature, promoting AI tools that, in many cases, advertised the ability to \"upload a photo\" and \"see anyone naked.\" Other ads in Instagram's Stories promoted the ability to upload and manipulate videos of real people. One promotional ad even read \"how is this filter even allowed?\" as text underneath an example of a nude deepfake.",
      "One ad promoted its AI product by using highly sexualized, underwear-clad deepfake images of actors Scarlett Johansson and Anne Hathaway. Some of the ads ads' URL links redirect to websites that promote the ability to animate real people's images and get them to perform sex acts. And some of the applications charged users between $20 and $80 to access these \"exclusive\" and \"advance\" features. In other cases, an ad's URL redirected users to Apple's app store, where \"nudify\" apps were available to download.",
      "An analysis of the advertisements in Meta's ad library found that there were, at a minimum, hundreds of these ads available across the company's social media platforms, including on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, the Facebook Messenger application and Meta Audience Network \u2014 a platform that allows Meta advertisers to reach users on mobile apps and websites that partner with the company.",
      "According to Meta's own Ad Library data, many of these ads were specifically targeted at men between the ages of 18 and 65, and were active in the United States, European Union and United Kingdom.",
      "A Meta spokesperson told CBS News the spread of this sort of AI-generated content is an ongoing problem and they are facing increasingly sophisticated challenges in trying to combat it.",
      "\"The people behind these exploitative apps constantly evolve their tactics to evade detection, so we're continuously working to strengthen our enforcement,\" a Meta spokesperson said.",
      "CBS News found that ads for \"nudify\" deepfake tools were still available on the company's Instagram platform even after Meta had removed those initially flagged.",
      "Deepfakes are manipulated images, audio recordings, or videos of real people that have been altered with artificial intelligence to misrepresent someone as saying or doing something that the person did not actually say or do.",
      "Last month, President Trump signed into law the bipartisan \"Take It Down Act,\" which, among other things, requires websites and social media companies to remove deepfake content within 48 hours of notice from a victim.",
      "Although the law makes it illegal to \"knowingly publish\" or threaten to publish intimate images without a person's consent, including AI-created deepfakes, it does not target the tools used to create such AI-generated content.",
      "Those tools do violate platform safety and moderation rules implemented by both Apple and Meta on their respective platforms.",
      "Meta's advertising standards policy says, \"ads must not contain adult nudity and sexual activity. This includes nudity, depictions of people in explicit or sexually suggestive positions, or activities that are sexually suggestive.\"",
      "Under Meta's \"bullying and harassment\" policy, the company also prohibits \"derogatory sexualized photoshop or drawings\" on its platforms. The company says its regulations are intended to block users from sharing or threatening to share nonconsensual intimate imagery.",
      "Apple's guidelines for its app store explicitly state that \"content that is offensive, insensitive,\u00a0 upsetting, intended to disgust, in exceptionally poor taste, or just plain creepy\" is banned.",
      "Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust, and Safety Initiative at Cornell University's tech research center, has been studying the surge in AI deepfake networks marketing on social platforms for more than a year. He told CBS News in a phone interview on Tuesday that he'd seen thousands more of these ads across Meta platforms, as well as on platforms such as X and Telegram, during that period.",
      "Although Telegram and X have what he described as a structural \"lawlessness\" that allows for this sort of content, he believes Meta's leadership lacks the will to address the issue, despite having content moderators in place.",
      "\"I do think that trust and safety teams at these companies care. I don't think, frankly, that they care at the very top of the company in Meta's case,\" he said. \"They're clearly under-resourcing the teams that have to fight this stuff, because as sophisticated as these [deepfake] networks are \u2026 they don't have Meta money to throw at it.\"",
      "Mantzarlis also said that he found in his research that \"nudify\" deepfake generators are available to download on both Apple's app store and Google's Play store, expressing frustration with these massive platforms' inability to enforce such content.",
      "\"The problem with apps is that they have this dual-use front where they present on the app store as a fun way to face swap, but then they are marketing on Meta as their primary purpose being nudification.

    "published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 05:00:05 -0400",
    "summary": "The organizers of prominent Pride celebrations saw huge sponsorship drop-offs this year, a pattern seen as a response to the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "The architects of Pride celebrations across the United States met six-figure challenges this year, owing to a corporate exodus in the spring that diminished their sponsorship funds, which they said would jeopardize future programming. Organizers are contending with serious budget shortfalls as Pride Month begins, and several reported 20% to 30% less corporate support than in past years.",
      "The show will go on this summer, they said, but what happens next is less certain.",
      "\"We're going to make it to the event,\" said Suzanne Ford, the executive director of San Francisco Pride, who told CBS News five corporate sponsors cut ties with the organization over the course of one overwhelming week in March and several others reduced their funding. \"The real question now is, what kind of shape are we going to be in on the other side of Pride? Are we going to be able to keep the doors open?\"",
      "Corporate partners that backed out of San Francisco Pride this year were historically among its largest and most reliable donors, including Nissan Comcast/Xfinity and Bud Light's parent company, Anheuser-Busch. Along with Target, Bud Light has faced public backlash and boycotts over its Pride advertising in recent years.",
      "\"That hurt us greatly,\" Ford said of losing Anheuser-Busch, previously \"one of the very largest\" sponsors of San Francisco Pride. \"Comcast and Nissan have been significant and have been longtime partners. They've been with us for a long time, so it was money that we've counted on.\"",
      "Their retreats meant San Francisco Pride was operating at a loss of about $300,000, which Ford hopes will shrink to about $200,000 once increased donations are factored in from other sponsors, who raised their pledges to narrow the gaps left by the bigger brands. Two large corporate partners, Benefit Cosmetics and La Crema, initially dropped their sponsorship contracts but have since returned as partners, Ford said.",
      "Several brands that stepped back from Pride partnerships in San Francisco have done the same in other cities. Anheuser-Busch, known for decades as a supporter of the LGBTQ community, also declined to sponsor the 2025 Pride Festival in its hometown of St. Louis,\u00a0according to that event's organizers. The company had been one of their leading sponsors for the last 30 years, the organizer's said.",
      "Pride Month was originally conceived as a way to commemorate the 1969 Stonewall riots, which are credited with kick-starting the modern gay rights movement, and it has evolved since then into a multifaceted celebration of the LGBTQ community. Local Pride plans typically involve multiday event rosters with at least one march, parade or festival, which are intermittently known to draw a million or more attendees.",
      "Celebrations around Pride grew tremendously over the last decade or so, organizers say, in large part because of an influx of corporate sponsorships cropping up after the U.S. legalized marriage equality in 2015. The upward trend in brand support was so steep for a period of time that some sponsors were\u00a0accused of exploiting LGBTQ issues\u00a0for the purpose of turning a profit.",
      "That trend looked very different this year, as corporate sponsors around the country either withdrew their support for Pride festivities or significantly scaled it back. Many attributed their decisions to financial strain or internal transitions, according to statements from several companies and organizers who recalled their conversations to CBS News.",
      "\"Nissan is currently reviewing all marketing and sales spending \u2014 including select consumer auto shows, sports properties and other entertainment activations \u2014 to maximize both efficiency and breakthrough effectiveness,\" a Nissan spokesperson said of the brand breaking partnerships with Pride organizers in San Francisco as well as New York City.",
      "But organizers and supporters see a pattern in the sponsorship cancellations, which some consider implicit byproducts of the Trump administration's\u00a0anti-DEI policies and ongoing\u00a0attacks on transgender Americans. Ron de Harte, the co-president of the Board of Directors at USA Prides, a national network of Pride organizations, said the decline in national brand sponsorships for Pride events is widespread this year.",
      "\"This is happening with festival and event sponsorships across the board,\" said de Harte in a statement. \"Of course, bad economic times are coupled with the current administration's unfriendly actions toward the LGBTQ communities, so some markets have sponsors who have moved on.\"",
      "As the Capital Pride Alliance organized WorldPride this year in Washington, D.C., it grappled with a litany of complications leading up to this weekend's international gathering. After President Trump took over the Kennedy Center, multiple WorldPride events were either canceled or relocated under new leadership. In addition, the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton, a major federal contractor, backed out of its 2025 WorldPride contract in a move that critics thought bent to government pressure.",
      "A spokesperson for Capital Pride Alliance said Booz Allen was the only WorldPride sponsor that canceled a finalized contract, but others dropped out in various stages of the sponsorship process, including Comcast/Xfinity, Deloitte and Visa. The spokesperson said some brands became \"silent partners,\" which means they donate in the background but avoid the publicity that can come with outright sponsorship.",
      "Matt Cheng, the director of corporate sponsorships at Heritage of Pride, the nonprofit that produces New York City Pride events, told CBS News that its corporate partners gave various explanations for decreasing or eliminating support. Economic weariness was among them, he said, along with fear of retaliation.",
      "\"One of the big ones is the tariffs and economy. A lot of budgets have gotten slashed from a DEI and marketing perspective,\" he said. \"But then the other one is fear of backlash from the federal government.\"",
      "Heritage of Pride lost roughly one-quarter of its sponsorship dollars, or about $750,000, in the last few months. Large companies like Deutsche Bank ramped up their earlier donations to organizations because of the shortfall, and a poll of about 100 individual donors recently gave $10,000 or so, Cheng said. He hoped New York City Pride fundraisers would bring them closer to zero losses.",
      "\"In addition to reviewing our budget lines to make sure we can afford to put on Pride the way that it typically is put on, our other concern is our year-round programming,\" he said.",
      "More immediately, a 25% budget gap would likely require Heritage of Pride to cut their only two grant programs, both of which support at-risk communities, Cheng added.",
      "Like San Francisco, St. Louis and WorldPride in D.C., New York City Pride also lost large sponsors. Nissan and PepsiCo both pulled support from Heritage of Pride after previously being top donors, according to public partnership information released last year and Kevin Kilbride, the media and marketing manager at the nonprofit. Other sponsors have reduced their funding but are still planning to march in the upcoming Manhattan parade, Kilbride said.",
      "Target has remained a silent partner of New York City Pride. Kilbride said Target continues to be \"a valued partner\" and its sponsorship this year was \"at a level consistent with years' past.\"",
      "\"We are absolutely dedicated to fostering inclusivity for everyone \u2014 our team members, our guests, our supply partners, and the more than 2,000 communities we're proud to serve,\" a Target spokesperson said in a statement. \"As we have for many years, we will continue to mark Pride Month by offering an assortment of celebratory products, hosting internal programming to support our incredible team and sponsoring local events in neighborhoods across the country.\"",

      "The alliance between President Trump and Elon Musk went up in flames Thursday, days after the world's richest man left the administration and tried to wield his influence to kill a massive budget bill that is central to enacting the president's top legislative priorities.",
      "Their spat played out in public and marked another remarkable turn for Musk, who spent tens of millions on Mr. Trump's reelection campaign and was given the reins to slash the size of the federal government.",
      "Here's a look back at how Mr. Trump and Musk got here:",
      "Trump \"not the right guy,\" Musk says in 2016",
      "The Tesla CEO praised Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies as \"the right ones\" in an interview with CNBC before the 2016 election.",
      "\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy,\" Musk said of Mr. Trump at the time. \"He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States.\"",
      "\"I don't think this is the finest moment in our democracy,\" Musk added.",
      "Musk joins \u2014 and quits \u2014 Trump administration roles",
      "Shortly after Mr. Trump's first term began, Musk joined a handful of White House advisory boards, including Mr. Trump's \"manufacturing jobs council.\"",
      "But Musk left those roles just months later, citing Mr. Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accords.",
      "\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk tweeted in June 2017.",
      "Musk continued to have a close relationship with the federal government, however, as his rocket company SpaceX has billions in contracts with NASA and other agencies.",
      "Mr. Trump praised Musk at a 2020 SpaceX launch in Florida, saying at one point: \"I speak to him all the time. Great guy. He's one of our great brains. We like great brains. And Elon has done a fantastic job.\"",
      "Musk sours on Democrats in 2022 \u2014 but still feuds with Trump",
      "In May 2022, Musk said he was ending his support for Democrats because \"they have become the party of division & hate.\"",
      "\"So I can no longer support them and will vote Republican,\" Musk tweeted, later adding that he voted for Clinton in 2016 and former President Joe Biden in 2020.",
      "But just two months later, Musk suggested he didn't support Mr. Trump launching another run for the White House amid a public spat with the then-former president over the course of several days in July 2022. Mr. Trump called the Tesla CEO a \"b---s--- artist\" at a rally and said his companies would be \"worthless\" without federal backing, while Musk tweeted Mr. Trump should \"hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.\"",
      "Later in 2022, Musk purchased Twitter, now known as X, and quickly reinstated Mr. Trump's account, which had been suspended since the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The reinstatement came four days after Mr. Trump announced his third run for the presidency after losing to Biden.",
      "In the Republican presidential primary, Musk initially threw his support behind one of Mr. Trump's rivals, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. In May 2023, the billionaire and the Floridian appeared together on a glitchy Twitter livestream to launch DeSantis' campaign.",

      "\"I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery,\" Musk wrote alongside video of the bloodied presidential candidate raising his fist in the air as he was surrounded by Secret Service agents.",
      "Musk joined Mr. Trump on the campaign trail and spent roughly $277 million to help elect him and other Republican candidates, mostly through a Musk-backed super PAC called America PAC, campaign finance records show.",
      "Mr. Trump shouted Musk out during his election night victory speech: \"A star is born,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He's an amazing guy.\"",
      "Before Mr. Trump was inaugurated for a second term, Musk used his political influence in December 2024 to whip up outrage against a bipartisan spending bill and torpedo it days before a potential government shutdown.",
      "Musk joins Trump administration, spearheading DOGE",
      "Mr. Trump appointed Musk to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was tasked with cutting federal government spending, but fell far short of Musk's $1 trillion goal.",
      "Musk quickly became a member of Mr. Trump's inner circle, participating in Cabinet meetings and traveling on Air Force One with his young son. Less than a month into his government service, Musk professed\u00a0on X: \"I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.\"",
      "DOGE quickly gained vast influence within the Trump administration, slashing government staff and nearly dismantling some federal agencies.",
      "Musk and Mr. Trump appeared together in the Oval Office in February \u2014 with Musk's son in tow \u2014 and jointly answered questions from the press.",
      "Mr. Trump stood by Musk as some of his efforts drew backlash. In late February, a DOGE-backed email telling federal employees to report what they had accomplished in the preceding week sparked confusion in some agencies. During a Cabinet meeting days later, Mr. Trump called Musk \"tremendously successful\" and said people were \"thrilled\" with his performance \u2014 and said federal workers who haven't responded to the emails are \"on the bubble.\"",
      "When Tesla faced protests from Trump opponents, the president boosted Musk, climbing into a Tesla on the White House South Lawn in March and calling the car \"beautiful.\" Days prior, Mr. Trump said on Truth Social he would \"buy a brand new Tesla\" as a show of support for Musk, who the president said was \"doing a FANTASTIC JOB.\"",
      "Musk clashed with White House trade adviser Peter Navarro in April over Mr. Trump's tariff strategy. Musk called Navarro \"dumber than a sack of bricks\" after Navarro said Tesla relies on \"cheap foreign parts.\" Mr. Trump's White House didn't take sides: \"Boys will be boys,\" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",

Musk told \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" he was \"disappointed\" in the price tag of the package, which would extend Mr. Trump's signature 2017 tax cuts, boost border security spending, impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients and roll back clean energy tax credits.",
      "Musk left his position in the administration on May 30 after reaching the maximum number of days he could serve as a special government employee. Musk, who had a black eye, stood next to Mr. Trump in the Oval Office as the president praised the billionaire's government work and called him \"one of the greatest business leaders and innovators the world has ever produced.\"",
      "\"Elon's really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling,\" Mr. Trump said. Musk said he would continue to serve as a \"friend and adviser\" to the president.",
      "Musk-Trump spat bursts wide open",
      "In the following days, Musk escalated his criticism of the legislation Mr. Trump has dubbed a \"big, beautiful bill,\" calling it a \"disgusting abomination\" in a lengthy early June tirade on his social media platform. The insults continued through the week, reaching a climax on June 5 with Mr. Trump threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him.",
      "Musk said he would shut down a SpaceX program that NASA relies on to transport astronauts \u2014 before later backtracking \u2014 and seemed to endorse an X post calling for Mr. Trump to be impeached. Musk also warned Republican lawmakers: \"Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years.\"",
      "During the back-and-forth, Mr. Trump claimed that he asked Musk to leave his administration and upset him with a provision in the budget bill that would end tax credits for electric vehicles.",

      "Washington \u2014 The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk broke down in dramatic and public fashion on Thursday, with the president threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him, fueling a feud that erupted over Musk's opposition to Republicans' tax and budget bill.",
      "In the afternoon, Musk dropped what he called \"the really big bomb,\" alleging that Mr. Trump's name appeared in the files related to the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking. \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Have a nice day, DJT!\"",

      "Musk also expressed support for a post that said Mr. Trump should be impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance.",
      "The break between the president and the world's richest man originated over Musk's ongoing criticism of Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" on Capitol Hill, which cuts taxes by trillions of dollars and implements Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in spending. Musk has railed against the legislation as \"outrageous\" and \"a disgusting abomination.\" The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated\u00a0on Wednesday that the bill would lead to an increase of $2.4 trillion in total deficits over the next 10 years, a conclusion that Republicans and Mr. Trump dispute.",
      "\"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday evening. \"The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.\"",

      "\"Elon and I had a great relationship,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"I don't know if we will anymore.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Musk, the CEO of Tesla, was around for the whole process of crafting the bill. The president claimed he \"never had a problem\" with the legislation until provisions dealing with electric vehicle subsidies were eliminated, threatening Tesla's business. The bill would roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, phasing out a tax break for clean energy vehicles.",
      "\"I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, adding that Musk \"worked hard\" and did a \"good job.\"",
      "\"And I'll be honest, I think he misses the place,\" the president continued. \"He's not the first. People leave my administration and they love us. And then, at some point, they miss it so badly. And some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it.\"",
      "\"Without me, Trump would have lost the election\"...\"Such ingratitude\"",

Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.\" In another post, he denied that he was aware of the details in the bill when it was crafted, writing that \"this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!\"",
      "\"Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\" Musk\u00a0went on. \"Such ingratitude,\" he added.",

      "The president's comments expressing disappointment with Musk were a swift about-face. Less than a week ago, Mr. Trump\u00a0gifted Musk a key to the White House as an expression of gratitude for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk wrapped up his time in the federal government Friday, as he reached the maximum amount of days he could serve as a special government employee.",

      "Arrests by Immigration and Customs Enforcement during President Trump's second term topped 100,000 this week, as federal agents intensified efforts to detain unauthorized immigrants in courthouses, worksites and communities across the U.S., internal government data obtained by CBS News shows.",
      "On Tuesday and Wednesday, ICE recorded more than 2,000 arrests each day, a dramatic increase from the daily average of 660 arrests reported by the agency during Mr. Trump's first 100 days back at the White House, the federal statistics show. During President Biden's last year in office, ICE averaged roughly 300 daily arrests, according to agency data.",
      "The latest numbers show ICE is getting closer to meeting the far-reaching demands of top administration officials like White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, an immigration hardliner who has forcefully pushed the agency to conduct \"a minimum\" of 3,000 arrests each day.",
      "On Thursday morning, ICE was holding around 54,000 immigrant detainees in detention facilities across the country, according to the data. The Trump administration is asking Congress to give ICE billions of dollars in extra funds to hire thousands of additional deportation officers and expand detention capacity to hold 100,000 individuals at any given point. Officials are also looking at converting facilities inside military bases into immigration detention centers.",
      "The marked increase in ICE arrests across the country \u2014 especially in major Democratic-led cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration officials \u2014 comes after the Trump administration replaced two of the agency's top leaders amid internal frustrations that arrest numbers were not high enough.",
      "CBS News reached out to the representatives for ICE and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "Trump administration officials have framed the aggressive expansion of immigration operations as necessary to fulfill the president's signature campaign promises of cracking down on illegal immigration, expelling immigrants with criminal histories and overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history.",
      "But to boost arrest numbers, ICE has resorted to more aggressive \u2014 and controversial \u2014 tactics that have triggered outrage and even confrontations in some communities.",
      "Those efforts include arrests of migrants and asylum-seekers showing up to court hearings or check-in appointments that the government instructed them to attend. Immigration lawyers have strongly denounced those arrests, saying they deter migrants from complying with the legal process. Immigration roundups at some worksites have also been reported recently.",
      "Videos of some ICE arrests have depicted sobbing women and children being escorted into vehicles outside of immigration courts. Footage has also captured community members confronting federal agents \u2014 some of them masked \u2014 as they take migrants into custody. One video showed construction workers suspected of being in the U.S. illegally lined up after an ICE-led operation on their worksite in Florida.",
      "And while ICE has been arresting many immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally and also have criminal records, the agency is simultaneously detaining non-criminal migrants living in the U.S. without proper documents \u2014 including longstanding residents \u2014 amid the Trump administration's pressure to increase arrest levels.",
      "Among them is Marcelo Gomes, an 18-year-old Brazilian-born high school student in Milford, Massachusetts, who was arrested by ICE last week on his way to volleyball practice. While ICE has acknowledged that agents were looking for his father when they arrested Gomes, it nevertheless transferred the teenager to a detention center, saying he's in the U.S. illegally. Gomes' lawyer said her client initially lived in the U.S. on a temporary visa that had since lapsed. On Thursday, Gomes was released from ICE custody after an immigration judge granted him bond.",
      "Before Mr. Trump took office, someone like Gomes would likely not have been arrested by ICE, given his age, his lack of any criminal record and the fact that he came to the U.S. as a child over a decade ago.",
      "But the Trump administration has reversed Biden-era restrictions on ICE operations that directed the agency to largely focus on detaining serious criminals, recent arrivals and national security threats, like suspected terrorists. Trump administration officials have said the Biden-era directives forced ICE agents to ignore federal immigration law.",
      "While ICE employees have spearheaded Mr. Trump's immigration crackdown, the agency is receiving support from other federal agencies as part of an unprecedented effort by the administration to muster manpower and resources from across the government for immigration enforcement.",
      "The federal agencies now helping ICE arrest unauthorized immigrants include Customs and Border Protection; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and the Internal Revenue Service. The Trump administration has also enlisted local and state law enforcement officials in friendly jurisdictions like Florida to support ICE operations.",

    "summary": "Once the deal is finalized, the seafood chain will operate under a new CEO \u2014 Damola Adamolekun, former chief executive of P.F. Chang's.",
    "story": [
      "After months of dozens of restaurant closings and headlines about \"endless shrimp\" woes, the seafood chain says it will soon exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.",
      "A U.S. bankruptcy judge on Thursday approved the casual seafood chain's reorganization plan, which includes a lender group led by asset manager Fortress acquiring the business. The green light arrives under just four months after Red Lobster filed for bankruptcy protection as it pursued a sale, following years of mounting losses and dwindling customers while it struggled to keep up with competitors.",
      "At the time of filing in May, Red Lobster's leadership shared plans to \"simplify the business\" through a reduction of locations. The chain, which lost $76 million in 2023, shuttered dozens of its North American restaurants over recent months \u2014 both leading up to and during the bankruptcy process. That includes more than 50 locations whose equipment was put up for auction just days before the Chapter 11 petition, followed by additional closures throughout the bankruptcy process.",
      "Red Lobster said Thursday that it expects to operate about 544 locations across the U.S. and Canada upon emerging from bankruptcy. That's down from 578 disclosed as of May's bankruptcy filing.",
      "Under terms of the acquisition, which is expected to close by the end of September, the chain will continue to operate as an independent company.",
      "Once the deal is finalized, Red Lobster will also get a new CEO \u2014 Damola Adamolekun, former chief executive of P.F. Chang's.",
      "Adamolekun was appointed to head RL Investor Holdings, the newly formed entity acquiring Red Lobster, by Fortress last week. In a statement Thursday, Adamolekun said that Red Lobster \"has a tremendous future\" and thanked Jonathan Tibus, who will leave the company and step down as CEO, for his leadership during the bankruptcy process.",
      "Red Lobster's purchaser is also providing additional funding to help the Orlando, Florida-based chain get back on its feet post-emergence. Adamolekun said the company's long-term investment plan includes a commitment of more than $60 million in new funding.",
      "Multiple ownership changes",
      "Known for its affordable seafood and cheddar biscuits, Red Lobster has seen multiple ownership changes over the course of its 56-year history. The brand was founded back in 1968 by Bill Darden, who sold Red Lobster to General Mills in 1970. General Mills later went on to form Darden Restaurants, which owns Olive Garden and other chains. Darden Restaurants was spun off from General Mills in 1995.",
      "Darden Restaurants later sold Red Lobster to a private equity firm in 2014. Thai Union Group, one of the world's largest seafood suppliers, first invested in Red Lobster in 2016 and upped its stake in 2020 \u2014 but announced its intention to exit its minority investment earlier this year.",
      "When announcing plans to divest in January, CEO Thiraphong Chansiri said the COVID-19 pandemic, industry headwinds and rising operating costs from Red Lobster had resulted in \"prolonged negative financial contributions to Thai Union and its shareholders.\" It reported a $19 million loss from Red Lobster for the first nine months of 2023.",
      "While not the sole reason, among sources of loss were \u2014 yes \u2014 those endless shrimp. Last year, Red Lobster significantly expanded the iconic all-you-can-eat special. But customer demand overwhelmed what the chain could afford. Thai Union leadership later noted that the deal's $20 price tag wasn't making enough money.",
      "Last year's shrimp debacle\u00a0wasn't the first time Red Lobster saw consequences of \"endless\" promises. In 2003, the company reportedly lost millions of dollars on an all-you-can-eat \"Endless Crab\" promotion when crab prices rose.",

Harvard\u00a0challenged the move in court, and on Thursday a federal judge\u00a0temporarily blocked the policy from going into effect.",
      "In a proclamation, Mr. Trump suspended the entry of foreign students or exchange visitors planning to go to Harvard, unless his administration determines somebody's entry \"would be in the national interest.\" The order also directs Secretary of State Marco Rubio to consider whether student visa holders who are already in the U.S. \"should have their visas revoked.\" The order will expire in six months, though an extension is possible.",
      "The order claimed Harvard \"is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs,\" accusing the school of failing to report students' disciplinary records to the federal government and criticizing it for ties to researchers based in China.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson called the order \"yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights.\"",
      "\"Harvard will continue to protect its international students,\" the spokesperson told CBS News.",

      "In the afternoon, Musk dropped what he called \"the really big bomb,\" alleging that Mr. Trump's name appeared in the files related to the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking. \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Have a nice day, DJT!\"",
      "Trump officials vowed to unveil more files related to the Epstein case when the administration took power. In February, the Justice Department issued a limited release of unredacted versions of files that had been public for years, a move that was met with criticism by conservatives who have demanded more transparency.",

Musk has railed against the legislation as \"outrageous\" and \"a disgusting abomination.\" The Congressional Budget Office\u00a0estimated\u00a0on Wednesday that the bill would lead to an increase of $2.4 trillion in total deficits over the next 10 years, a conclusion that Republicans and Mr. Trump dispute.",

Less than a week ago, Mr. Trump\u00a0gifted Musk a key to the White House as an expression of gratitude for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk wrapped up his time in the federal government Friday, as he reached the maximum amount of days he could serve as a special government employee.",

It allows players to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game,\" and lets them share their game screen with others. A built-in microphone will also allow chatting with other gamers.",

      "\"In addition, it\u2019s viewed as a direct insult to his father, King Charles III, as well as his extended royal family,\" Fordwich claimed. \"Ironically, Harry was close to Prince Philip, who fought for the historical significance of the Mountbatten-Windsor name for his descendants. So it is a direct insult to him.\"",
      "People magazine reported that Harry\u2019s two children, Prince Archie, 6, and Princess Lilibet, who turns 4 on June 4, have Mountbatten-Windsor as their last names on their birth certificates. However, the family now uses Sussex as their last name, just like how Harry was known as \"Harry Wales\" during his childhood when his parents held the titles of Prince and Princess of Wales. It\u2019s a tradition within the royal family for children to take their parents\u2019 titles as a surname.",

      "The elder Fan also served as the \"director of the Special Editorial Department of the Chinese News Agency,\" which now refers to the Xinhua News Agency, a top state-run propaganda outlet, according to the Hoover Institution. Multiple bios said he was also the deputy director of the \"Education Department of the News Bureau of the Central Propaganda Department.\"",
      "According to a Chinese government website reviewed by Fox News Digital, the CPD is the \"organization primarily responsible for monitoring content to ensure that China's publishers, in particular its news publishers, do not print anything that is inconsistent with the Communist Party's political dogma.\"",
      "After leaving state-owned media, Dongsheng held multiple leadership roles at the Cheung Kong School of Journalism and Communication at Shantou University, a Chinese university that has sections on their website that promote the CCP \"Party Building Work\" and hosted a themed life meeting a few years ago on \"Strive like an outstanding Communist Party member\"",
      "The editor of China Brief at the Jamestown Foundation expressed deep concerns when Fox News Digital reached out about Fan\u2019s familial ties to the CCP, saying she \"comes from an illustrious family of CCP journalists.\"",
      "\"Her grandfather was one of the more prominent propagandists of the CCP's struggles from the 1930s onwards, while her father worked for a range of party publications managed under the central propaganda department in Beijing,\" Arran Hope told Fox News Digital. \"This included a stint in the United States, where her daughter now works as chief of staff to mayoral candidate Scott Stringer, following a stint as a reporter for another party outlet here. Fan has not distanced herself from her family legacy, quite the opposite. In 2017, for example, she delivered a speech at a journalism school in the PRC (People's Republic of China) named in her grandfather's honor.\"",

      "\"More concerning for New York City's voters, she appears to be actively involved in the party's United Front system, which seeks to promote the party's preferences and control both within and without the PRC. She has given speeches at events organized by the PRC Consulate in New York that celebrate United Front organizations in the city,\" he continued. \"These events call for promoting reunification with Taiwan as well as advocating for the \u2018motherland\u2019 and its interests. To have somebody whom PRC diplomats clearly view favorably in such a senior role in New York politics should be cause for concern.\"",
      "Elaine Fan's late grandfather joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1939 and had leadership roles at multiple state-owned media outlets, including as the editor-in-chief of the Xinhua News Agency, deputy director of the General Administration of Information and president of the People's Daily News Agency, according to multiple bios on Baidu. In addition to her father and grandfather, Fan's uncle, Fan Xiaojian, joined the CCP in 1976 and has held multiple roles in the CCP, including as the chief economist and director of the finance department of the ministry of agriculture between 1998 and 2000.",
      "He was also a delegate to the 17th National Congress of the Communist Party of China and was a member of the 11th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, which Fox News Digital previously reported was \"designed to liaise with non-Communist Party members \u2013 and ultimately see them work with the CCP to advance its interests,\" according to a 2021 report from The Diplomat.",
      "During her tenure in the Hochul administration, Elaine attended several events hosted by the Chinese Consulate in New York City and multiple groups that make up China's United Front, which works to \"co-opt and neutralize sources of potential opposition to the policies and authority of its ruling,\" according to a U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission report.",

      "Elaine was a guest of honor at an event last September at the consulate in New York City to celebrate the 27th anniversary of the U.S.-Fujian Western Overseas Chinese Association, which is a United Front group, according to the Chinese government.",
      "She also attended an event called \"An Evening of Chinese Culture\" hosted by the New York Mets and Sino-American Friendship Association in 2023, which received backlash. According to an August 2022 op-ed from the Washington Post\u2019s deputy opinion editor, \"China experts have identified\" SAFA as \"being involved in United Front work \u2013 a global effort to propagandize on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.\"",
      "In 2021, Hochul gave a shout-out to Fan while announcing that Chinatown was a $20 Million New York City region winner for revitalization, saying she \"forgot to mention Elaine Fan is now my Director of Asian Affairs.\" She then told the crowd to \"Make sure you get to know Elaine Fan as well.\"",
      "Hudson Institute Fellow Michael Sobolik spoke to Fox News Digital about the totality of Fan's links to the CCP, saying, \"This isn't complicated.\"",
      "\"If Elaine Fan ever worked for CCP-controlled state media, she shouldn\u2019t be welcome in U.S. electoral politics. If Scott Stringer lacks discernment to insulate a campaign from potential vectors of CCP influence, how can he protect New York City from that malign influence in public office?\"",
      "In September 2023, Chinese Consul General Huang Ping in New York hosted a reception at the consulate to celebrate the 74th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, which included several officials, including Fan, who delivered remarks at the reception.",
      "Hochul\u2019s ties to Elaine Fan aren\u2019t the first time that her office has faced scrutiny over concerns about CCP influence. Hochul faced backlash last year after it was revealed that her former deputy chief of staff, Linda Sun, was indicted on charges of \"violating and conspiring to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act, visa fraud, alien smuggling, and money laundering conspiracy,\" according to a Department of Justice press release in September.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping (Ju Peng/Xinhua via Getty Images/File)",
      "Sun\u2019s lawyers have repeatedly denied the charges, but the indictment revealed some damning communications between Sun and Huang Ping, who left his role as the consul general of the New York City Chinese consulate weeks after the indictment against Sun was announced.",

      "Fox News Digital has extensively reported on Ping, who was spotted making visits to top universities, speaking with elected officials and carousing with top media outlets despite his long history of pushing CCP narratives and publicly denying human rights violations against China's Uyghur population. The unsealed indictment revealed that a speechwriter for then-Lt. Gov. Hochul wanted to mention the \"Uyghur situation\" in China for her 2021 Lunar New Year message, but the plight of the minority group being persecuted by the Chinese government was ultimately omitted after Sun overruled the speechwriter.",
      "The indictment says Sun revealed to Ping what the speechwriter wanted to include but insisted that she would not let her boss mention Uyghurs after admitting that she was \"starting to lose her temper\" with the speechwriter. Ping appeared to chalk up the speechwriter\u2019s suggestion as a clueless American who had never visited China and that U.S.-China relations could \"sour\" because of \"people like the speechwriter,\" the indictment said, prompting Sun to concur that the speechwriter had never visited China. Ping would go on to post Hochul\u2019s Lunar New Year message days later on his Facebook page, which did not mention Uyghurs.",

The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files.

The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.",
      "In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.",

While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure.

      "Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:",
      "1. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "3. Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",

      "4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions.",
      "6. Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide,\u00a0\"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.",

      "For many, the LexisNexis breach may be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.",

      "With the unveiling of Otto Aviation\u2019s Phantom 3500, humans are heading toward a future of windowless jets.",
      "The aircraft is redefining air travel by eliminating traditional windows in favor of a sleek, aerodynamic design, something many engineers are surely happy about.",
      "It\u2019s a radical approach, but it\u2019s one that, on top of improving fuel efficiency and reducing drag, will still offer some of the best views using digital technology.",

      "Phantom 3500 (Otto Aviation)",
      "Why is windowless design such a big deal for aircraft?",
      "Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, the Phantom 3500's surface allows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\"",
      "HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR",
      "This is a major contributor to its impressive aerodynamic performance. The windowless design is not just for aesthetics. Otto Aviation specifically engineered the fuselage to optimize laminar flow, using lightweight materials and smooth surfaces to further reduce drag and fuel consumption.",

      "A common concern with windowless aircraft is claustrophobia. To address this, the Phantom 3500 features high-definition digital screens along the cabin walls and ceiling. These displays stream real-time video from cameras mounted on the aircraft's exterior, offering passengers a panoramic, immersive view of the skies. Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience.",
      "The spacious, luminous cabin measures 800 cubic feet with a 6-foot-5-inch ceiling, comfortably accommodating four or more passengers in a luxurious, flexible layout. The cabin can seat up to nine passengers, depending on configuration, and is designed to maximize comfort and functionality. Freed from the constraints of window placement, the interior can be customized for relaxation, productivity or entertainment, ensuring passengers enjoy the journey as much as the destination.",

      "The Phantom 3500 builds on flight tests from Otto\u2019s Celera 500L prototype and Dassault Syst\u00e8mes\u2019 3DEXPERIENCE platform. By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8\u20131.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.",
      "Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500\u2019s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.",

      "5. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data.

Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Adidas breach shows that even companies with decades of brand equity and a massive global footprint are not immune to lapses in data security. It underscores the need for companies to go beyond basic compliance and actively evaluate the cybersecurity standards of every partner in their ecosystem. Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the trade-offs they make when sharing their personal information, and brands that fail to meet this moment may find their reputations eroding faster than they expect.",

      "The story of\u00a0AirCar begins in Slovakia, where designer \u0160tefan Klein and his team have been working on flying cars since the late 1980s. After years of prototypes and over 500 test flights, the AirCar is finally set for certification later this year. Customer deliveries are planned for early 2026, and the company even has plans for an amphibious version that could land on water.",

      "RADICAL NEW TECH BRINGS FLYING CARS CLOSER TO REALITY",
      "From the road to the sky in minutes",
      "So, how does it work? The AirCar looks like a sleek sports coupe on the road, with four wheels and a design that would fit right in next to a luxury sedan. When you need to fly, you simply drive to a runway, press a button and watch as the wings unfold and the tail extends. The transformation takes about 80 seconds, and there's no manual tinkering required. Once the wings are locked and the tail is in place, you're ready for takeoff. The steering wheel transforms into a flight yoke, and extra pedals appear for rudder control. The controls are designed to be intuitive for pilots, so if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't need to learn anything new.",

The base model puts out 280 horsepower, while the top version offers 340 horsepower with twin turbos. On the road, the AirCar can reach a top speed of about 124 mph, and it handles and feels much like a sports car. In the air, it cruises at 155 mph and can travel up to 620 miles on a single tank of fuel.",
      "The cabin is not pressurized, so the recommended ceiling is 10,000 feet, but it could go higher with oxygen tanks. The AirCar runs on regular high-octane gasoline, and you can fill up at most gas stations. In terms of size, it is about as long as a Mercedes S-Class and narrow enough to fit in a standard parking spot.",

      "THIS FLYING MOTORCYCLE CAN TAKE YOU FROM TRAFFIC TO SKY IN MINUTES",
      "What licenses do you need to drive and fly the AirCar?",
      "To operate the AirCar on the road, you will need a standard driver's license, just like any other car. If you want to take to the skies, you'll also need a private pilot's license. According to Klein Vision, the AirCar is designed so that if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't have to learn anything new to fly it. This means owners will need both driving and flying licenses, along with access to a runway, to fully experience everything the AirCar can do.",

      "AirCar (Klein Vision) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How does it compare to other flying cars?",
      "Unlike many flying car projects that never make it past the prototype stage, the AirCar is close to full certification and production.

This is a vehicle you could actually see on the road and in the air pretty soon. Sure, you'll need a pilot's license and a pretty big budget, but the fact that something like this is even possible is pretty amazing.

      "Given the number of phishing scams we have all faced over the past decade, most of us have developed a basic skill to spot and avoid obvious phishing emails or SMS messages. Cybercriminals are aware of this, and they have evolved their tactics by shifting to more complex and convincing schemes designed to bypass skepticism and lure victims.",
      "Their goal remains the same: to trick you into handing over sensitive information, especially credit card data. One of the latest examples is the rise in subscription scam campaigns. Scammers are creating incredibly convincing websites selling everything from shoes and clothes to electronics, tricking people into signing up for monthly subscriptions and willingly providing their credit card information. Facebook is being used as the primary platform to promote these new and sophisticated scams.",

      "What you need to know",
      "Bitdefender researchers have uncovered a massive and highly coordinated subscription scam campaign involving more than 200 active websites designed to look like real online stores. These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it.",
      "One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print.",
      "The scam doesn\u2019t stop there. Once you\u2019re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments. It\u2019s all designed to confuse you, overwhelm you with supposed perks and make the scam feel like a good deal.",
      "Researchers found that many of these websites share a single Cyprus address, possibly tied to offshore entities linked to the Paradise Papers. Despite being spread across different categories and brand names, the sites often use the same layouts, AI agents and payment structures, all pointing to a centralized fraud network.",
      "Scammers frequently rotate the brands they impersonate and have started moving beyond mystery boxes, now peddling low-quality products, counterfeit goods, fake investment schemes, dubious supplements and more. To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns.",

      "10 proactive measures to take to protect your data",
      "Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe:",
      "1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that\u2019s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing.",
      "2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:\u00a0These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions.",
      "3) Don\u2019t trust ads blindly on social media:\u00a0Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you\u2019re interested in a deal you see online, don\u2019t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media.",
      "4) Investigate before you buy:\u00a0Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports.",
      "5) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "7) Be cautious with payment methods: Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency.",
      "8) Limit personal information shared on social media: Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information.",
      "9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:\u00a0Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10) Keep your devices and software updated:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it\u2019s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked. Facebook has repeatedly failed to adequately vet or prevent these malicious campaigns from reaching vulnerable individuals. The platform\u2019s ad approval system should be more proactive in spotting and blocking ads promoting scams, particularly those that impersonate well-known brands or content creators.",

      "Kurt Knutsson talks about a viral video that shows a humanoid robot going wild. A tech nightmare or just a glitch?",
      "A chilling video circulating on social media has reignited old anxieties about robots turning against their creators. The footage shows a Unitree H1 humanoid robot, a machine about the size of an adult human, suddenly flailing its arms and legs with alarming force during a test, coming dangerously close to two technicians.",
      "The scene has sparked heated debate about the safety of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence. But is this truly the beginning of something out of our worst fears, or is there just a straightforward technical explanation for what happened?",

      "What the video shows",
      "In the viral clip first posted on\u00a0Reddit, the\u00a0Unitree H1 is seen suspended from a crane at a Chinese factory, surrounded by two handlers. Without warning, the robot loses control, thrashing its limbs, knocking over equipment and forcing the technicians to scramble out of harm's way. The chaos is palpable, and the images quickly drew comparisons to movies like \"The Terminator\" and \"I, Robot,\" with many viewers wondering if the age of rogue machines had finally arrived.",

      "The robot behind the incident",
      "The Unitree H1 is not a prototype but a commercially available, general-purpose humanoid robot. Standing 5.9 feet tall and weighing 104 pounds, it's designed to walk, run and even perform dynamic movements like backflips and dancing. Its joints are powerful and capable of generating 365 pound-feet of torque, enough to lift heavy objects or, in the wrong circumstances, cause serious harm.",

      "What went wrong?",
      "Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.",
      "The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.",

      "Experts, however, were quick to clarify that the malfunction was not evidence of a conscious or rebellious machine. Instead, it highlighted the importance of thorough safety protocols and testing, especially when deploying powerful machines in environments shared with people.",

      "The viral Unitree H1 video is a reminder that technology, especially when it's powerful and autonomous, demands respect and caution. While the footage is unsettling, the true story is one of technical error, not a robot rebellion. As robots become more common in our workplaces and public spaces, incidents like this will serve as important lessons for engineers, regulators and the public alike. For now, the machines are not plotting against us, but they do need careful supervision and thoughtful design to keep everyone safe.",

      "6 ways you can protect yourself from infostealer malware",
      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of infostealer malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider taking these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0\u200bCheck out my top picks for data removal services here.",

The provider did not disclose who uploaded it or whether the database was part of a legitimate archive that was accidentally published. Fowler could not determine whether this was the result of negligence or an operation with malicious intent.",
      "To verify the data, Fowler contacted some individuals listed in the records. Several confirmed that the information was accurate.

      "6 ways to protect yourself after a data breach",
      "1. Change your password on every platform: If your login credentials have been exposed, it\u2019s not enough to change the password on just one account. Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Our\u00a0top-rated password manager delivers powerful protection to help keep your accounts secure. It features\u00a0real-time data breach monitoring to alert you if your login details have been exposed, plus a built-in\u00a0data breach scanner\u00a0that checks your saved emails, passwords and credit card information against known leak databases. A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.",
      "3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.",
      "4. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps\u00a0need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Security is not only the responsibility of companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent. In an era where artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and global connectivity are reshaping technology, it is unacceptable that plain text files containing financial and governmental credentials are still left sitting online.",

      "Before receiving the\u00a0Neuralink implant, Smith relied on eye-tracking technology to communicate. While impressive, it came with major limitations.\u00a0\"It is a miracle of technology, but it is frustrating. It works best in dark rooms, so I was basically Batman. I was stuck in a dark room,\"\u00a0Smith shared in a\u00a0recent post on X. Bright environments would disrupt the system, making communication slow and sometimes impossible.

      "How the Neuralink brain implant works",
      "Smith is the first non-verbal person and only the third individual worldwide to receive the Neuralink Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The device, about as thick as five stacked coins, sits in his skull and connects to the motor cortex-the part of the brain that controls movement.",
      "Tiny wires, thinner than human hair, extend into Smith's brain. These pick up signals from his neurons and transmit them wirelessly to his MacBook Pro. The computer then decodes these signals, allowing Smith to move a cursor on the screen with his thoughts alone.",
      "As Smith explains, \"The Neuralink implant embedded in my brain contains 1024 electrodes that capture neuron firings every 15 milliseconds generating a vast amount of data. Artificial intelligence processes this data on a connected MacBook Pro to decode my intended movements in real time to move the cursor on my screen. Neuralink does not read my deepest thoughts or words I think about. It just reads how I wanna move and moves the cursor where I want.\"",

After more research, they discovered that signals related to his tongue were the most effective for cursor movement, and clenching his jaw worked best for clicking.\u00a0\"I am not actively thinking about my tongue, just like you don't think about your wrist when you move a mouse. I have done a lot of cursor movements in my life. I think my brain has switched over to subconscious control quickly so I just think about moving the cursor,\"\u00a0Smith said.",

The system includes a virtual keyboard and shortcuts for common actions, making tasks like copying, pasting and navigating web pages much easier.",
      "Smith also worked with Neuralink engineers to develop a \"parking spot\" feature for the cursor.\u00a0\"Sometimes you just wanna park the cursor and watch a video. When it is in the parking spot, I can watch a show or take a nap without worrying about the cursor,\" he explained.",

It uses Grok 3 and an AI clone of my old voice to generate options for me to say. It is not perfect, but it keeps me in the conversation and it comes up with some great ideas,\" Smith shared.

Despite the challenges of ALS, Smith finds meaning and hope in his faith.\u00a0\"I have not always understood why God afflicted me with ALS but with time I am learning to trust his plan for me. I'm a better man because of ALS. I'm a better disciple of Jesus Christ because of ALS. I'm closer to my amazing wife, literally and figuratively, because of ALS,\" he said.",

      "The two Chinese nationals were charged Tuesday with smuggling Fusarium graminearum fungus, a dangerous biological pathogen and \"known agroterrorism agent\" responsible for billions of dollars in economic losses worldwide each year, through Detroit's airport. The noxious substance causes \"head blight,\" a disease of wheat, barley, maize, and rice, according to federal prosecutors. In humans and livestock, exposure to its toxins causes vomiting, liver damage, and reproductive defects.",
      "\"It's a new take on Chinese espionage and sabotage of the US economy. But it's not a surprise. I think that China has failed to pull back on any of its aggressive activity. And this is something that the Trump administration probably wants to take into consideration,\" Whiton said of the case. \"I think it's both the government and our universities have let down the American people.\"",

      "Chinese Nationals Charged with Conspiracy and Smuggling a Dangerous Biological Pathogen into the U.S. for their Work at a University of Michigan Laboratory (Detroit Free Press/IMAGN)",
      "Whiton told Fox News Digital that Chinese infiltration of U.S. institutions has been happening since at least the 1990s \u2013 when Chinese spies stole American nuclear secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico \u2013 and since then, \"there\u2019s been this systemic desire to put Chinese nationals into especially these technical areas, technical universities.\"\u00a0Whiton said Beijing does not consider only Chinese citizens as its agents, as \"anyone of Chinese ethnicity\" have been viewed as \"fair game\" to be recruited. He categorized the H1-B visa program as essentially a \"scam,\" asserting that about a quarter are awarded to Chinese nationals who \"end up at some of our high-tech companies.\"",
      "Traditionally, Whiton explained, Republicans have believed universities should run themselves without political interference, but doing so has allowed such institutions to be taken over by left-wingers.",
      "\"Taxpayers are funding these things and shouldn't be forced to fund things that are anathema to their beliefs and what they know to be true. Things like we shouldn't train our enemies at taxpayer expense,\" Whiton said. \"So, I think it goes along with Republicans being pretty wimpy in the past, but only more recently with the emergence of the new right and the MAGA movement finally taking a tougher stand on some of these left-wing universities.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has said the United States does not want to de-couple with China, though Beijing has a choice whether to be a reliable partner.",
      "\"The reality is China is kind of doing what it has always done,\" Whiton said. \"So if we're looking for a change of Chinese conduct because of President Trump being in office, it just hasn't happened yet. So I can't say that's a surprise.\"",
      "Last week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced that the Trump administration would \"aggressively\" revoke the student visas for Chinese nationals, \"including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.\"\u00a0After a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, which the White House said focused mostly on trade, President Donald Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Thursday that Chinese students were still coming and the U.S. would be \"honored\" to have them. Yet, the president said the students need to be properly \"checked\" and the administration wants lists of Chinese nationals admitted to schools, such as Harvard and Columbia, so that vetting can occur.",

      "TRUMP TOUTS 'VERY POSITIVE' BREAKTHROUGH WITH XI AFTER SLAMMING CHINA FOR TRADE VIOLATION",
      "\"That's a step in the right direction,\" Whiton said. \"But in reality, we probably need to recognize these are our chief economic and security adversary in the world and take those visa numbers down closer to zero and start sending these people home.\"",
      "Whiton said there is a \"faulty assumption\" that Chinese students would come to the United States, learn about American culture and bring an appreciation back home to China.",
      "\"In reality, they sort of come over here, they're in a bubble, they pick up technical skills, and then they go back to China and put them to use for either the military directly or for corporations that are either utilized by the Chinese military or that are trying to undermine U.S. technology companies,\" Whiton said. \"We really are essentially educating and arming our chief adversary in the world.\"",
      "Former Rep. Michelle Steel, a California Republican who served on the House foreign and intelligence committees, told Fox News Digital that Chinese students educated in the U.S. essentially return home without an appreciation for America.",
      "\"After they study here, they took all of our brains here, and they took everything back to their country, and they are using to attack United States. And they hate United States after that education. Guess what we are teaching in the universities? Not love United States!\" Steel, who was born in Korea and grew up in Japan, told Fox News Digital. \u00a0\"They are studying some very sensitive things in our universities. We really had to vet them well.\"",
      "In her eyes, U.S. universities have prioritized bringing in international students for economic gain.",
      "Rep. Michelle Steel, R-Calif., on Capitol Hill on May 23, 2024.\u00a0 (Michael A. McCoy/Getty Images)",
      "\"Because of all the money,\" she said. \"They try to build their endowments, and they want to just show how big their research center is.\"",
      "She cited the case against former Chair of Harvard University\u2019s Chemistry and Chemical Biology Department, Dr. Charles Lieber, who was convicted in 2023 of lying to federal authorities about his affiliation with the People's Republic of China\u2019s Thousand Talents Program and the Wuhan University of Technology (WUT) in Wuhan, China. Federal prosecutors said Lieber had been paid $1.5 million by the CCP and failed to report additional income of $50,000 payments per month from the WUT.",
      "\"It's not just at University of Michigan, but it's just everywhere,\" Steel said. \"We cannot bring everybody in to these universities and studying together and helping to build CCP's military. That's just totally no-no, because you know what they're doing in the Pacific areas and African countries and South American countries. And they're just expanding everywhere. And we are the only one [who] can stop [it]. And I think President Trump is doing great job.\"",

She has advocated for legislation that would decrease the reporting requirement from $250,000 to $50,000.",
      "Steel also noted that Stanford University \u2013 located in the heart of Silicon Valley in California \u2013 has a relationship with China\u2019s Peking University, which in turn has ties to the Chinese military and \"goes straight into the nuclear program.\" The current chair of the House Select Committee on the CCP, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., penned a letter to Stanford in March over concerns about U.S. universities \"admitting large numbers of Chinese nationals into advanced STEM programs, potentially at the expense of qualified Americans.\"",

      "A chaotic protest in Minneapolis during which federal agents were seen getting physical with demonstrators unfolded as elected officials posted \"highly irresponsible\" information online suggesting a criminal search warrant was an ICE operation, police say.",
      "Tense moments were captured on video Tuesday as federal agents and the public clashed in the streets of the major city, with Minnesota State Sen. Omar Fateh claiming on Facebook, \"On scene are DHS, ICE, FBI, Sheriffs, and MPD\" in what he described as \"blatant fascism on display.\"",
      "In a follow-up post, Fateh said, \"While the Mayor has told us ICE is not welcome in our city, what residents saw was their deployment assisted by his MPD.\"",
      "However, the federal operation focusing on a Mexican restaurant actually \"was related to a criminal search warrant for drugs and money laundering and was not related to immigration enforcement\" and \"No arrests were made,\" according to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.",
      "\"The information that came out on social media from elected officials was highly irresponsible,\" Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt said Wednesday. \"There were ways for them to have accurate information and instead of getting accurate information, being impulsive and putting out things that could potentially incite riots is senseless.\"",

Putting out the rhetoric that it was an immigration enforcement, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office does not participate in immigration enforcement. Elected officials have a responsibility to the constituents to put out accurate information. They don't have to agree with it, but do not mislead the public, causing more harm to our communities.\"",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara added, \"Ultimately, you can say what you want and point fingers and blame people for different things, how it happened, whether they should or shouldn\u2019t have or whatever, but the bottom line is if a tragedy happened at Lake and Bloom yesterday, it doesn\u2019t matter who is at fault. The community loses. The feds lose. We all lose, and we are left behind.",
      "\"The feds can leave, we are left behind to deal with the consequences,\" O'Hara continued. \"And what I saw yesterday as they were trying to leave, aside from just the verbal things that were being said, but with things being thrown at them \u2014 in some cases heavily-armed federal agents getting into hand-to-hand situations with people who are protesting \u2014 is not good.\"",

      "\"The amended complaint also includes sweeping allegations of ideological, philosophical, religious, and political concerns and grievances, that have\u00a0nothing to do with a federal lawsuit,\" he declared this week. \"After review of Plaintiffs\u2019 amended complaint, I find that it fails to sufficiently allege the facts necessary to plausibly state viable claims under Title VI, the Pennsylvania Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, and for breach of contract.\"",
      "\"While Plaintiffs spend an inordinate amount of space expounding on long-past injustices and incidents, some dating as far back as 1993, and complaining that Penn did not take the actions or respond to their reports, letters, or emails in the manner which Plaintiffs wanted, Plaintiffs have failed to plead any facts showing either intentional discrimination or deliberate indifference on the part of Penn,\"\u00a0Goldberg\u00a0continued.",

      "\"Because of these incidents, the numerous protests, and the Palestine Writes Festival, Plaintiffs assert they have been forced to miss classes and other campus activities and experiences, have felt threatened and/or unsafe in their residences, classrooms, and other places on campus, have felt as though they needed to refrain from wearing certain articles of clothing or jewelry or refrain from speaking out on matters of importance to them, and/or have otherwise felt as though they had to hide or obscure their Jewish identities,\" he added. \"As a result, Plaintiffs aver they have lost educational and extracurricular opportunities and lost the value of the tuition and fees paid to Penn.\"",

      "\"Deliberate indifference is a very high bar and Plaintiffs\u2019 dissatisfaction with Penn\u2019s responses is not enough to establish there was an official decision by Penn to not remedy a Title VI violation and that this deliberate indifference effectively caused racial discrimination,\"\u00a0Goldberg\u00a0ruled.",

    "summary": "From centrists worried about Medicaid cuts to conservative hard-liners demanding steeper spending reductions, Senate GOP leaders face a tricky balancing act.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As Senate Republican leaders push to a massive bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda by July 4, they are juggling a host of competing demands.",
      "Some senators are genuine threats to vote against the legislation, while others are expected to support it in the end after using their demands to shape it. Several of them have complicated political considerations. The Republicans who are speaking out most loudly point to a variety of ways the House-passed bill may change in the Senate, as party leaders seek to ease enough of their concerns.",
      "With all Democrats expected to vote against the package, Republicans will need at least 50 votes to pass it, as Vice President JD Vance could break a tie.",
      "Here are seven key senators to watch.",
      "Rand Paul",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is the only Republican senator who has voted against this legislation every step of the way. He has blasted the spike in military spending, the huge increase in deficits and, in particular, the $5 trillion debt limit hike. Paul does support a key part of the package \u2014 an extension of the Trump's 2017 tax cuts \u2014 but he wants to offset it with trillions of dollars in additional spending cuts, which the GOP has no hope of finding consensus on.",
      "Paul typically doesn\u2019t play games with his red lines. Barring an uncharacteristic about face, expect him to vote against the bill.",
      "Susan Collins",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is the sole surviving GOP senator to represent a state that Democrats consistently win at the presidential level. And she faces re-election this year. Her trajectory has been revealing, from supporting the initial budget resolution to voting against the revised version. A key reason for her opposition? Concerns that the Medicaid cuts would harm low-income and elderly constituents.",
      "She also expressed reservations about going after waste and fraud in Medicare, as GOP leaders have begun to consider. In addition, Collins and others like Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, would firmly oppose overruling the parliamentarian, the Senate\u2019s in-house referee who settles rule disputes, if she disqualifies some policies.",
      "Collins voted for the party's 2017 tax law, but she has been willing to vote against major GOP bills in the past. Party leaders will need to take her demands seriously in order to win her vote.",
      "Lisa Murkowski",
      "When Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted for the budget blueprint in April that kickstarted the process of writing the legislation, she quickly followed it up with a broad set of grievances that will need to be addressed, or she\u2019ll be \u201cunable to support\u201d the final product. Among other things, she took issue with Medicaid cuts and an accounting trick her party is using to obscure the cost of the tax cuts.",
      "Two months later, her concerns persist. Asked Thursday by NBC News what she wants to change in the emerging bill, Murkowski replied dryly, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll give you a list.\u201d",
      "Murkowski has criticized the phaseout and repeal of clean energy tax credits that benefit her state, writing a letter in April with three of her colleagues \u2014 Sens. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Curtis \u2014 highlighting the importance of America\u2019s energy independence, which they argued could be weakened as a result of this bill.",
      "Murkowski has shown an independent streak and a willingness to take political arrows when standing her ground.",
      "Mike Crapo",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and will help craft some of the biggest and most contentious pieces of the bill \u2014 including the tax cuts and Medicaid cuts. Despite his soft-spoken and non-confrontational style, Crapo won\u2019t be able to make everybody happy.",
      "And any changes he makes in the Senate would have to be palatable to the wafer-thin House Republican majority, which engaged in painstaking negotiations before passing its version of the bill by a one-vote margin.",
      "One example of the disconnect is the expanded $40,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, to placate a group of blue-state House Republicans. But there are no GOP senators representing blue states where that is a big issue. Crapo said \"there's not a strong mood in the Senate Republican caucus right now\" to expand SALT.",
      "The bill represents his biggest test since taking the powerful gavel.",
      "Thom Tillis",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he wants to adjust the phaseouts of the clean energy tax credits with a more \u201ctargeted\u201d approach to protect U.S. businesses that are already invested in existing projects. He said there\u2019s \u201cgeneral consensus that the House proposed language will be modified.\u201d Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., agreed, telling NBC News some phaseouts will likely be pushed back.",
      "A member of the Finance Committee, Tillis has sounded generally positive about the direction of the bill, making him a likely \u201cyes\u201d vote. But he\u2019s skeptical that the Senate will meet the Independence Day deadline: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that have to go perfectly right to get all that done and be out by July 4.\u201d",
      "Tillis faces a tough political balancing act: He\u2019s up for re-election next year in a state that Democrats will be targeting; but first he needs to get through a Republican primary, which means staying on Trump\u2019s good side.",
      "Ron Johnson",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., has railed against the bill and its estimated $2.4 trillion contribution to the deficit, insisting he can't vote for it as written. He has slammed the idea of a mega-bill, calling for breaking it up and limiting the debt ceiling hike.",
      "Trump asked him to be \u201cless negative\u201d during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, Johnson said.",
      "\u201cI think we had a good, lively discussion between the two of us,\u201d Johnson told NBC News. \u201cHe obviously would like me to be a little less negative, a little more positive, which I\u2019m happy to do.\u201d",
      "Johnson said he isn\u2019t trying to make Trump and GOP leaders' jobs harder. And the senator zig-zagged his way to \u201cyes\u201d on the 2017 tax law after initially coming out against it, so party leaders have reason to be optimistic that he won\u2019t sink this legislation.",
      "Josh Hawley",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has been the Senate GOP\u2019s most vocal opponent of cutting Medicaid \"benefits\u201d \u2014 and he's been specific about which parts of the House bill he\u2019s worried about, citing the Medicaid provider tax and cost-sharing provisions.",
      "Notably, Hawley said he's fine with coverage losses resulting from Medicaid work requirements and expanded proof-of-eligibility provisions. Those make up the bulk of the House bill's savings.",
      "Hawley has also expressed reservations about including any provisions in the bill related to Medicare, which Republicans recently said they would discuss related to savings connected to so-called \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d Hawley called that \u201ca terrible idea,\u201d telling reporters Thursday, \u201cIf you don\u2019t ever want to win an election again, just go fiddle around with people\u2019s Medicare that they\u2019ve worked hard for, paid into.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Looking at new ways to pay for their sprawling bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s domestic agenda, Republicans are exploring ideas to slash \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d in Medicare, several senators said Thursday.",
      "And President Donald Trump has blessed the pursuit, they said.",
      "\u201cI think anything that can be \u2014 that\u2019s waste, fraud and abuse are open to, obviously, discussions,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., told reporters.",
      "He said that Republicans have primarily looked at Medicaid to find savings but that they\u2019re open to looking at other programs, too.",
      "\u201cThe focus, as you know, has been on addressing waste, fraud, abuse within Medicaid and, but right now, we\u2019re open to suggestions that people have them about other areas where there is, you know, clearly, waste, fraud and abuse that can be rooted out in any government program,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Medicare has historically been seen as political third rail, a program members of both parties have been wary of touching in fear of backlash from older voters.",
      "But Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said they shouldn\u2019t be afraid of cutting waste in Medicare.",
      "\u201cWhy don\u2019t we go after that? I think we should,\u201d Cramer said.",
      "\u201cSome people are afraid of the topics; I\u2019m not,\u201d he added, noting that they would focus on waste, fraud and abuse. \u201cIn my view, this is our moment as Republicans in control of all three branches, and we ought to be going after more fiscal responsibility. And some people are making that case. Other people are wringing their hands.\u201d",
      "Senate Republicans said that they discussed the issue during a closed-door meeting and that it also came up with Trump when Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee met with him Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWhat the president made clear is [he] does not want to see any cuts to beneficiaries. But to go after, he repeated over again \u2014 the waste, fraud and abuse, the waste, fraud and abuse,\u201d Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., said.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai echoed that point.",
      "\u201cThe president has been clear \u2014 no cuts to Medicare, Social Security, or Medicaid.  This bill addresses waste, fraud, and abuse in government spending,\u201d Desai said in an email.",
      "The discussions open up a policy debate that could have explosive political ramifications. Medicare is a highly popular program that provides health insurance to people over 65 years old, and Democrats are already launching attacks on the new GOP discussions about making changes to the program.",
      "\u201cA program that 66 million Americans rely on is not waste, fraud, or abuse \u2014 it\u2019s lifesaving for the constituents of Republicans pushing to gut Medicare,\u201d Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said in a statement Thursday. \u201cLet\u2019s be crystal clear: Donald Trump gave Republicans the green light to gut access to lifesaving medication and rip away health insurance to fund tax handouts for billionaires. These dangerous attacks are as disgraceful as they are unpopular \u2014 and will cost Republicans their seats come the midterms.\u201d",
      "GOP leaders are searching for ways to lower the cost of the bill passed by the House, which the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects would add $2.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. It includes Medicaid and health spending cuts that Republicans describe as \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse,\u201d which the CBO estimates would result in 10.9 million fewer people having insurance.",
      "Still, some conservative senators insist on mitigating the red ink to vote for the bill. And it\u2019s unclear how narrowly or broadly Senate Republicans would define \u201cwaste, fraud and abuse\u201d when it comes to Medicare.",
      "There is skepticism in the GOP about pursuing that path.",
      "\u201cWhat a terrible idea. We should not be touching Medicare,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said, recalling that trying to cut retirement spending has burned the Republican Party in the past.",
      "\u201cIn 2004 President Bush got re-elected and promptly tried to privatize Social Security, and Republicans didn\u2019t win the popular vote for 20 years,\u201d Hawley said. \u201cSo if you don\u2019t ever want to win an election again, just go fiddle around with people\u2019s Medicare that they\u2019ve worked hard for, paid into.\u201d",
      "Hawley launched similar criticisms when Republicans began going after Medicaid for savings, but he said he supports most of the spending cuts in the House-passed bill, including the work requirements and eligibility rules.",
      "The talks about Medicare came as news to some Republicans.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t heard any discussion of cutting Medicare. That\u2019s a vital program that people have earned their benefits for, and I\u2019m not going to say never, because maybe there\u2019s some waste, fraud, abuse, kind of language, but I certainly would not support cutting Medicare benefits,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters.",
      "A potential option senators mentioned is a bipartisan bill that would \u201cimprove the way Medicare Advantage plans assess patients\u2019 health risks and reduce overpayments for care,\u201d according to a description of the legislation. The bill, called the \"No UPCODE Act,\" is co-sponsored by Sens. Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.",

      "Already, firms are showing signs of holding back on investment and bringing on new workers. Earlier in the week, the BLS reported that the hiring rate remains stuck at levels last seen in 2014, when the U.S. economy was still emerging from the Great Recession.",

In a post on Truth Social Wednesday, he pointed to the weak ADP payrolls numbers as evidence that the economy needs support.",
      "Analysts say that despite the gathering signs of economic deterioration, the bar remains high for the Federal Reserve to lower rates. Instead, the central bank will likely continue to err on the side of keeping interest rates elevated to ensure the pace of price growth remains under control, said Andrew Husby, senior U.S. economist at BNP Paribas financial group.",

      "A federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's efforts to block visas for foreign students planning to attend Harvard, after the Ivy League college filed a legal challenge.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge Allison D. Burroughs granted a temporary restraining order that enjoins anyone from \"implementing, instituting, maintaining, enforcing, or giving force or effect to the Presidential Proclamation\" that Trump issued Wednesday.",
      "Harvard had earlier Thursday amended its complaint against the Trump administration to challenge Trump's proclamation that the president issued the day before.",
      "It would have denied visas to foreign students who planned to enter the United States to study at Harvard, in his latest attack on the prominent university.",
      "Harvard President Alan M. Garber said Trump and his administration were retaliating against Harvard because it has refused the administration's demands, which included auditing viewpoints of the student body.",
      "\u201cSingling out our institution for its enrollment of international students and its collaboration with other educational institutions around the world is yet another illegal step taken by the Administration to retaliate against Harvard,\u201d Garber said in a letter to the campus community.",
      "Trump's Wednesday proclamation targeting Harvard followed an attempt by the Department of Homeland Security late last month to limit Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students by revoking its certification in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which was temporarily blocked by Burroughs.",
      "Burroughs on Thursday also extended the restraining order in that matter until June 20, or until a preliminary injunction order can be issued.",
      "In granting the restraining order blocking implementation of Trump's proclamation and the DHS effort, Burroughs wrote that she was acting \"to preserve the status quo pending a hearing.\"",
      "Trump's proclamation would not affect only incoming students. It says the State Department will review existing foreign students at Harvard under F, M or J visas to determine whether their visas should be revoked.",
      "Harvard said in its amended complaint that Wednesday's proclamation, as well as the previous attempt by the Department of Homeland Security to revoke its ability to enroll foreign students, violates its First Amendment rights.",
      "\"Each is part of a concerted and escalating campaign of retaliation by the government in clear retribution for Harvard\u2019s exercising its First Amendment rights to reject the government\u2019s demands to control Harvard\u2019s governance, curriculum, and the 'ideology' of its faculty and students,\" the amended complaint reads.",
      "\"The government\u2019s actions, moreover, have no basis in law,\" it reads.",
      "Harvard's amended complaint argues that the immigration law Trump's proclamation cites allows the president to prohibit \"a class of aliens whose entry would be 'detrimental to the interests of the United States'\" \u2014 and that Trump's proclamation does not suspend entry for a class, just people who want to attend Harvard.",
      "\"The President\u2019s actions thus are not undertaken to protect the 'interests of the United States,' but instead to pursue a government vendetta against Harvard,\" it argues.",

      "Garber wrote in Thursday's letter that Harvard will defend its international students.",
      "The university said in the amended complaint that the attempts to target international students harms all of its students, because Harvard \"prepares them to contribute to and lead in our global society.\"",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/planned-parenthood-provides-basic-health-care-clinics-close-will-many-rcna210757",
    "published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 09:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Citing deep funding cuts, at least 200 Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide are at risk.",
    "story": [
      "When the Trump administration suddenly froze federal funding to more than 100 Planned Parenthood clinics this spring, the organization\u2019s Michigan branch was already deep into hard discussions about its finances.",
      "\u201cThe leadership team and our board had been scenario planning for months to try to fill those gaps to see how we could continue providing care,\u201d said Ashlea Phenicie, chief external affairs officer of Planned Parenthood of Michigan.",
      "The only option was clear. Michigan\u2019s 14 Planned Parenthood clinics serve tens of thousands of women. In order to save clinics around the state that were either busier or in places where women had few other options, the team would have to close multiple clinics, including the only one in the state\u2019s Upper Peninsula, a large, isolated and mostly rural area surrounded by a stretch of Lake Michigan. In Ann Arbor, home of Michigan State University, the city\u2019s two clinics would be combined.",
      "It\u2019s a reality playing out across the country.",
      "At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed or will close within the year. For decades, the health care organization has been squeezed by the same pressures choking nearly all U.S. providers \u2013\u2013 low insurance reimbursement rates, blocked Medicaid expansion, understaffing and rising costs of providing medical care that have forced hospitals and health clinic closures throughout the country.",
      "Uniquely, Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that serves more than 2 million patients nationwide every year, many of them uninsured, underinsured or who qualify for Medicaid, has also become the target of pointed funding cuts that started under the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWhat is different this time around is that it\u2019s much more sweeping. It\u2019s a deeper and broader cut that will affect both more clinics and more people,\u201d said Farzana Kapadia, a professor of epidemiology and population health at the New York University School of Global Public Health.",
      "In March, the Trump administration withheld funding by excluding many Planned Parenthood clinics from the Title X family planning program, a federal grant program that funds family planning and reproductive health care. Then, in late May, House Republicans delivered another enormous blow, voting to end funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the reconciliation bill.",
      "Federal law already restricts federal funds from being used for abortion, except in cases of incest, rape or if a mother\u2019s life is in danger, through a law called the Hyde Amendment.",
      "But if passed, the reconciliation bill would cut off Medicaid reimbursement to any nonprofit that primarily offers family planning or reproductive health services, provides abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment exceptions and received more than $1 million in Medicaid reimbursements in 2024. As a nationwide organization, Planned Parenthood does all three.",
      "If the bill passes in the Senate, it would block Planned Parenthood clinics from billing Medicaid for any health services at all, including cancer screenings, wellness exams and birth control. It's unclear if the new legislation would apply to Planned Parenthood nationally or on a state-by-state basis.",
      "Over half of Planned Parenthood patients are covered by publicly funded health programs like Medicaid and in 2023, about 36% of all Title X services were provided by Planned Parenthood clinics. Eliminating these sources of funding would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from Planned Parenthood\u2019s care costs every year. Targeting federal funding for any type of care for Planned Parenthood clinics is a way opponents of abortion rights can attempt to shut down clinics that do provide abortion, even if they also offer other care.",
      "Phenicie said Republican lawmakers appear to understand that cutting off Planned Parenthood from Title X and Medicaid reimbursement will put the clinics that perform abortion in peril, even if these funds can\u2019t cover the procedures. The slashed funds could affect all Planned Parenthood clinics whether they offer abortion services or not.",
      "\u201cThey know so much of our patient base is on Medicaid or needs Title X to pay for their care, they know that cutting this off will allow them to cut off access to abortion and they are willing to make that trade,\u201d she said.",
      "Before the cuts, Planned Parenthood was already operating on thin margins. Now, clinics are struggling to operate at a loss.",
      "\u201cThe numbers are so devastating that there are really no options other than closing some centers and consolidating others, and then investing in our virtual health centers that can serve people across the state,\u201d Phenicie said.",
      "Clinics provide basic health care",
      "At least 1 in 3 women say they have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care, as well as 1 in 10 men, according to a recent KFF Health poll. Nearly half of Black women have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic, the poll found.",
      "Abortions, the main reason the Trump administration has ended support for the clinics, account for just 4% of the services Planned Parenthood provides, according to a 2024 annual report.",
      "The vast majority of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services involve basic health care for women, including diagnosing and treating urinary tract and yeast infections and screening for cervical cancer and breast cancer. Some locations offer vaccination against HPV, hepatitis B, Covid and influenza.",
      "More than half of care is related to testing for sexually transmitted infections and treatment. Another 25% is providing access to contraception, often at low or no cost. Cancer screenings and other non-abortion services make up 18%, the report showed.",
      "Those important medical services haven\u2019t swayed opponents of the clinics.",
      "In January, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., introduced a bill that sought to ban Planned Parenthood from federal funding in the same ways the federal reconciliation bill would. The bill is called the Defund Planned Parenthood Act.",
      "\u201cMy commitment to protecting life isn\u2019t just personal, it\u2019s rooted in both science and principle. Life begins at conception, and I\u2019ve spent my time in the Senate fighting to protect the right to life,\u201d Paul said in a press release.",
      "Closing in states that support abortion rights",
      "About 40% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding comes from government health care reimbursements and grants. Many locations offer a sliding scale payment option for people who can\u2019t afford health care. That money comes, in part, from government programs that are now being cut.",
      "\u201cCutting this funding is really about cutting access to care for people who are not insured or who are underinsured to allow for tax breaks for people who can afford their medical care,\u201d NYU\u2019s Kapadia said.",
      "Wendy Stark, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, said that even when a patient has private insurance, \u201cthe reimbursement rates are just not meeting the costs of primary care.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. health care system pays a tiny amount of health care dollars into primary and preventative care,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWe are sitting in a micro version of that.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Planned Parenthood announced it was selling the building that housed its only Manhattan location. Planned Parenthood locations are also shuttering throughout the Midwest and in other states that have historically voted in favor of abortion rights, including Vermont.",
      "In late May, Planned Parenthood announced it will close four clinics in Minnesota within a year. The state was the first to codify the right to abortion into law after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, but only one of the closing clinics performed abortions.",
      "Four of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa, including one in Ames, where Iowa State University is located, will also be shuttered. Four Illinois clinics, none which performed abortions, stopped operating in March. In April, three locations closed and two were consolidated in Michigan, where the right to abortion is enshrined into state law. Two Utah locations closed in May after losing a significant amount of funding as a result of the Title X freeze.",
      "\u201cWe are subsidizing almost every visit we do, even with insurance,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWe also have a great deal of our patients who come who do not have insurance.\u201d",
      "The decision to sell the Manhattan clinic was a strategic but difficult decision, she said. The revenue from the sale could help keep other clinics in the state operating. Both the patients and staff of the Manhattan clinic can be absorbed by Planned Parenthood\u2019s other New York City locations, which can minimize the impact the closure will have.",
      "\u201cWhen we consolidate in certain locations, we look at the whole area. Can we funnel patients to our next closest health center, are there other clinics that patients can be sent to?\u201d Stark said, adding that this is more difficult to do in rural areas that already have extremely minimal health care options.",
      "\u201cIf we face further erosion of our finances, we will have to make more hard decisions,\u201d she said.",
      "Straining a fragile health care system",
      "Several state-level laws banned Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds in the decade preceding the sweeping federal exclusions.",
      "Robin Marty, the executive director of WAWC Healthcare, formerly West Alabama Women\u2019s Center, in Tuscaloosa, said these states can provide a picture of what health care may look like in states that have more recently faced Planned Parenthood closures.",
      "\u201cWe exist as kind of a lesson to people of what resources are like if there is not a Planned Parenthood,\u201d she said.",
      "Planned Parenthood operates just one brick-and-mortar clinic in Alabama, in Birmingham, but offers telehealth throughout the state. There are just two in Louisiana and one in the Florida Panhandle.",
      "There are no physical clinics in Mississippi, which has the highest teen birth rate in the nation. Alabama and Louisiana rank in the top seven, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Mississippi also has the highest maternal mortality rate. Louisiana comes in second. Alabama is fourth.",
      "\u201cThere aren\u2019t places for people to go for free birth control or STI screenings or maternal care,\u201d she said, referring to sexually transmitted infections.",
      "WAWC Healthcare is one of the only providers in Alabama, outside of federally qualified health centers, which are run by states or counties, that does. Already, Marty said, the clinic relies heavily on nongovernmental grants in the absence of access to Title X, though the clinic does accept Medicaid.",
      "\u201cEvery time I apply for a grant, I know I have only about a 10% chance of getting it, but I do it anyway because that\u2019s the only way my patients can get care,\u201d she said. Other than grants, \u201cwe rely on donors who each donate about $50 each time we contact them.\u201d",
      "Marty said other clinics that provide some of the same services as Planned Parenthood, which are already operating on razor-thin margins, if not at a loss, will be further strained by closures. This strain will be passed onto patients.",
      "\u201cYou are talking about individuals who are living at or below the poverty level who already can\u2019t afford health care on their own and then you are eliminating a major source of their health care,\u201d Kapadia said.",
      "The GOP megabill, which blocks Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed with Medicaid dollars, among other Medicaid cuts, is awaiting its fate in the Senate this week. For now, Title X funding is frozen for Planned Parenthoods in 20 states.",
      "If the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d passes, another 200 of the roughly 600 Planned Parenthoods will be in danger, according to Planned Parenthood.",
      "When Title X funding was cut off to Michigan Planned Parenthood between 2019 and 2021, the number of people seeking preventative care at its locations dropped 75%, Phenicie said.",
      "Although there are other health centers that can pay for visits using Title X funds, they could not absorb the patients Planned Parenthood could no longer see, she added.",
      "In the month leading up to this year\u2019s closures, Planned Parenthood Michigan kept the four closing clinics open to honor all the appointments that had already been made, and spent hours trying to help patients line up care at other clinics or through telehealth with Planned Parenthood.",
      "\u201cEven if they would like to continue care, if they can\u2019t be covered under Title X and they can\u2019t use Medicaid, their options will be limited,\u201d Phenicie said."

    "published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "From centrists worried about Medicaid cuts to conservative hard-liners demanding steeper spending reductions, Senate GOP leaders face a tricky balancing act.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 As Senate Republican leaders push to a massive bill for President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda by July 4, they are juggling a host of competing demands.",
      "Some senators are genuine threats to vote against the legislation, while others are expected to support it in the end after using their demands to shape it. Several of them have complicated political considerations. The Republicans who are speaking out most loudly point to a variety of ways the House-passed bill may change in the Senate, as party leaders seek to ease enough of their concerns.",
      "With all Democrats expected to vote against the package, Republicans will need at least 50 votes to pass it, as Vice President JD Vance could break a tie.",
      "Here are seven key senators to watch.",
      "Rand Paul",
      "Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., is the only Republican senator who has voted against this legislation every step of the way. He has blasted the spike in military spending, the huge increase in deficits and, in particular, the $5 trillion debt limit hike. Paul does support a key part of the package \u2014 an extension of the Trump's 2017 tax cuts \u2014 but he wants to offset it with trillions of dollars in additional spending cuts, which the GOP has no hope of finding consensus on.",
      "Paul typically doesn\u2019t play games with his red lines. Barring an uncharacteristic about face, expect him to vote against the bill.",
      "Susan Collins",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is the sole surviving GOP senator to represent a state that Democrats consistently win at the presidential level. And she faces re-election this year. Her trajectory has been revealing, from supporting the initial budget resolution to voting against the revised version. A key reason for her opposition? Concerns that the Medicaid cuts would harm low-income and elderly constituents.",
      "She also expressed reservations about going after waste and fraud in Medicare, as GOP leaders have begun to consider. In addition, Collins and others like Sen. John Curtis, R-Utah, would firmly oppose overruling the parliamentarian, the Senate\u2019s in-house referee who settles rule disputes, if she disqualifies some policies.",
      "Collins voted for the party's 2017 tax law, but she has been willing to vote against major GOP bills in the past. Party leaders will need to take her demands seriously in order to win her vote.",
      "Lisa Murkowski",
      "When Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted for the budget blueprint in April that kickstarted the process of writing the legislation, she quickly followed it up with a broad set of grievances that will need to be addressed, or she\u2019ll be \u201cunable to support\u201d the final product. Among other things, she took issue with Medicaid cuts and an accounting trick her party is using to obscure the cost of the tax cuts.",
      "Two months later, her concerns persist. Asked Thursday by NBC News what she wants to change in the emerging bill, Murkowski replied dryly, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll give you a list.\u201d",
      "Murkowski has criticized the phaseout and repeal of clean energy tax credits that benefit her state, writing a letter in April with three of her colleagues \u2014 Sens. Jerry Moran, R-Kansas, Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Curtis \u2014 highlighting the importance of America\u2019s energy independence, which they argued could be weakened as a result of this bill.",
      "Murkowski has shown an independent streak and a willingness to take political arrows when standing her ground.",
      "Mike Crapo",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and will help craft some of the biggest and most contentious pieces of the bill \u2014 including the tax cuts and Medicaid cuts. Despite his soft-spoken and non-confrontational style, Crapo won\u2019t be able to make everybody happy.",
      "And any changes he makes in the Senate would have to be palatable to the wafer-thin House Republican majority, which engaged in painstaking negotiations before passing its version of the bill by a one-vote margin.",
      "One example of the disconnect is the expanded $40,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, to placate a group of blue-state House Republicans. But there are no GOP senators representing blue states where that is a big issue. Crapo said \"there's not a strong mood in the Senate Republican caucus right now\" to expand SALT.",
      "The bill represents his biggest test since taking the powerful gavel.",
      "Thom Tillis",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., said he wants to adjust the phaseouts of the clean energy tax credits with a more \u201ctargeted\u201d approach to protect U.S. businesses that are already invested in existing projects. He said there\u2019s \u201cgeneral consensus that the House proposed language will be modified.\u201d Senate Environment and Public Works Chair Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., agreed, telling NBC News some phaseouts will likely be pushed back.",
      "A member of the Finance Committee, Tillis has sounded generally positive about the direction of the bill, making him a likely \u201cyes\u201d vote. But he\u2019s skeptical that the Senate will meet the Independence Day deadline: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things that have to go perfectly right to get all that done and be out by July 4.\u201d",
      "Tillis faces a tough political balancing act: He\u2019s up for re-election next year in a state that Democrats will be targeting; but first he needs to get through a Republican primary, which means staying on Trump\u2019s good side.",
      "Ron Johnson",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., has railed against the bill and its estimated $2.4 trillion contribution to the deficit, insisting he can't vote for it as written. He has slammed the idea of a mega-bill, calling for breaking it up and limiting the debt ceiling hike.",
      "Trump asked him to be \u201cless negative\u201d during a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, Johnson said.",
      "\u201cI think we had a good, lively discussion between the two of us,\u201d Johnson told NBC News. \u201cHe obviously would like me to be a little less negative, a little more positive, which I\u2019m happy to do.\u201d",
      "Johnson said he isn\u2019t trying to make Trump and GOP leaders' jobs harder. And the senator zig-zagged his way to \u201cyes\u201d on the 2017 tax law after initially coming out against it, so party leaders have reason to be optimistic that he won\u2019t sink this legislation.",
      "Josh Hawley",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has been the Senate GOP\u2019s most vocal opponent of cutting Medicaid \"benefits\u201d \u2014 and he's been specific about which parts of the House bill he\u2019s worried about, citing the Medicaid provider tax and cost-sharing provisions.",
      "Notably, Hawley said he's fine with coverage losses resulting from Medicaid work requirements and expanded proof-of-eligibility provisions. Those make up the bulk of the House bill's savings.",
      "Hawley has also expressed reservations about including any provisions in the bill related to Medicare, which Republicans recently said they would discuss related to savings connected to so-called \u201cwaste, fraud, and abuse.\u201d Hawley called that \u201ca terrible idea,\u201d telling reporters Thursday, \u201cIf you don\u2019t ever want to win an election again, just go fiddle around with people\u2019s Medicare that they\u2019ve worked hard for, paid into.\u201d"

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/planned-parenthood-provides-basic-health-care-clinics-close-will-many-rcna210757",
    "published": "Fri, 06 Jun 2025 09:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Citing deep funding cuts, at least 200 Planned Parenthood clinics nationwide are at risk.",
    "story": [
      "When the Trump administration suddenly froze federal funding to more than 100 Planned Parenthood clinics this spring, the organization\u2019s Michigan branch was already deep into hard discussions about its finances.",
      "\u201cThe leadership team and our board had been scenario planning for months to try to fill those gaps to see how we could continue providing care,\u201d said Ashlea Phenicie, chief external affairs officer of Planned Parenthood of Michigan.",
      "The only option was clear. Michigan\u2019s 14 Planned Parenthood clinics serve tens of thousands of women. In order to save clinics around the state that were either busier or in places where women had few other options, the team would have to close multiple clinics, including the only one in the state\u2019s Upper Peninsula, a large, isolated and mostly rural area surrounded by a stretch of Lake Michigan. In Ann Arbor, home of Michigan State University, the city\u2019s two clinics would be combined.",
      "It\u2019s a reality playing out across the country.",
      "At least 20 Planned Parenthood clinics have closed or will close within the year. For decades, the health care organization has been squeezed by the same pressures choking nearly all U.S. providers \u2013\u2013 low insurance reimbursement rates, blocked Medicaid expansion, understaffing and rising costs of providing medical care that have forced hospitals and health clinic closures throughout the country.",
      "Uniquely, Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that serves more than 2 million patients nationwide every year, many of them uninsured, underinsured or who qualify for Medicaid, has also become the target of pointed funding cuts that started under the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cWhat is different this time around is that it\u2019s much more sweeping. It\u2019s a deeper and broader cut that will affect both more clinics and more people,\u201d said Farzana Kapadia, a professor of epidemiology and population health at the New York University School of Global Public Health.",
      "In March, the Trump administration withheld funding by excluding many Planned Parenthood clinics from the Title X family planning program, a federal grant program that funds family planning and reproductive health care. Then, in late May, House Republicans delivered another enormous blow, voting to end funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the reconciliation bill.",
      "Federal law already restricts federal funds from being used for abortion, except in cases of incest, rape or if a mother\u2019s life is in danger, through a law called the Hyde Amendment.",
      "But if passed, the reconciliation bill would cut off Medicaid reimbursement to any nonprofit that primarily offers family planning or reproductive health services, provides abortions beyond the Hyde Amendment exceptions and received more than $1 million in Medicaid reimbursements in 2024. As a nationwide organization, Planned Parenthood does all three.",
      "If the bill passes in the Senate, it would block Planned Parenthood clinics from billing Medicaid for any health services at all, including cancer screenings, wellness exams and birth control. It's unclear if the new legislation would apply to Planned Parenthood nationally or on a state-by-state basis.",
      "Over half of Planned Parenthood patients are covered by publicly funded health programs like Medicaid and in 2023, about 36% of all Title X services were provided by Planned Parenthood clinics. Eliminating these sources of funding would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from Planned Parenthood\u2019s care costs every year. Targeting federal funding for any type of care for Planned Parenthood clinics is a way opponents of abortion rights can attempt to shut down clinics that do provide abortion, even if they also offer other care.",
      "Phenicie said Republican lawmakers appear to understand that cutting off Planned Parenthood from Title X and Medicaid reimbursement will put the clinics that perform abortion in peril, even if these funds can\u2019t cover the procedures. The slashed funds could affect all Planned Parenthood clinics whether they offer abortion services or not.",
      "\u201cThey know so much of our patient base is on Medicaid or needs Title X to pay for their care, they know that cutting this off will allow them to cut off access to abortion and they are willing to make that trade,\u201d she said.",
      "Before the cuts, Planned Parenthood was already operating on thin margins. Now, clinics are struggling to operate at a loss.",
      "\u201cThe numbers are so devastating that there are really no options other than closing some centers and consolidating others, and then investing in our virtual health centers that can serve people across the state,\u201d Phenicie said.",
      "Clinics provide basic health care",
      "At least 1 in 3 women say they have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic for care, as well as 1 in 10 men, according to a recent KFF Health poll. Nearly half of Black women have gone to a Planned Parenthood clinic, the poll found.",
      "Abortions, the main reason the Trump administration has ended support for the clinics, account for just 4% of the services Planned Parenthood provides, according to a 2024 annual report.",
      "The vast majority of Planned Parenthood\u2019s services involve basic health care for women, including diagnosing and treating urinary tract and yeast infections and screening for cervical cancer and breast cancer. Some locations offer vaccination against HPV, hepatitis B, Covid and influenza.",
      "More than half of care is related to testing for sexually transmitted infections and treatment. Another 25% is providing access to contraception, often at low or no cost. Cancer screenings and other non-abortion services make up 18%, the report showed.",
      "Those important medical services haven\u2019t swayed opponents of the clinics.",
      "In January, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., introduced a bill that sought to ban Planned Parenthood from federal funding in the same ways the federal reconciliation bill would. The bill is called the Defund Planned Parenthood Act.",
      "\u201cMy commitment to protecting life isn\u2019t just personal, it\u2019s rooted in both science and principle. Life begins at conception, and I\u2019ve spent my time in the Senate fighting to protect the right to life,\u201d Paul said in a press release.",
      "Closing in states that support abortion rights",
      "About 40% of Planned Parenthood\u2019s funding comes from government health care reimbursements and grants. Many locations offer a sliding scale payment option for people who can\u2019t afford health care. That money comes, in part, from government programs that are now being cut.",
      "\u201cCutting this funding is really about cutting access to care for people who are not insured or who are underinsured to allow for tax breaks for people who can afford their medical care,\u201d NYU\u2019s Kapadia said.",
      "Wendy Stark, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood of Greater New York, said that even when a patient has private insurance, \u201cthe reimbursement rates are just not meeting the costs of primary care.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. health care system pays a tiny amount of health care dollars into primary and preventative care,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWe are sitting in a micro version of that.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Planned Parenthood announced it was selling the building that housed its only Manhattan location. Planned Parenthood locations are also shuttering throughout the Midwest and in other states that have historically voted in favor of abortion rights, including Vermont.",
      "In late May, Planned Parenthood announced it will close four clinics in Minnesota within a year. The state was the first to codify the right to abortion into law after the Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade, but only one of the closing clinics performed abortions.",
      "Four of the six Planned Parenthood clinics in Iowa, including one in Ames, where Iowa State University is located, will also be shuttered. Four Illinois clinics, none which performed abortions, stopped operating in March. In April, three locations closed and two were consolidated in Michigan, where the right to abortion is enshrined into state law. Two Utah locations closed in May after losing a significant amount of funding as a result of the Title X freeze.",
      "\u201cWe are subsidizing almost every visit we do, even with insurance,\u201d Stark said. \u201cWe also have a great deal of our patients who come who do not have insurance.\u201d",
      "The decision to sell the Manhattan clinic was a strategic but difficult decision, she said. The revenue from the sale could help keep other clinics in the state operating. Both the patients and staff of the Manhattan clinic can be absorbed by Planned Parenthood\u2019s other New York City locations, which can minimize the impact the closure will have.",
      "\u201cWhen we consolidate in certain locations, we look at the whole area. Can we funnel patients to our next closest health center, are there other clinics that patients can be sent to?\u201d Stark said, adding that this is more difficult to do in rural areas that already have extremely minimal health care options.",
      "\u201cIf we face further erosion of our finances, we will have to make more hard decisions,\u201d she said.",
      "Straining a fragile health care system",
      "Several state-level laws banned Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds in the decade preceding the sweeping federal exclusions.",
      "Robin Marty, the executive director of WAWC Healthcare, formerly West Alabama Women\u2019s Center, in Tuscaloosa, said these states can provide a picture of what health care may look like in states that have more recently faced Planned Parenthood closures.",
      "\u201cWe exist as kind of a lesson to people of what resources are like if there is not a Planned Parenthood,\u201d she said.",
      "Planned Parenthood operates just one brick-and-mortar clinic in Alabama, in Birmingham, but offers telehealth throughout the state. There are just two in Louisiana and one in the Florida Panhandle.",
      "There are no physical clinics in Mississippi, which has the highest teen birth rate in the nation. Alabama and Louisiana rank in the top seven, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. Mississippi also has the highest maternal mortality rate. Louisiana comes in second. Alabama is fourth.",
      "\u201cThere aren\u2019t places for people to go for free birth control or STI screenings or maternal care,\u201d she said, referring to sexually transmitted infections.",
      "WAWC Healthcare is one of the only providers in Alabama, outside of federally qualified health centers, which are run by states or counties, that does. Already, Marty said, the clinic relies heavily on nongovernmental grants in the absence of access to Title X, though the clinic does accept Medicaid.",
      "\u201cEvery time I apply for a grant, I know I have only about a 10% chance of getting it, but I do it anyway because that\u2019s the only way my patients can get care,\u201d she said. Other than grants, \u201cwe rely on donors who each donate about $50 each time we contact them.\u201d",
      "Marty said other clinics that provide some of the same services as Planned Parenthood, which are already operating on razor-thin margins, if not at a loss, will be further strained by closures. This strain will be passed onto patients.",
      "\u201cYou are talking about individuals who are living at or below the poverty level who already can\u2019t afford health care on their own and then you are eliminating a major source of their health care,\u201d Kapadia said.",
      "The GOP megabill, which blocks Planned Parenthood from being reimbursed with Medicaid dollars, among other Medicaid cuts, is awaiting its fate in the Senate this week. For now, Title X funding is frozen for Planned Parenthoods in 20 states.",
      "If the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d passes, another 200 of the roughly 600 Planned Parenthoods will be in danger, according to Planned Parenthood.",
      "When Title X funding was cut off to Michigan Planned Parenthood between 2019 and 2021, the number of people seeking preventative care at its locations dropped 75%, Phenicie said.",
      "Although there are other health centers that can pay for visits using Title X funds, they could not absorb the patients Planned Parenthood could no longer see, she added.",
      "In the month leading up to this year\u2019s closures, Planned Parenthood Michigan kept the four closing clinics open to honor all the appointments that had already been made, and spent hours trying to help patients line up care at other clinics or through telehealth with Planned Parenthood.",
      "\u201cEven if they would like to continue care, if they can\u2019t be covered under Title X and they can\u2019t use Medicaid, their options will be limited,\u201d Phenicie said."

      "Such clans often wield some control in corners of Gaza, and some have had clashes or tensions with Hamas in the past.

      "Despite the disruption of Oklahoma City\u2019s defense, and the 15-point lead it built with nine minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, the Thunder found themselves in the final minutes just like Milwaukee, Cleveland and New York before it \u2014 unable, ultimately, to figure out how to put away a Pacers team that simply will not quit.",
      "Indiana led, in total, for three-tenths of a second in Game 1, but that was enough for a 111-110 victory that saw what would have been an inexplicable comeback for any other team became an inevitable Pacers hallmark. It was the third consecutive series in which they authored a stunning series-opening victory on the road by remaining cool in the clutch.",
      "\u201cThey went up 15 and we just said, hey, just keep chipping away at the rock,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said postgame. \u201cJust chip away and hang in. And we have a lot of experience in these kinds of games. Our guys have a real good feel for what it\u2019s all about, giving ourselves a chance. We got fortunate, but made plays.\u201d",
      "Indiana committed 17 more turnovers than Oklahoma City and took 16 fewer shots.",
      "\u201cNot the recipe to win,\u201d said Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton, whose 21-foot jumper with 0.3 of a second left was his fourth game-winner of this postseason.",
      "Haliburton admitted to feeling nerves before tipoff and also rushed as he took only four shots during the first half \u2014 14 fewer than his superstar guard counterpart Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the new NBA Most Valuable Player. Gilgeous-Alexander would finish with 38 points, more than Haliburton (14) and co-star Pascal Siakam (19) combined as Thunder guard Lu Dort, who had defended Haliburton tougher than anyone else during two decisive Thunder wins in the regular season, continued to throttle the engine of the Pacers\u2019 offense.",
      "Inside a Paycom Center atmosphere that Carlisle described as \u201cmadness,\u201d Indiana\u2019s start was as ominous as the thunderstorm that rolled through this city before tipoff, dumping buckets of rain on fans who ran through ankle-deep puddles into the arena. Early in the second quarter, Indiana had already exceeded its per-game average for turnovers (13). The Thunder entered Thursday 43-4 when forcing more than 10 steals this season. They had that many before halftime.",
      "Indiana trailed by only 12 points at halftime, then turned the ball over just twice in the third quarter, but could never quite close the gap. When Oklahoma City\u2019s Jalen Williams stole an inbounds pass with 9:42 to play and ran the interception the length of the court for a dunk and a 94-79 lead, an arena that had waited 13 years to host another Finals game erupted.",
      "But the Pacers did not implode. The only thing more improbable than another Pacers comeback was that their defense, an enormous liability as recently as December, was critical in making it happen. Indiana allowed just two points in the final 2:50, and limited Oklahoma City to just 46 points inside the paint despite taking 54 shots there.",
      "\u201cWe had control of the game for the most part of it,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cIt is a 48-minute game. They teach you that lesson more than anyone else in the league the hard way.\u201d",
      "And the Pacers have made a habit of winning the hard way. Indiana is the first team since 1998 with five playoff comebacks of at least 15 points. The team has been so consistent at it that they now anticipate postgame questions about how, exactly, they pull improbable victories off.",
      "\u201cOur biggest thing is our response,\u201d Pacers center Myles Turner said. \u201cWe know things are going to go bad at times, and not look good but you got to be even keel. Calm waters.\u201d",
      "More from the NBA Finals",
      "NBA Finals: Tyrese Haliburton, Pacers stun Thunder with late comeback to win Game 1Thunder superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was an MVP hiding in plain sightCaitlin Clark, Tyrese Maxey, the basketball and sports worlds react to Tyrese Haliburton\u2019s game-winner",

      "Thunder superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was an MVP hiding in plain sight",
      "Caitlin Clark, Tyrese Maxey, the basketball and sports worlds react to Tyrese Haliburton\u2019s game-winner",
      "With sunglasses on, and facing four rows of reporters and cameras late Thursday, Haliburton sat behind a microphone and linked his team\u2019s growing resume of rallies to something deeper than play execution or shot-making. Since he was a teenager, Haliburton has collected slights, and even bookmarked social-media insults about himself, as an accountability check, to never allow himself to get complacent. That appears to have rubbed off on teammates who also \u201cdo a great job of taking things personal,\u201d Haliburton said.",
      "\u201cAfter you have a run like last year when you get swept in the Eastern Conference Finals, and all the conversation is about is how you don\u2019t belong there and how you lucked out to get there, and that it was a fluke, guys are going to be pissed off,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cAnd then you come into the year with all the talk around how it was a fluke, you have an unsuccessful first couple months and now that\u2019s easy for everybody to clown you, talk about you in a negative way.",
      "\u201cAnd I think as a group, we take everything personal. It\u2019s not just me, it\u2019s everybody. I feel like that\u2019s the DNA of this group. And that\u2019s not just me. Our coaching staff does a great job of making us aware of what\u2019s being said. Us as players, we talk about it in the locker room, we talk about it on the plane. We\u2019re a young team, so we probably spend more time on social media than we should. But I just think we do a great job of taking things personal, and that gives this group more confidence.\u201d",
      "For the Pacers, it was just another postseason win in which the remarkable has become routine, because though they are fallible, as Thursday proved, no opponent has yet solved how to break the Pacers over a seven-game series. They never stop, and still were not in the afterglow of Game 1. As dozens of reporters funneled down a hallway to Indiana\u2019s locker room, a Pacers assistant coach cut against the flow going the other direction, out of the arena, his expression more serious than celebratory.",
      "\u201cOn to the next one,\u201d the coach said."

      "Winsome Earle-Sears, the all-but-certain Republican nominee in the Virginia governor\u2019s race this fall, has built the early stages of her campaign around being Gov. Glenn Youngkin\u2019s partner.",
      "Earle-Sears, the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, has largely attempted to frame her candidacy as an extension of the current administration, an attempt to replicate the term-limited governor\u2019s path to victory in the blue-leaning state four years ago.",
      "\u201cTogether, we\u2019ve fought for parents, backed the blue, and delivered real results for Virginians. Now, it\u2019s time to keep that momentum going,\u201d Earle-Sears, referring to Youngkin, wrote in a Facebook post earlier this year.",
      "But there has been notable daylight between Earle-Sears and Youngkin on several fronts, particularly on social issues, complicating her strategy to follow in the footsteps of her more popular governing partner.",
      "\u201cShe is definitely trying to have it all ways,\u201d said a Republican operative in Virginia, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about Earle-Sears.",
      "Most prominently, Earle-Sears has made clear she is not fully aligned with Youngkin on a pair of hot-button social issues: same-sex marriage and abortion rights.",
      "Last year, Youngkin signed legislation protecting marriage equality in Virginia. But Earle-Sears left a handwritten note on the bill stating she was \u201cmorally opposed\u201d to the legislation.",
      "Following the bill\u2019s passage through both chambers of the Legislature, Earle-Sears wrote on the physical copy, \u201cAs the Lt. Governor, I recognize and respect my constitutional obligation to adhere to the procedures laid out in the Constitution of Virginia. However, I remain morally opposed to the contents of HB174 as passed by the General Assembly.\u201d",
      "Earle-Sears doubled down on separating herself from Youngkin\u2019s position on the issue in a recent interview, telling a local news outlet in Richmond last month that she was \u201cfine\u201d with civil unions but refused to say she supported same-sex marriage.",
      "She\u2019s also out of step with Youngkin\u2019s positioning on abortion rights.",
      "In 2023, Youngkin proposed a 15-week ban on abortion in the state, which included exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother, in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to help the GOP carve out a less severe \u201cconsensus\u201d bill restricting reproductive rights.",
      "For her part, Earle-Sears has supported a ban at six weeks, or when fetal cardiac activity is detected \u2014 a point at which most women don\u2019t even know they are pregnant \u2014 and with fewer exceptions.",
      "While she got behind Youngkin\u2019s 15-week ban in 2023, she left another handwritten note on a measure passed by the Legislature earlier this year to send to voters a proposed constitutional amendment that would enshrine the state\u2019s abortion protections.",
      "\u201cI am morally opposed to this bill; no protection for the child,\u201d she wrote. She has also in the past called abortion \u201cgenocide\u201d and vowed to \u201cdo everything in my power\u201d to end abortion in Virginia.",
      "Youngkin managed to shift the focus elsewhere during his 2021 campaign \u2014 and has largely had to continue doing so as governor, as he\u2019s dealt with a Democratic-controlled Legislature. But the fact that he staked out middle ground on social issues has only further highlighted Earle-Sears\u2019 more conservative positioning.",
      "In addition, Earle-Sears has faced criticism for her approach to the plight of federal workers in Virginia who have been affected by President Donald Trump\u2019s moves to shrink the size of government via the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "She praised those efforts earlier this year, saying she was \u201cglad\u201d Trump was \u201cgetting to the bottom\u201d of alleged waste and fraud in the federal government. While she has often pointed to the Youngkin administration\u2019s investments in the private sector of the Virginia economy as a reason workers need not worry, she has also said she would help Trump \u201cget the job done\u201d on the issue. And she downplayed the federal layoffs at an event in March, saying, \u201cThe media is making it out to be a huge, huge thing \u2014 and I don\u2019t understand why.\u201d",
      "Youngkin, on the other hand, has said he wants to \u201ccushion\u201d his state\u2019s economy from the effects of DOGE and earlier this year was frequently touting a website his administration created that effectively serves as a job board \u2014 while also praising DOGE.",
      "Earle-Sears\u2019 positions stand in contrast to the relative political middle ground Youngkin has famously staked out in Virginia \u2014 efforts that have contributed to a record of strong approval ratings for the Republican governor in a state that Kamala Harris carried last year by about 6 percentage points.",
      "Last month, though, a Roanoke College poll found a 44% favorability rating for Youngkin among registered voters, versus 50% who view him unfavorably \u2014 his worst showing in that particular poll, and a possible indication that the broader GOP brand could be facing trouble in Virginia.",
      "But Earle-Sears had lower marks, with only 32% viewing her favorably and 48% saying they had an unfavorable view. Another 20% of respondents said they had no opinion of her. And the poll showed Democrat Abigail Spanberger leading Earle-Sears in the governor\u2019s race by 17 points.",
      "Political operatives in the state from both parties told NBC News these notable departures by Earle-Sears \u2014 particularly on social issues \u2014 risk turning off large chunks of voters in the political center that she\u2019d need to hold together Youngkin\u2019s winning coalition from four years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s her core promise to the voter? It should be pretty simple: \u2018Things are going good. Let\u2019s keep it going\u2019 \u2014 but she gets distracted,\u201d the Republican operative said.",
      "Democratic Party of Virginia spokesperson Maggie Amjad said these issues, and others, show that Earle-Sears \u201cis a far-right candidate with a long record that\u2019s out of step with Virginians.\u201d",
      "Representatives for both Earle-Sears and Youngkin downplayed any differences in their political views and emphasized that Youngkin\u2019s strengths as governor still extended to Earle-Sears and other Republicans on the ballot in Virginia this fall.",
      "\u201cThe media\u2019s obsession with creating division where there isn\u2019t any won\u2019t change the fact that the Youngkin-Sears Administration is one of the most popular in Virginia\u2019s history \u2014 that\u2019s no accident,\u201d Earle-Sears campaign press secretary Peyton Vogel said in an email to NBC News. \u201cThey share a commitment to common-sense leadership, individual liberty, and getting government out of the way. Winsome has been a vital part of this administration, and will continue to bring ideas to the table that better the lives of Virginians across the Commonwealth as Governor just as she has during her time as Lieutenant Governor.\u201d",
      "Justin Discigil, a spokesperson for Youngkin\u2019s Spirit of Virginia PAC, said in an email that \u201cYoungkin has delivered for Virginians with record tax relief, record job growth, and record investments in education, law enforcement, behavioral health, and other shared priorities,\u201d and that Earle-Sears \u201cand all Virginia Republicans have a record to run on with proven results.\u201d",
      "A challenging political landscape",
      "Earle-Sears\u2019 positioning on social issues and DOGE could further complicate what had already emerged as an uphill climb for Republicans to keep control of the governorship.",
      "Earle-Sears has already faced a torrent of criticism for running an undisciplined campaign. And Spanberger, her opponent, is widely seen as a strong candidate who has won several competitive House races.",
      "The GOP also faces historical headwinds: In 11 of the last 12 Virginia gubernatorial races, voters elected the candidate of the party out of power in the White House.",
      "Republicans view Youngkin\u2019s 2021 victory as the product of a unique candidate who was able to benefit from the anger and fatigue over the Covid-19 pandemic and remote learning in public schools. Strategists said that will be difficult to replicate this year.",
      "\u201cHe just simply makes the main thing the main thing, and he\u2019s extremely disciplined about it. Everything fits into \u2018make Virginia the best place to live, work and raise a family.\u2019 He puts everything into the common sense bucket, the kitchen-table issue bucket. That\u2019s where he lives. That\u2019s why his approval ratings are always pretty high,\u201d said Virginia-based Republican strategist Zack Roday, who previously worked with Youngkin through his Spirit of Virginia PAC but is not working with the Earle-Sears campaign.",
      "Roday, along with other Virginia GOP strategists, suggested that Earle-Sears hadn\u2019t yet displayed the same political strengths.\u200b\u200b",
      "Meanwhile, Democrats signaled they were preparing to seize on another difference they said would be meaningful to Virginia voters: how each candidate handled Trump during their campaign.",
      "Throughout the 2021 campaign, Youngkin notably kept his distance from Trump, who was at a political low point following his loss to Joe Biden and the fallout from the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. While Youngkin has since cultivated a much more public and close relationship with Trump in the years since, operatives from both major parties credited that distance during that campaign as another reason he won.",
      "Earle-Sears has so far voiced full-throated support for Trump.",
      "Earle-Sears \u201cis only focused on appeasing Trump and pushing an extreme agenda that\u2019s wrong for Virginia,\u201d said Amjad."

      "Even if the job numbers beat forecasts, other data are already pointing to signs of a softening economy.",
      "On Wednesday, private payroll processor ADP reported the weakest monthly jobs total since March 2023. While economists say ADP\u2019s data often align with the official BLS data, the trend is clear, with ADP reporting fewer jobs added in five of the past seven months.",

      "The State Department said Thursday that it would freeze any assets that the ICC judges, who come from Benin, Peru, Slovenia and Uganda, have in U.S. jurisdictions. The move is just the latest step that the administration has taken to punish the ICC and its officials for investigations undertaken against Israel and the United States.",
      "\u201cAs ICC judges, these four individuals have actively engaged in the ICC\u2019s illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America or our close ally, Israel,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe ICC is politicized and falsely claims unfettered discretion to investigate, charge, and prosecute nationals of the United States and our allies,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis dangerous assertion and abuse of power infringes upon the sovereignty and national security of the United States and our allies, including Israel.\u201d",

      "The new sanctions target ICC Judge Reine Alapini-Gansou, who is from the West African country of Benin and was part of the pre-trial chamber of judges who issued the arrest warrant for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last year. She also served on the bench that originally greenlit the investigation into alleged Israeli crimes in the Palestinian territories in 2021.",

      "From Slovenia, Beti Hohler was elected as a judge in 2023. She previously worked in the prosecutor\u2019s office at the court, leading Israel to object to her participation in the proceedings involving Israeli officials.

Israel strongly denies the allegations.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump targeted the ICC with sanctions, voicing displeasure with investigations into Israel and complaints about alleged war crimes said to have been committed by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Those sanctions were rescinded by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration in early 2021.",
      "Rubio said the U.S. would continue to take action to protect its and Israel\u2019s interests at the court. \u201cThe United States will take whatever actions we deem necessary to protect our sovereignty, that of Israel, and any other U.S. ally from illegitimate actions by the ICC,\u201d he said.",
      "Liz Evenson, international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said the Trump administration\u2019s sanctions \u201caim to deter the ICC from seeking accountability amid grave crimes committed in Israel and Palestine, and as Israeli atrocities mount in Gaza, including with U.S. complicity.\u201d",

      "Spaghetti, Macaroni and Rigatoni, meanwhile, were just 2 weeks old when the good folks of LIC Feral Feeders, a cat rescue in Queens, took them in and bottle-fed them until they were strong enough to survive.",
      "Consider these cuties the face of kitten season 2025.",
      "Kitten season, typically landing during warmer months, is the time of year when most cats give birth. That produces a surge of kittens, often fragile neonates. Shelters get overwhelmed, especially when it comes to the 24-hour care and feeding of extremely young kittens.",
      "That, as a result, triggers a need for more foster homes because many of the 4,000 or so shelters in the U.S. don't have the time or resources for around-the-clock care, said Hannah Shaw, an animal welfare advocate known as the Kitten Lady with more than a million followers on Instagram.",

There's a false perception, she said, that the expense of fostering animals falls on the people who step up to do it.

      "\"A lot of people don't foster because they think it's going to be this huge cost, but fostering actually only costs you time and love,\" she said.",
      "Lisa Restine, a Hill's Pet Nutrition veterinarian, said people looking to adopt kittens should take pairs since cats often bond early in life. And how many cats is too many cats per household?",
      "\"This is nothing serious or medical but my general rule of thumb is the number of adults in the house, like a 2-to-1 ratio, because you can carry one cat in each hand, so if there are two adults you can have four cats and still be sane,\" she said.",
      "Square footage to avoid territory disputes is a good rule of thumb when planning for cats, Restine said. Two cats per 800 square feet then 200 square feet more for each addition should help, she said.",
      "Littermates, like Macaroni and Rigatoni, are much more likely to bond, Restine said. Kittens not biologically related but raised together often bond as well \u2014 like Meatball and Spaghetti. But adopters hoping to bond an adult cat with a new kitten arrival may be disappointed.",
      "\"Once they're over that 3- or 4-month mark, it's hard to get that true bonding,\" Restine said.",
      "Typically, kittens stay in their foster homes from a few weeks to a few months. While statistics are not kept on the number of kitten fosters that \"fail\" \u2014 when foster families decided to keep their charges \u2014 some shelters report rates as high as 90%. That's a win, despite use of the word \"fail,\" advocates note.",
      "Shaw sees another barrier holding people back from fostering: the notion that it requires special training or skills. That's why she has dedicated her life to educating the public, offering videos, books and research on how it works at her site kittenlady.org.",
      "Companies are coming on board, too. Hill's, a pet food company, runs the Hill's Food, Shelter & Love program. It has provided more than $300 million in food support to over 1,000 animal shelters that support fostering in North America.",
      "\"About a quarter of a million kittens, unfortunately, don't survive in our shelters every year,\" Shaw said. \"The shelter's going to be there to mentor and support you. So I think a lot of the fear that people have about fostering, they might find that actually it is something you totally can do. It's just scary because you haven't done it yet.\""

    "story": [
      "LOS ANGELES \u2014 A Los Angeles sheriff's deputy will serve four months in prison on a misdemeanor conviction for using excessive force after the new Trump-appointed U.S. attorney offered an unusual plea deal despite a jury convicting him of a felony.",
      "The victim's attorney asked a federal appeals court to reinstate the felony conviction, but the court declined to do so on Thursday.",
      "Deputy Trevor Kirk was recorded tackling and pepper-spraying an older woman while she filmed a man being handcuffed outside a supermarket in June 2023. A federal jury in February found Kirk guilty of one felony count of deprivation of rights under color of law, a crime that carries a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Felony convictions also prevent law enforcement officials from continuing to serve or owning a gun.",
      "But when U.S. Attorney Bill Essayli took office a few months later, federal prosecutors offered Kirk a plea deal \u2014 a dismissal of the felony if Kirk pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, and a recommendation of one year of probation. A judge agreed to the lessened charge but sentenced Kirk to four months in prison on Monday.",
      "Essayli said in a video posted online that prosecutors also offered Kirk a misdemeanor plea agreement under the prior administration, which he turned down.",
      "\"After reviewing this case extensively and thoroughly and carefully reviewing the facts and the law, I made the decision to re-extend the misdemeanor plea agreement to Deputy Kirk,\" Essayli said.",
      "In court filings signed off by Essayli, prosecutors wrote they believed that Kirk's actions fell on the lower end of the excessive force spectrum, the woman did not suffer \"serious bodily injury,\" and that the case was prosecuted improperly.",
      "Some former prosecutors and police conviction experts called the step highly unusual, especially without any indication of prosecutorial misconduct, ethical violations or new evidence in the case. It follows President Donald Trump's vow to \"protect and defend\" law enforcement officers from prosecution and his efforts to assert greater control over the U.S. Justice Department.",
      "\"It's very unusual to offer a plea deal after a conviction,\" said Jeffrey Bellin, a former federal prosecutor from Washington, D.C., who is now a law professor at William and Mary Law School. In cases where it could happen, there's usually new evidence of innocence, \"not just the same evidence from a different perspective,\" he said.",
      "Kirk's attorney, Tom Yu, said they filed a motion for acquittal that was denied but planned to appeal the decision.",
      "The encounter",
      "Caree Harper, who represents the woman Kirk injured, said in court filings that the federal government changed its account of the incident to make Kirk's actions seem justified.",
      "In the original indictment, prosecutors wrote Kirk \"violently\" threw the woman to the ground. In the new plea agreement, the government alleged the woman \"swatted\" at Kirk and \"resisted,\" Harper wrote, which she said was not proven in the criminal trial nor testified to in civil litigation.",
      "She said her client did not commit a crime, had no weapon, and did not try to flee or resist. She suffered from a black eye, a fractured bone in her right wrist, multiple bruises, scratches and significant chemical burning from the pepper-spray.",
      "Harper said the plea agreement sent a \"dangerous message\" that law enforcement officials could be convicted of a felony and still \"cut a backroom deal after the trial.\"",
      "Philip Stinson, a former police officer and attorney who studies police misconduct, said the plea deal offered to Kirk was \"seemingly without precedent\" in federal court cases prosecuting police officers for their on-duty crimes, according to his search of an internal database of more than 24,000 arrest cases in the last 20 years involving sworn law enforcement officers.",
      "LA County Sheriff's Department spokesperson Nicole Nishida said Kirk will remain employed with the agency but relieved from duty while it conducts an internal investigation to determine if any policy or procedures were violated.",
      "A new approach by federal prosecutors",
      "Kirk's case is the latest showing the Trump administration's plan to take a lighter hand in the federal government's traditional role in prosecuting police misconduct. Trump's April executive order on policing promised the \"unleashing\" of law enforcement and support for their legal defense.",
      "The Justice Department announced in May it was canceling proposed consent decrees reached with Minneapolis and Louisville to implement policing reforms in the wake of the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The department also announced it would retract its findings in six other sweeping investigations into police departments that the Biden administration had accused of civil rights violations.",
      "Trump-appointed federal judges have also played a hand in dismissing cases against police officers, including murder charges against a former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed an unarmed man hiding in a closet in 2019.",
      "Experts say the reliance on the federal government to perform this policing oversight comes from the close relationship between local prosecutors and police officers, who regularly work together to investigate crimes.",
      "\"We are often looking at the federal government to serve as a check and balance for local law enforcement officials who are accused of really egregious activity toward the public,\" said Devin Hart, a spokesperson for the National Police Accountability Project.",
      "All four members of the original prosecutors withdrew from the case after the new plea deal was presented, and at least one resigned from the office, according to court filings. Two others took the buyout offered to federal employees, spokesperson Ciaran McEvoy confirmed."

    "story": [
      "A private lunar lander from Japan crashed while attempting a touchdown Friday, the latest casualty in the commercial rush to the moon.",
      "The Tokyo-based company ispace declared the mission a failure several hours after communication was lost with the lander. Flight controllers scrambled to gain contact, but were met with only silence and said they were concluding the mission.",
      "Communications ceased less than two minutes before the spacecraft\u2019s scheduled landing on the moon with a mini rover. Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace.",
      "Two years ago, the company\u2019s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name \u201cResilience\u201d for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist\u2019s toy-size red house for placement on the moon\u2019s dusty surface.",
      "Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions.",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,\u201d Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions.",
      "A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. \u201cBased on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,\u201d the company said in a written statement.",
      "Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.",
      "Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.",
      "Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and was declared dead within hours.",
      "Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side\u2019s northern tier.",
      "Plans had called for the 7.5-foot Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.",
      "Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace\u2019s European-built rover \u2014 named Tenacious \u2014 sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.",
      "The rover, weighing just 11 pounds, was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight.",
      "Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch.",
      "The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.",
      "Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. \u201cEngineers did everything they possibly could\u201d to ensure success this time, he said.",
      "He considered the latest moonshot \u201cmerely a steppingstone\u201d to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement.",
      "Ispace, like other businesses, does not have \u201cinfinite funds\u201d and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month.",
      "While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it\u2019s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.",
      "Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year\u2019s end: Jeff Bezos\u2018 Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic\u2019s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere."

      "The diagnosis comes against the backdrop of Paramount preparing for an $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media, which still requires U.S. FCC approval.

    "story": [
      "David Hyde Pierce is no stranger to the theater. In fact, he\u2019s been performing onstage for decades.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s where I started. Before I ever got into television, I was doing theater,\u201d Pierce explains in a sit-down interview with TODAY.com.",
      "Best known for his turn as Dr. Niles Crane on the TV sitcom \u201cFrasier,\u201d a role that earned him four Primetime Emmys and scores of other award nominations, Pierce is once again returning to his roots in the Broadway musical \u201cPirates! The Penzance Musical.\u201d",
      "The limited-run show, which stars Pierce along with Ramin Karimloo and Jinkx Monsoon, is a spirited and joyful revival of the Gilbert and Sullivan classic \u201cThe Pirates of Penzance,\u201d and is nominated for a 2025 Tony Award for best revival of a musical.",
      "The 66-year-old actor portrays Major-General Stanley, the good-natured, if occasionally clueless, father of eight daughters and a former military general, naturally.",
      "\u201cI sort of look like Cap'n Crunch on a bender in this production,\u201d he laughs of his \u201cPenzance\u201d costume.",
      "Pierce delivers one of the show\u2019s marquee numbers, \u201cI Am the Very Model of a Modern Major-General,\u201d an entertaining patter song known for its tongue-twisting, rapid-fire lyrics.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a tricky song, it\u2019s a lot of words, it\u2019s fast and there aren\u2019t a lot of places to breathe,\u201d Pierce says of the tune.",
      "Was it difficult to learn?",
      "\u201cIn early previews, I really had to focus to get it right,\u201d he says of the challenge, noting that it\u2019s since become easier since he performs it so often.",
      "\u201cI still run it every time before I do the show. I don\u2019t take it for granted,\u201d says Pierce. \u201cBut it\u2019s just like the production is for any of us in the show. It\u2019s in your bones in a way. So, then you can have fun and you can just sort of relax and enjoy and share it with either the people onstage or the people in the audience, or both.\u201d",
      "Even so, there\u2019s still at least one part of the song Pierce says was initially a bit of a \u201cspeed bump.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are two sections that have very similar wording. One line says, \u2018I\u2019m very well acquainted\u2019 and the other line says, \u2018I\u2019m very good at.\u2019 What happens is, if you inadvertently reverse them, then you\u2019re screwed because the subsequent lines don\u2019t lead and you end up in a loop and having to sing the song a hundred times.\u201d",
      "\u2018Frasier\u2019 vs. \u2018Pirates!\u2019",
      "Fortunately, according to Pierce, he\u2019s since \u201cgot it down,\u201d and he enjoys the thrill of performing in front of an audience night after night \u2014 an experience he says differs from his time on \u201cFrasier,\u201d which aired for 11 seasons from 1993 to 2004.",
      "\u201c\u2018Frasier\u2019 shot in front of a live audience, so in that aspect, it was very much like theater. Many of us in the show were theater actors and the show was written like little plays every week,\u201d recalls Pierce.",
      "But despite the similarities, he says live theater is different in that there are no second takes or post-edits and each performance is its own unique experience.",
      "\u201cThat one-time event ... that\u2019s it,\u201d says the actor, who continues by saying that even though he and the cast do the same show \u201cevery night, eight times a week,\u201d it\u2019s different every single time.",
      "\u201cThere was one matinee we had where there was a little girl. I did not see her, she was way in the back of the main section and she just thought the \u2018Major-General\u2019 song was the funniest thing she\u2019d ever heard,\u201d Pierce recalls.",
      "\u201cAnd every time there was a pause in the song, the whole house could hear this little, deeply moved giggle coming from this little girl. Of course, every one of us onstage was charmed by that because it\u2019s just so pure and innocent. It was like she\u2019s watching a Muppet who was talking a mile a minute, and it\u2019s one of my great memories of the show.\u201d",
      "Performing at the 2025 Tony Awards",
      "Pierce and the rest of the cast will perform at this year\u2019s Tonys, which will be held on Sunday, June 8, something Pierce says they\u2019ve been preparing for in addition to their daily \u201cPirates!\u201d shows.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the most amazing thing,\u201d he says of the opportunity. \u201cBut what that means is we do weeks of rehearsal for just over three minutes of airtime for the number.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not Pierce\u2019s first time appearing at the Tonys. In fact, in 2007, he took home the trophy for best leading actor in a musical for his role in the music comedy \u201cCurtains,\u201d and was nominated for his performance in the 2017 revival of \u201cHello, Dolly!\u201d starring Bette Midler, among other credits.",
      "And while he\u2019s happy to be there once again, he says the real joy comes from seeing his fellow castmates experience it for the first time.",
      "\u201cTo be onstage with these kids, some of whom are making their Broadway debuts, most of whom have never been to the Tony Awards, to see them levitate and then explode in the air when they got the news that we're going to do a number on the Tonys was so thrilling and rejuvenating and just reminded me how much this means in our world.\u201d",
      "As for Pierce, he says it only takes getting into costume for him to feel like he's in the zone and ready to perform: \"When I'm at the theater, I feel like I'm home.\"",
      "\u201cPirates! The Penzance Musical\u201d is currently playing at the Todd Haimes Theatre and runs through July 27, 2025."

      "But then the mom of four added, \"I'm still not a hundred percent sure what the difference between a Type B and a Type C is. I'm going to be totally honest with you. But I'm somewhere in there. I'm definitely not Type A. I can tell you that for certain.\"",
      "Well, Kylie, since you're still juggling a newborn, stockpiling multiple Chapsticks and pursuing cat adoption, TODAY.com will break it down for you.",
      "What is a Type C Mom?",
      "As Kelce noted on her podcast, Type C moms have been making their presence known on social media recently.",
      "Content creator Ashleigh Surratt, who labels herself a \"Type C\" mom in her profile, has a series of videos demonstrating her behavior.",
      "The videos \u2014 with Surratt showing off a perfectly styled snack tray in the middle of a messy kitchen, for example \u2014 are relatable for a lot of moms.",
      "But on an April 29 Instagram reel, Surratt confessed that she \"completely made up\" her depiction of a \"Type C\" mom.",
      "\"To me it\u2019s a joke about being really 'Type A' about some things and 'Type B' about others. It\u2019s planners and piles of laundry. It\u2019s color coding and cluttered counters,\" she wrote in the video caption.",
      "Surratt may have invented her version of a \"Type C\" mom ... but they do exist.",
      "In a recent interview with TODAY.com, Colette Brown, a licensed psychotherapist in New York City, said \u201cType C\u201d moms are similar to \u201cType A\u201d in that they\u2019re detail-oriented; however, they are flexible. So in that way, they really are a mix of structured \"Type A\" moms and go-with-the-flow \"Type B\" moms, just as Surratt assumed.",
      "The kids of a \"Type C\" mom \"might not have matching socks but they\u2019re good about meal planning ... even if it\u2019s breakfast for dinner,\u201d Brown added.",
      "So far, this seems very Kylie Kelce.",

      "If there's one thing we know about supermom Kelce, it's that she is never afraid to speak her mind. In fact, she began her whole podcast so that she could better control the media narrative surrounding her family.",
      "Is Kylie Kelce a \u201cType B\u201d Mom?",
      "In a recent interview with TODAY.com, Brown said that \u201cType B moms are laid-back, relaxed, and have lots of patience \u2014 they don\u2019t mind chaos.\u201d Plus, Brown added, \u201cThey are emotionally supportive.\u201d",
      "Think unfinished house projects, unscheduled weekends and Goldfish scattered around the minivan. Unlike perfectionistic \u201cType A\u201d moms, \u201cType B\u201d moms don\u2019t need to check everything off a list. In fact, they would never make a list in the first place.",
      "Kelce does seem to have some \u201cType B\u201d tendencies in that she is laidback and rolls with disruption. For example, she recorded an entire podcast with a 2-day-old baby in her arms.",
      "But Kelce has one thing that \u201cType B\u201d moms don\u2019t tend to have: a plan.",
      "So, What Mom Type is Kylie Kelce?",
      "Like virtually all of us, Kelce falls somewhere within these mom personality types. She is not completely one or the other.",
      "She has the unflappable quality of a \"Type B\" mom, and she is both detail-oriented and flexible like a \u201cType C\u201d mom.",
      "Kelce herself described her mom type best when chatting with TODAY.com in April 2024: \u201cIt\u2019s really chaotic, but it ends up being a well-orchestrated chaos.\u201d"

      "If the baby is Joe\u2019s, Season 4 could reframe their connection \u2014 and potentially reignite a romance Georgia never fully let go.",
      "Did Georgia Really Turn Herself In?",
      "In one of the finale\u2019s most ambiguous scenes, Georgia says she turned herself in for Tom\u2019s death. But even that confession might be a lie.",
      "\u201cShe says she turned herself in, but Gil questions it,\u201d Glinski says. \u201cCould she have lied? Ginny doesn\u2019t know. That\u2019s a very telling moment.\u201d",
      "Georgia has always existed in a moral gray zone, and this moment proves she\u2019s still capable of manipulating even those closest to her. What\u2019s real \u2014 and what\u2019s just her version of the truth?",
      "Can Ginny Live With Her Lie?",
      "Ginny crosses a line when she convinces her younger brother, Austin, to lie in court to protect their mother. It works \u2014 Georgia walks free. But at what cost?",
      "\u201cShe pulled a Georgia,\u201d Antonia Gentry, who plays Ginny, tells TODAY.com. \u201cShe manipulated her little brother because she felt like she had no other option.\u201d",
      "The fallout could be devastating, especially for Austin, whose silence and erratic behavior hint at deeper trauma. Will he crack under the pressure? And what happens if he tells the truth?",
      "Will Cynthia Strike Back?",
      "Georgia may have thought she was doing Cynthia a favor by ending her husband\u2019s suffering, but Cynthia never asked for that kind of help.",
      "\u201cGeorgia sees herself as protecting Cynthia and her son,\u201d Lampert says. \u201cBut from Cynthia\u2019s POV? Georgia killed her husband. That\u2019s not something you just move past.\u201d",

      "Is Paul Done with Georgia or Planning His Revenge?",
      "After learning of Georgia\u2019s betrayal, Paul resigns as mayor and walks out of their marriage. But something about his quiet exit feels ... unfinished.",
      "Will Paul return to seek custody of the baby (if the child is his)? Or worse \u2014 will he use his political clout to dismantle Georgia\u2019s world from the outside?",
      "As calm as Paul seems, he now understands the full extent of Georgia\u2019s darkness. That makes him unpredictable and  potentially dangerous.",
      "Is Ginny Becoming Georgia?",
      "By the end of Season 3, Ginny is no longer the moral compass of the show. She lies, manipulates and sacrifices her brother\u2019s innocence to protect her mom. Sound familiar?",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s totally becoming a mini Georgia,\u201d Gentry says. \u201cEven Georgia is like, \u2018Oh, no, what have I done?\u2019\u201d",

      "From the courtroom stunt to the mayoral scandal, the Miller family has stirred up enough drama to fracture the entire town. As Lampert says, \u201cWellsbury might not be so welcoming anymore.\u201d",
      "Season 4 could pit the Millers against the very community they tried to blend into, raising the stakes for everyone, especially Ginny and Austin."

      "Earlier in the season, Georgia lied about a pregnancy to manipulate Paul into showing up to court. Paul suspects the child is not his, and when he learns the truth, he leaves her.",
      "So now that Georgia may actually be pregnant, this raises immediate questions \u2014 mainly, who\u2019s the father? Especially following Georgia\u2019s emotionally charged moment with Joe (Raymond Ablack), her longtime confidant and the only man who truly gets the truth from the start.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to get messy,\u201d Howey teases. \u201cAnd on this show, nothing is ever simple.\u201d",

      "Meanwhile, Ginny\u2019s end to the season is more strategic \u2014 and dangerous. Ginny convinces her little brother, Austin, to lie under oath and say Austin\u2019s abusive father, Gil, killed Tom. It\u2019s the lie that sets Georgia free, but at a cost.",
      "\u201cShe definitely manipulates him,\u201d Gentry says. \u201cIt\u2019s survival. She pulled a Georgia.\u201d",
      "Gentry explains that Ginny knew the longterm impact that lying under oath could have on her younger brother but felt she had no other choice.",
      "\u201cShe forced his hand,\u201d Gentry says. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t going to let Austin live with that man, not while their mom rotted in jail.\u201d",
      "The scene leaves lingering questions, too: Is Ginny becoming her mother? What kind of damage has already been done to Austin, who ends the season acting withdrawn and unstable?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the scary part,\u201d Gentry says. \u201c(Austin) has already changed.\u201d",

      "When asked who might be the biggest threat next season, Gentry pauses. \u201cHonestly? The danger might not come from one person,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could be Georgia herself \u2014 or even Ginny.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "By the end of Season 3 of \"Ginny & Georgia,\" Georgia Miller\u2019s carefully crafted image as a charming Southern mom has officially unraveled. Beneath the sunny smile and picture-perfect exterior is a woman who has killed three times.",
      "Not every act was cold-blooded murder, but each one left a body behind. Georgia may have walked out of court a free woman, but her secrets are no longer buried. Her past, once guarded so fiercely, is now in full view.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been calling this Georgia\u2019s breakdown season,\u201d actor Brianne Howey, who plays Georgia, tells TODAY.com. \u201cGinny had to go through it last season, and now it was Georgia\u2019s turn. Georgia has to face these consequences, and yes, as an actor, it was devastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cGeorgia got very burned this season \u2014 but I\u2019m hoping to see her rise from the ashes,\u201d she says.",
      "Here\u2019s a breakdown of the lives Georgia has taken, her motivations and how those choices may continue to unravel in future seasons.",
      "Tom Fuller (Season 2, Episode 10)",
      "Georgia\u2019s most controversial kill comes in the Season 2 finale, when she smothers Cynthia Fuller\u2019s (Sabrina Grdevich) comatose husband, Tom (Vincent Legault), with a pillow. Cynthia never asked her to \u2014 but Georgia takes it upon herself.",
      "It\u2019s framed as a mercy killing, but it also conveniently removes an obstacle in Cynthia\u2019s life \u2014 which benefits Georgia socially and emotionally.",
      "\u201cThere haven\u2019t, historically in her life, been a lot of people who have helped her, so that has so much weight to her,\u201d series creator Sarah Lampert tells TODAY.com. \u201cShe really does see killing Cynthia\u2019s husband, in her mind, as a favor. She views herself as judge, jury and executioner.\u201d",
      "Georgia feels indebted to Cynthia for helping her get rid of her abusive ex, Gil. Killing Tom is Georgia\u2019s twisted way of repaying that kindness, actor Howey says.",
      "\u201cGeorgia didn\u2019t want anybody to know what her relationship with Gil was like,\u201d Howey tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut Georgia doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. The act of kindness Cynthia offered her \u2014 by making sure Gil couldn\u2019t live in town \u2014 was paramount for Georgia. Nothing had meant more to her.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo yes, Georgia can feel morally ambiguous,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut Georgia feels that her intentions are pure. She wanted to give Cynthia the same favor Cynthia gave her \u2014 to remove the pain in her life. It\u2019s very nuanced and complicated, but I think there\u2019s a recognition between these two women about how hard it is to be a mom and a woman.\u201d",
      "Kenny Drexel (Season 1)",
      "Kenny (Darryl Scheelar), Georgia\u2019s wealthy second husband, dies under mysterious circumstances \u2014 until it\u2019s revealed Georgia had poisoned his smoothie with wolfsbane.",
      "Georgia later claims she did it to protect Ginny, after discovering Kenny had been sexually inappropriate toward her daughter. It\u2019s the first clear sign that Georgia is willing to kill for her family \u2014 and to keep control of the narrative.",
      "\u201cKenny was a bad guy,\u201d Antonia Gentry, who plays Ginny, tells TODAY.com. \u201cA lot of what happens to Ginny and Georgia happens simply because of the decisions they make. So maybe the bad guy at the end of the day is just their carelessness, their recklessness, their impulsivity.\u201d",
      "Anthony Green (Season 1, Flashback)",
      "In a flashback from years earlier, Georgia\u2019s abusive ex-husband, Anthony Green (Rodrigo Fernandez-Stoll), shows up, threatening both her and a young Ginny. Georgia shoots him, a death that\u2019s arguably self-defense.",
      "Still, she disposes of the body and never reports it. The moment shapes her view of justice: If the system won\u2019t help her, she\u2019ll take matters into her own hands.",

      "\u201cThere is no feud. I adore, I love this woman madly, and she is so important to me,\u201d he told the magazine, reportedly getting choked up and looking at Wood. \u201cThis is Goldie Hawn. This is Meg Ryan. She can do anything, and she will. You watch what the next 20 years of her experience will be. I\u2019ll be on an island, I think Greece. But she\u2019s special. There is no feud. She is love and I know that I am that to her. We care about each other very deeply.\u201d",
      "The photoshoot, done in May, was the first time they had seen each other once since the February \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d premiere event.",
      "Since the HBO show ended, a number of headlines about the drama that took place on the set have come out. Actor Jason Isaacs has made comments about the tension among the cast, saying in one interview with Vulture that there were \u201cfewer deaths and just as much drama.\u201d",
      "Goggins and Wood portrayed doomed couple Rick and Chelsea. As the series aired, people began noticing that Goggins wasn't tagging Wood on his Instagram photos.",
      "Then there came the debacle over the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d parody that poked fun at Wood\u2019s appearance. In an Instagram story, Wood called the sketch \u201cmean and unfunny,\u201d while Goggins wrote in a since-deleted comment on the official \u201cSNL\u201d Instagram post, \u201cHahahahahhahaha Amazzzingggg.\u201d",
      "When discussing this exchange, Goggins shared his thoughts about the headlines pitting them against each other.",

      "When asked about the interview for the London Times' titled \u201cWalton Goggins: Aimee Lou Wood? I\u2019m not gonna have that conversation,\u201d he explained that comments around their rumored fallout were not up for discussion.",
      "\u201cWhat am I gonna do, speak for both of us? Never,\u201d he replied, noting that he was appalled by the reporter's repeated questions and comments about Wood.",
      "Goggins also addressed unfollowing Wood on Instagram, explaining that after filming he needed to break away from his character Rick and the emotional experience of being back in Thailand. Goggins traveled to Thailand there following the 2004 death of his wife Leanne Goggins. He is now married to Nadia Conners.",

      "\u201cEarlier this year, I made the hard decision to end my marriage after deep prayer and reflection,\u201d she began. TODAY.com has obtained documents confirming that she filed for a dissolution of marriage in Florida in March.",
      "Reid continued, \u201cI hold marriage in the highest regard, so this has been one of the most painful, revealing, and challenging seasons of my life. I\u2019ve been hesitant to share until I could do so from a place of healing \u2014 not fresh, open wounds.\u201d",
      "The former model, who shares three children with the swimmer, alluded to \"trials\" that led her to make the decision to end their relationship.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve come to understand that staying isn\u2019t always the most loving decision someone can make. For me, leaving was an act of love \u2014 for those around me and for myself,\u201d she explained.",

      "She concluded by asking for prayers and support.",
      "In the caption, she included a mending heart emoji.",
      "Lochte reacted to their divorce being made public with his own statement on Instagram, suggesting the split was mutual.",
      "\u201cI want to take a moment to acknowledge what Kayla shared. This past year has brought major changes for both of us as we\u2019ve come to the difficult decision to end our marriage,\" he said. \"I\u2019m deeply grateful for the life we\u2019ve built together and especially for the love we share for our three children.\u201d",

      "The State Department said Thursday that it would freeze any assets that the ICC judges, who come from Benin, Peru, Slovenia and Uganda, have in U.S. jurisdictions. The move is just the latest step that the administration has taken to punish the ICC and its officials for investigations undertaken against Israel and the United States.",
      "\u201cAs ICC judges, these four individuals have actively engaged in the ICC\u2019s illegitimate and baseless actions targeting America or our close ally, Israel,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe ICC is politicized and falsely claims unfettered discretion to investigate, charge, and prosecute nationals of the United States and our allies,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis dangerous assertion and abuse of power infringes upon the sovereignty and national security of the United States and our allies, including Israel.\u201d",

Israel strongly denies the allegations.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump targeted the ICC with sanctions, voicing displeasure with investigations into Israel and complaints about alleged war crimes said to have been committed by U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Those sanctions were rescinded by President Joe Biden\u2019s administration in early 2021.",
      "Rubio said the U.S. would continue to take action to protect its and Israel\u2019s interests at the court. \u201cThe United States will take whatever actions we deem necessary to protect our sovereignty, that of Israel, and any other U.S. ally from illegitimate actions by the ICC,\u201d he said.",

      "But the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang \u201cheartbroken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.",
      "C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.",
      "The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.",
      "Before the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.",
      "\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.",

      "While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.",

      "Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d",
      "There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.",

      "The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.",
      "China\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.",
      "In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.",
      "China has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.",

    "story": [
      "A private lunar lander from Japan crashed while attempting a touchdown Friday, the latest casualty in the commercial rush to the moon.",
      "The Tokyo-based company ispace declared the mission a failure several hours after communication was lost with the lander. Flight controllers scrambled to gain contact, but were met with only silence and said they were concluding the mission.",
      "Communications ceased less than two minutes before the spacecraft\u2019s scheduled landing on the moon with a mini rover. Until then, the descent from lunar orbit seemed to be going well.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada apologized to everyone who contributed to the mission, the second lunar strikeout for ispace.",
      "Two years ago, the company\u2019s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name \u201cResilience\u201d for its successor lander. Resilience carried a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist\u2019s toy-size red house for placement on the moon\u2019s dusty surface.",
      "Company officials said it was too soon to know whether the same problem doomed both missions.",
      "\u201cThis is the second time that we were not able to land. So we really have to take it very seriously,\u201d Hakamada told reporters. He stressed that the company would press ahead with more lunar missions.",
      "A preliminary analysis indicates the laser system for measuring the altitude did not work as planned, and the lander descended too fast, officials said. \u201cBased on these circumstances, it is currently assumed that the lander likely performed a hard landing on the lunar surface,\u201d the company said in a written statement.",
      "Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.",
      "Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.",
      "Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and was declared dead within hours.",
      "Resilience was targeting the top of the moon, a less treacherous place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side\u2019s northern tier.",
      "Plans had called for the 7.5-foot Resilience to beam back pictures within hours and for the lander to lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface this weekend.",
      "Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace\u2019s European-built rover \u2014 named Tenacious \u2014 sported a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.",
      "The rover, weighing just 11 pounds, was going to stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch per second. It was capable of venturing up to two-thirds of a mile from the lander and should be operational throughout the two-week mission, the period of daylight.",
      "Besides science and tech experiments, there was an artistic touch.",
      "The rover held a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.",
      "Minutes before the attempted landing, Hakamada assured everyone that ispace had learned from its first failed mission. \u201cEngineers did everything they possibly could\u201d to ensure success this time, he said.",
      "He considered the latest moonshot \u201cmerely a steppingstone\u201d to its bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement.",
      "Ispace, like other businesses, does not have \u201cinfinite funds\u201d and cannot afford repeated failures, Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month.",
      "While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it\u2019s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.",
      "Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year\u2019s end: Jeff Bezos\u2018 Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic\u2019s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere."

      "In a Truth Social post just before 11 a.m., Trump said the call lasted about 90 minutes but provided few details about it other than that it focused on trade. He said a meeting will now be held \"shortly\" between representatives from the two countries at a location to be determined.",

      "The current tariff level on Chinese imports brought into the U.S. is at least 30%. That's down from the 145% punitive level Trump had imposed until a handshake agreement in Geneva last month led to a mutual stand-down that also saw China reduce its duties on U.S. imports down to 10% from 125%.",
      "But tensions heated up again Friday after Trump accused China of violating the Geneva understanding, though without adding many specifics. That prompted China to level a similar accusation against Trump on Monday.",
      "A China spokesperson said Xi emphasized on the call that his country has \u201cearnestly implemented\u201d the Geneva agreement and that the U.S. should \u201crevoke its negative measures against China.\u201d",
      "Trump remains fixated on closing America's trade deficit with China, which is the difference between how much the U.S. imports from China versus how much it exports. On Thursday, fresh data showed the gap dropped sharply in April \u2014 with the deficit with China declining to $19.7 billion, the lowest level since March 2020.",
      "\"The sharp narrowing in the April U.S. international trade deficit tells us the temporary first-quarter splurge by businesses pulling-forward demand to get ahead of tariffs has run its course,\" Wells Fargo economists wrote in a note after the data was released.",

      "Trump has pledged that his unprecedented tariffs gambit will lead to trade deals \u2014\u00a0but despite a flurry of promises and pronouncements that they are near, no firm deals have materialized. Even the agreement with the U.K. announced last month from the Oval Office has been described as merely a \"political pact\" rather than a formalized, mutually beneficial trade agreement.",
      "It's led to growing critiques that Trump's tariffs strategy has little to show so far besides scrambling the investment and hiring plans of businesses the world over.",
      "Trump faces a particularly complex set of issues with China. Alongside trade, he is also attempting to wrestle TikTok away from Chinese ownership, while seeking to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl that authorities say largely originates from Chinese manufacturers.",
      "While there are signs of slowing fentanyl seizures at the U.S. -Mexico border, there has been no sign of progress on the TikTok talks. A deadline that would force TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the popular social media app or face a U.S. ban is set to expire June 19. Trump now faces the prospect of having to extend the deadline for a third time."

      "China wants to stop the EV price war. Can it?",
      "The global economy faces many headwinds, but the aviation industry is expected to defy them",
      "DAUs is a measure of the number of people who visit or interact with a platform every 24 hours. Monthly active users (MAUs), a measure of user engagement over a 30-day period, was also down at Temu (30%) and Shein (12%) in May versus March.",
      "The declines were also reflected in both platforms\u2019 Apple App Store rankings. Temu averaged a rank of 132 in May 2025, down from an average top 3 ranking a year ago, while Shein averaged a rank of 60 last month versus a top 10 ranking the year prior, the data showed.",
      "Neither Temu nor Shein immediately responded to CNBC\u2019s request for comment.",
      "The user dropoff comes as both Temu and Shein have pulled back on U.S. advertising spend over recent months since the Trump administration\u2019s tariff announcements.",
      "Trump in April announced sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports, including the end of the \u201cde minimis\u201d tariff exemption on May 2, which allowed companies to ship low-cost goods worth less than $800 to the U.S. tariff-free.",
      "In May, Temu\u2019s U.S. ad spend fell 95% year-on-year while Shein\u2019s was down 70%.",
      "\u201cTemu and Shein\u2019s decline in U.S. ad spend was also noticeable in April, as spend decreased by 40% and 65% YoY, respectively,\u201d Seema Shah, vice president of research and insights at Sensor Tower, said in emailed comments to CNBC.",
      "Both Temu and Shein also altered their logistics models in the wake of tariffs, shifting away from a drop shipping model, which allowed them to send items directly from Chinese suppliers to U.S. consumers, and instead, particularly in Temu\u2019s case, building up a network of U.S. warehouses.",
      "Rui Ma, founder and analyst at Tech Buzz China, said such moves were also likely to have impacted the companies\u2019 ad spend strategy and customer acquisition patterns.",
      "\u201cAll these additional costs and regulatory hurdles are clearly hurting Chinese platforms\u2019 U.S. growth prospects,\u201d she wrote in emailed comments.",
      "Tech Buzz China research from March showed that a 50% tariff would be the point at which Temu would lose most of its price advantages and find it difficult to operate. The tariff on former de minimis imports currently stands at 54%, having been lowered from 120% amid a 90-day tariff truce between the U.S. and China.",
      "Growth outside the U.S.",
      "Last week, Temu\u2019s parent company PDD Holdings reported first-quarter earnings below estimates and pointed to tariffs as a significant pressure on sellers.",
      "Temu\u2019s popularity has nevertheless picked up outside the U.S., with non-U.S. users rising to account for 90% of the platform\u2019s 405 million global MAUs in the second quarter, according to HSBC.",
      "Writing in a note last week, HSBC analysts said that was \u201csupported by growth in Europe, Latin America, and South America.\u201d They added that the swiftest of that growth occurred in \u201cless affluent markets.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany (Chinese platforms) are now actively redirecting their efforts toward other markets such as Europe,\u201d Ma said."

      "The Israeli military and Shin Bet, Israel's domestic security agency, recovered the bodies of Weinstein-Haggai, 70, and Haggai, 72, in a special operation, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement Thursday morning.",
      "The couple, from kibbutz Nir Oz, were killed during the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks, in which around 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.",
      "Since then, more than 54,000 people, including thousands of children, have been killed in Gaza during Israel's ensuing military offensive, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry there.",
      "The Israeli military and Shin Bet said in a joint statement Thursday that Weinstein-Haggai and Haggai were killed and taken into Gaza by members of the Mujahideen Brigades, the armed wing of the Palestinian Mujahideen Movement.",
      "It said its operation was made possible by precise intelligence from Israeli authorities, and added that the loved ones of the couple and community of Nir Oz had been notified of the recovery of the couple's bodies.",
      "The status of Weinstein-Haggai and Haggai had initially been unclear in the aftermath of the attacks, but then-President Joe Biden said in December 2023 that Weinstein-Haggai was found to have been killed Oct. 7, along with Haggai.",

    "story": [
      "Three M\u0101ori lawmakers in New Zealand received record suspensions of up to three weeks Thursday over a protest haka they performed against a contentious bill in Parliament last year.",
      "The lawmakers drew global attention in November when they performed the haka, a ceremonial chanting dance of defiance that is a cherished cultural symbol of New Zealand. They were protesting legislation that would have reinterpreted the country\u2019s 184-year-old founding document, a treaty that was signed between colonial British rulers and Indigenous M\u0101ori.",
      "A parliamentary committee found the three lawmakers in contempt of parliament last month and recommended that they be suspended for up to three weeks \u201cfor acting in a manner that could have the effect of intimidating a member of the House.\u201d",
      "Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi, co-leaders of Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori party, which holds six of Parliament\u2019s 123 seats, were suspended for three weeks each.",
      "Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, who at 22 is New Zealand\u2019s youngest legislator, was suspended for one week on the recommendation of the committee, which said in its report that she had demonstrated \u201csome level of contrition\u201d in her written statement.",
      "The votes were 68-55 against Maipi-Clarke, 68-54 against Ngarewa-Packer and 68-53 against Waititi, all of whom were suspended immediately.",
      "Waititi told reporters after the votes that he and his colleagues would \u201ccontinue to be the voices our people expect us to be.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are demonizing haka,\u201d he said of the lawmakers who voted for the suspensions. \u201cThey are making us out to be violent, to be disruptive, and our people have heard that for a long, long time.\u201d",
      "It is rare for New Zealand lawmakers to receive such suspensions, which are unpaid. The longest anyone had previously been suspended was three days.",
      "The opposition Labour Party, as well as the Green Party, criticized the suspensions as disproportionate, with the Labour Party proposing censure instead.",
      "The three lawmakers performed the protest haka in November during the reading of a bill that would have redefined the Treaty of Waitangi. Signed in 1840 between the British crown and M\u0101ori chiefs, the treaty established British governance and structures to protect M\u0101ori rights, and it continues to influence policy today.",
      "The legislation was brought by the small libertarian party ACT New Zealand, which said the treaty had been misinterpreted to give M\u0101ori people special treatment.",
      "Critics of the bill, which was defeated in April, said it would undo decades of progress for M\u0101ori, who make up about 20% of New Zealand\u2019s 5 million people and fare worse than the rest of the population in health, education and the criminal justice system.",
      "One of the M\u0101ori lawmakers, Maipi-Clarke, led the haka by tearing up a copy of the bill, joined by other M\u0101ori members and some visitors in the public gallery. Video of the protest went viral and gathered hundreds of millions of views across social media.",
      "Some lawmakers objected to the way their M\u0101ori colleagues advanced toward them across the floor.",
      "\u201cThis was a very serious incident, the likes of which I have never seen before in my 23 years in the debating chamber,\u201d said Judith Collins of the center-right National Party, chair of the parliamentary committee that issued the report.",
      "She added that the lawmakers performed the haka without permission and that the disruption suspended legislative proceedings for 30 minutes.",
      "The three M\u0101ori lawmakers declined to appear before the committee during its investigation, citing disrespect for their cultural traditions. Their party said that the way it was being conducted was \u201cgrossly unjust\u201d and that \u201cthis was not about process, this became personal.\u201d",
      "The committee said the lawmakers were being sanctioned not for performing the haka but for \u201cthe time at and manner in which it was performed.\u201d It said the severity of the sanctions was intended to \u201cleave members in no doubt that the behavior discussed is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "The votes had originally been scheduled for last month but were postponed so the three M\u0101ori lawmakers could participate in debate over the federal budget.",
      "Performing the haka in Parliament is not uncommon, and it is typically seen when M\u0101ori members celebrate the passage of a particular bill. The dance is known abroad for being performed at matches by New Zealand\u2019s rugby teams, and variations of it are also performed at funerals and formal welcomes.",
      "\u201cIt would have been clearly understood by everyone in the Parliament that this was a peaceful act of protest done in a way that aligns with M\u0101ori tradition,\u201d said Julian Rawiri Kusabs, a M\u0101ori historian and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.",
      "Kusabs said the suspension was a setback in decades of reconciliation efforts between the New Zealand government and M\u0101ori communities, whose members have had to navigate \u201ca highly complex and frequently painful relationship\u201d even to achieve representation in Parliament.",
      "The suspension, he said, reinforces the long-standing perception that \u201cM\u0101ori culture is not equally respected within New Zealand\u2019s formal institutions of governance.\u201d"
