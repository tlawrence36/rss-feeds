    "story": [
      "An attorney defending Jay-Z against a rape allegation says the unnamed accuser's account is \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- An attorney defending Jay-Z against the rape allegation brought against him last week by an unnamed woman outlined a range of evidence Monday that he said showed the accuser\u2019s account to be \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "The woman told NBC News last week that Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sexually assaulted her in 2000, when she was 13, at an after-party for the MTV Music Awards. She has since acknowledged certain inconsistencies in her story.",
      "Speaking to reporters at Roc Nation\u2019s New York headquarters, Jay-Z\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, said the woman\u2019s claim relied on an \u201cimpossible timeline\u201d and a nonexistent location. While the lawsuit said the assault happened at a \u201clarge white residence with a U-shaped driveway,\u201d photos show both Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, and Combs at a nightclub following the award show.",
      "In the suit, the woman said she snuck out of a window of her home in Rochester and hitched a ride to the award ceremony from a friend, who has since died. She said she watched the event on a jumbotron outside, then befriended a limousine driver who drove her to the house party where she was assaulted by the two rap moguls.",
      "Following the alleged rape, she said she fled the house and called her father for a ride home from a nearby gas station.",
      "The allegation, Spiro said, \u201cdefies credibility.\u201d It would\u2019ve taken her five hours to drive from Rochester, the lawyer noted, meaning she would\u2019ve had to leave her home by 3 p.m. Permits and photographs show there was no jumbotron outside the VMAs in 2000, according to Spiro. The woman\u2019s father has said he does not recall driving from Rochester to pick her up in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just that this story is a lie and that it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s provably, demonstrably false,\u201d Spiro said. \"This never happened.\u201d",
      "The suit comes amid a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs, who remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in May.",
      "The lawsuits were filed on the eve of the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a New York law permitting victims of sexual abuse a one-year window to file civil action regardless of the statute of limitations.",
      "After initially suing Combs, the woman\u2019s complaint was amended to include a new allegation that Jay-Z also participated in the sexual assault as a third unnamed celebrity watched.",
      "The litigation was filed by Tony Buzbee, a personal injury attorney in Houston whose firm has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers. In October, Buzbee said he was representing some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Last month, Jay-Z anonymously sued Buzbee, alleging the lawyer had attempted to blackmail him by making the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Buzbee has said the letter was simply trying to set up a confidential mediation session.",
      "In a statement last week, Jay-Z said his \u201cheart and support goes out to true victims in the world.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Spiro accused Buzbee of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the woman, while \"destroying this opportunity and the voices of real victims.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement Monday, Buzbee said the woman had been referred to him by another law firm and vetted by four attorneys from his firm.",
      "\u201cCourts exist to resolve factual disputes,\u201d Buzbee added. \u201cOur client remains adamant about her claim.\u201d"

      "Former talk show host Carlos Watson has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in the federal financial conspiracy case surrounding his once-buzzy Ozy Media",
      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax.",
      "There's no parallel between faking blood test results and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "Only one of those investors spoke at the sentencing \u2014 Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "\u201dThe Rivals\u201d is Jane Pek\u2019s latest mystery novel featuring the online dating detective Claudia Lin",
      "Claudia Lin, an online dating detective in the age of AI, is hunting once again through a dark cybersphere of tech systems in \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d the second novel in a new mystery series by Jane Pek.",
      "Pek, who introduced Claudia in her 2022 debut book, \u201cThe Verifiers,\u201d has given the mystery genre fresh trappings \u2014 a vivid New York City landscape of chatbots and apps that can create chaos or sniff out fraud, and a delightfully plucky new sleuth, who is in her mid-20s, Asian American and gay.",
      "In \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d Claudia and Becks Rittel are the co-owners of the fact-checking firm Veracity. It\u2019s a tiny business \u2014 it only has one other employee, the unkempt gamer Squirrel \u2014 but helps clients of giant matchmaking platforms make sure the strangers they meet for dates are not unscrupulous liars or worse.",
      "\u201cThe Rivals\u201d opens with a couple of customers from online meet-up sites seeking different kinds of assistance. One wants Veracity to make sure his new lady friend, the charming Amalia Suarez, is all she claims to be; the other, Pradeep Mehta, anxiously asks for help taking down a false online gay-dating profile that could ruin his life.",
      "Claudia takes on both projects, despite Becks\u2019 protests and disparagement. A curt, tough-minded colleague in her mid-30s, Becks is nicknamed the \u201cBlonde Assassin.\u201d In short order, both cases present Claudia with false turns, odd developments and scary possibilities. These twists make \u201cThe Rivals\u201d a modern mystery unfolding amid synthetic culprits \u2014 cyberworld bots known as \u201csynths\u201d \u2014 that can wreck real lives.",
      "Pek adds a few vital human ingredients to the story\u2019s digital mix. One is Claudia\u2019s striving but dysfunctional family. Her siblings, Charles and Coraline, and their irritable mother are introduced in an early chapter as they gather in the West Village for a meal celebrating the Chinese New Year. Coraline\u2019s beau is there, too. Their father is out of the picture. A celebration the meal is not, but the Lin family fracas adds sparks to the narrative throughout.",
      "Pek also makes neighborhoods and go-to sites of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other city environs an integral and appealing part of the story. Claudia, for example, plays Ultimate frisbee in Prospect Park and takes the reader on her many rendezvous, from the touristy High Line to a bike path through Fort Washington Park.",
      "Claudia\u2019s sexuality is not a central tug-of-war plot issue. But it does give an edgy lift to the story line when Claudia, as the novel\u2019s narrator, notes the inner romantic tingles set off in her by others.",
      "Pek writes with wit and AI savvy. At times \u201cThe Rivals\u201d unfolds with so much tech-heavy dialogue that it can be hard to follow. But Claudia is a winning new entry in the field of modern serial detectives. \u201cThe Rivals\u201d hints that she has more work in store. With the freshness of Pek\u2019s staging of online love and death, a third entry in the series will be welcome.",

      "NEW YORK -- Come and take a trip to the giddy birth of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll through the eyes of one of its pioneers \u2014 Brenda Lee.",
      "The \u201cI'm Sorry\u201d and \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d hitmaker who shared stages with both Elvis Presley and the Beatles is a guide to those heady years in \u201cAmerican Masters \u2014 Brenda Lee: Rockin\u2019 Around,\u201d which premieres Monday on PBS.",
      "\u201cThat era can never be repeated again,\u201d she tells The Associated Press on the eve of the broadcast. \u201cThat was an era when the money wasn\u2019t thought about, the fame wasn\u2019t thought about. I know that sounds crazy, but it is true. The artists of that time were there to do their thing, and they loved it, whether they got paid or not.\u201d",
      "Lee, 80, had her first hit record in 1960 at age 15 and went on to sell more than 100 million albums. In the \u201960s, she earned more Hot 100 singles in the United States \u2014 46 \u2014 than any recording artist besides the Beatles, Presley or Ray Charles. She won a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2009.",
      "She is the rare artist inducted into both the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, moving effortlessly in her career between country, pop, rock and rockabilly sounds.",
      "\u201cI never classified myself as a ballad singer, as a rock singer, as a country singer or anything. I just wanted to sing,\u201d she says in the interview. \u201cSome artists can sing it all. Not me. I have to love what I\u2019m singing or it\u2019s not believable.\u201d",
      "The documentary draws on the commentary of musicologists and such stars as Keith Urban, Tanya Tucker, Trisha Yearwood, Jackie DeShannon, Pat Benatar and Neil Giraldo.",
      "\u201cI had no trouble getting people to talk about Brenda and why she matters and why we should look to her,\u201d says director Barbara Hall. \u201cThis is what\u2019s possible when you just get your head down and stay focused and do what you know you\u2019re good at and don\u2019t give up.\u201d",
      "Lee was the daughter of a carpenter in Atlanta who died in a construction accident when she was just 8. Her mother soon was forced to work in the cotton mill. When she was 10, country music singer Red Foley put her on his national TV program \u201cOzark Jubilee.\u201d By age 12, she had appeared on various network TV variety shows.",
      "The portrait that emerges is a rare one for the music industry, the story of a young woman who is protected and nurtured. Lee credits producer Owen Bradley; her manager, Dub Allbritten; and the musicians she worked with for looking out for her, treating her like a little sister.",
      "\u201cI hear horror stories about children in show business, but I certainly didn\u2019t have that experience, and I\u2019m grateful for that,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt was like I was one of the group, and that was so important to me.\u201d",
      "The holidays are when Lee shines most, with her hit \u201cRockin\u2019 Around the Christmas Tree\u201d in high rotation. In 2023, it topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart for the first time ever, 65 years after the song\u2019s debut.",
      "\u201cShe is in your house every Christmas,\u201d says Hall. \u201cShe is a part of something that so many Americans celebrate. So, I\u2019m hoping that people will embrace her story and her music once they get reintroduced to it.\u201d",
      "She recorded it at age 13 in July 1958, not exactly a snowy time in the South. The air conditioner was cranked up in the recording studio and there was a Christmas tree set up to get everyone in the mood. It initially was a bigger hit abroad and later got a boost in the 1990 film \u201cHome Alone.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou get a wonderful song and it may lay around for a few years like \u2018Rockin\u2019\u2019 did, but if it\u2019s as wonderful as \u2019Rockin\u2033 was, it\u2019ll show its head sooner or later, and that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Lee says.",
      "Hall, who worked on a 2017 \u201cAmerican Masters\u201d documentary on Patsy Cline, says she tried to find any dirt on Lee and simply couldn't. Even when Lee broke her leg during the shoot and had to be hospitalized, she was gracious and kind.",
      "\u201cIf my leg was broken in 10 places and I had to be in a rehab facility, I\u2019d probably be in a bad mood the whole time,\" she says. \"She was cracking jokes and everyone in the room felt like she was their friend.\u201d"

      "\u201cDay of the Fight\u201d culminates in the Madison Square Garden match, but the movie is largely about the preamble to the fight. The movie follows Flannigan on a series of poignant errands.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film where you didn\u2019t necessarily need the boxing match,\u201d Huston says. \u201cThe boxing match became icing.\u201d",
      "The film instead evolves as an elegiac character study of a man, pummeled by life, trying to put things in order.",
      "\u201cMe and Michael used to speak about how you can walk into any boxing gyms and you\u2019d find multiple stories just like Irish Mike\u2019s,\u201d says Huston. \u201cThese guys go through it. I think that\u2019s probably why their world is so fascinating to us.\u201d",
      "CORNERMAN: Ron Perlman. Though \u201cDay of the Fight\u201d is graced by a several father figures (Joe Pesci, Steve Buscemi), the one that really stands out is Perlman\u2019s coach. Perlman, the spectacular character actor, has all the gravitas and crustiness you\u2019d ever want in a boxing coach.",
      "William Goldenberg, the Oscar-winning editor (\u201cArgo,\u201d \u201cHeat\u201d) directs this based-on-a-true-story drama about the life of NCAA champion wrestler Anthony Robles, played by Jharrel Jerome. The film, which arrives Jan. 16 on Prime Video, chronicles Robles\u2019 constant hardships, not the least of which is that he was born without his right leg.",
      "While \u201cUnstoppable\u201d does steer toward the moment of ultimate triumph for Robles, it carefully and naturally dramatizes his long road to the championship. It\u2019s less about Robles\u2019 overcoming one challenge than it is about his perseverance through constant adversary. Jennifer Lopez co-stars as his mother, with Bobby Cannavale as an abusive step father.",
      "\u201cAt a certain point, it\u2019s a movie about an athlete who wins, so there\u2019s going to be certain tropes that are unavoidable. And I didn\u2019t want to avoid them,\u201d says Goldenberg. \u201cI just wanted to try to do them in an organic, real-feeling way. Shooting handheld was the idea that we\u2019re with him along the journey, so you feel like you were facing the challenges he faces.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a constant battle,\u201d says Robles. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of how I felt going through my life, whether it was on a mat against a flesh and blood opponent or it was in my family life or the world. There was always something I was fighting against.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnstoppable\u201d is unique for another reason. While Jerome, the charismatic up-and-coming actor of \u201cMoonlight,\" bulked up for the role and devoted himself to shadowing Robles, he couldn\u2019t do everything that Robles could. For the wrestling scenes, Robles was Jerome\u2019s body double.",
      "\u201cI signed on to the movie and then I was like: How am I going to do the wrestling?\u201d says Goldenberg. \u201cI watched so many hours of him wrestling. I thought, there\u2019s no way I can do this without him doubling himself. He moves in a way that I just thought no one could ever master.\u201d",
      "CORNERMAN: \u201cUnstoppable\u201d is the rare sports drama to give you not just one excellent coach, but two. Because it spans Robles\u2019 wrestling career in high school and college, we first get Michael Pe\u00f1a as his most devoted supporter, and, later, Don Cheadle as his initially more skeptical coach in college.",
      "\u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d directed by decorated cinematographer Rachel Morrison (\u201cFruitvale Station,\u201d \u201cMudbound\u201d), is also about a real champion, the Olympic gold medal winner Claressa Shields (played by Destiny Ryan).",
      "The first half of \u201cThe Fire Inside,\u201d which opens Dec. 25, is somewhat conventional, albeit crafted with a keen sense of texture and the local flavor of Flint, Michigan, where Shields was from. It charts her rise as a female boxer leading up to the 2012 Olympics. Once she's won gold, you might even glance at your watch and wonder why they wrapped things up so quickly.",
      "But the film, scripted by Barry Jenkins, the \u201cMoonlight\u201d director, then turns into something else, something more interesting. Shields\u2019 glory is short-lived. No Wheaties box covers come for her. A tough Black woman in a bloody sport who makes no apologies for her interest in knocking out her opponent, is unappealing to marketers. As \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d continues in its thought-provoking third act, it asks questions less about who wins and more about who gets to be deemed \u201can American hero.\u201d",
      "CORNERMAN: Brian Tyree Henry plays Shields\u2019 devoted cornerman Jason Crutchfield for the duration, from her first jabs in the gym to her post-Olympics struggles. Henry, a tender and soulful actor in everything, is more of a co-star than a supporting player. Of all the coaches in these three films, he\u2019s the one you\u2019d most want cheering you on."

      "While a lot of theater companies are dusting off traditional chestnuts like \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d or \"White Christmas,\u201d some are tackling the TV Christmas rom-com. Almost like a plot from Hallmark's playbook, regional and community theaters are putting on a festive show. But these are gentle send-ups of the films and all their cheesy spirit.",
      "Love \u2018em or hate \u2019em, formulaic meet-cute holiday flicks have become as tied to the yuletide as ugly sweaters and hot chocolate. Theater directors say the movies have a universal appeal since most audiences can recognize the story beats. And judging by the high ticket sales, these parodies are gaining a holly jolly reception.",
      "Ghostlight Theatre, a community theater in the Phoenix suburb of Sun City West, is presenting \"The Holiday Channel Christmas Movie Wonderthon,\u201d by Don Zolidis. The story juggles six different would-be couples at the same Vermont inn.",
      "They all represent archetypes, from the movie star seeking anonymity to a Christmas-themed shop proprietor. All the female characters have holiday-ish names like Holly, Joy and Carol. In one funny twist, real-life husband and wife Michael and GinaKay Howell play one of the couples. She says the experience has been \u201cthe greatest Christmas present.\u201d Their courtship banter, however, was nothing like in the play.",

What are we even saying?\u2019\u201d laughed Michael, who plays the prince of a fictitious country with a \u201cBorat\u201d-like accent. \u201cIt really hit the nail on the head of everything that Hallmark stands for and then, like, makes fun of it.\"",
      "Zach Athanasakis, the director, emphasized to the 16-member cast that much of the humor depends on them saying their lines with a straight face.",
      "\u201cA lot of these lines are very, very corny and you have to be able to say it with your chest and really, truly embody how much weight that holds for the character in it \u2014 no matter how silly it is,\u201d Athanasakis said.",
      "Laura Vines, Ghostlight's executive director and co-founder, had been looking for something \u201cthat would kind of set us apart\u201d in metro Phoenix. She read in a Facebook group that another community theater had found a hit in \u201cWonderthon.\u201d Economically, the show doesn't break the bank to stage.",
      "\u201cIt actually in the script calls for everybody to just wear red and green sweaters. We're doing something a little bit different, but it's kind of along those lines,\u201d Vines said.",
      "The day before Thanksgiving, Broadway Rose Theatre Company in Tigard, Oregon, unwrapped \u201cFive Golden Rings: A Greeting Card Channel Holiday Musical.\u201d This show also takes place in a Vermont bed-and-breakfast with a protagonist named Holly. She's a business executive who falls for the \u201chunky lumberjack widower\u201d owner of the B&B, said the director, Dan Murphy.",
      "The regional theater, which employs 250 people, has built a reputation for choosing shows \u201coff the beaten path,\" says Murphy, a founding member. He really felt good about the choice when he saw the reactions across age groups.",
      "\u201cThis last weekend we had a group of donors come in and watch rehearsals and they were laughing at some of the jokes,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe crew, they are interns from high school seniors to college. They come in and watch a rehearsal. They were laughing hysterically.\"",
      "At both theaters, most performances for the Hallmark spoofs have sold out.",

      "\u201cIt might scare some theaters. For us doing this, it\u2019s a risk that we\u2019re taking that\u2019s totally paying off,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "The Williamston Theatre in Williamston, Michigan, is reviving an original play by John Lepard, a founding member of the company, who binged 15 Hallmark Christmas movies, taking notes, and then sat down to write \u201cA Very Williamston Christmas\u201d in 2022.",
      "\u201cThe reason I wrote this is because my wife found something on YouTube, like a three-minute spoof,\" Lepard said. \"She said, \u2018You should write something like this for the theater.\u2019\u201d",
      "It took him about a month to knock out a script. He used the nom de plume Robert Hawlmark, thus making it a \u201cHawlmark original.\u201d The play is a love letter to Williamston, which has a population just over 3,800. The corporate career gal comes home from the big city of Lansing, the state capital 20 miles (32 kilometers) to the north.",
      "\u201cA lot of people said seeing our town get to be in a Hallmark movie was really fun,\u201d said Lepard, who is directing.",
      "But the play's appeal isn't limited to Williamston. Lepard has gotten requests to license it to theaters elsewhere in Michigan, and in Texas and Colorado. They could rejigger it like a Mad Libs game, he said, and \u201cjust plug in your town, your local antique store and all the things local to your place.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt makes sense to us that it\u2019s leapt off the screen and onto the stage,\" Samantha DiPippo, senior vice president of programming, said in a statement. In the plays, she said, \"people are finding fun ways to emulate our signature messages of hope, love, humor, and meaningful connection in their own communities.\u201d",
      "The send-ups gently jab at the movies \u2014 not the movie-watchers, Athanasakis made clear. Both those who relish and those who roll their eyes at Hallmark Christmas fodder will have a good laugh.",

      "When Donald Trump takes office as president for a second time, many journalists anticipate a hostile climate toward them and their work",
      "NEW YORK -- For the press heading into a second Trump administration, there's a balancing act between being prepared and being fearful.",
      "The return to power of Donald Trump, who has called journalists enemies and talked about retribution against those he feels have wronged him, has news executives nervous. Perceived threats are numerous: lawsuits of every sort, efforts to unmask anonymous sources, physical danger and intimidation, attacks on public media and libel protections, day-to-day demonization.",
      "In a closely-watched case settled over the weekend, ABC chose to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by the president-elect over an inaccurate statement made by George Stephanopoulos by agreeing to pay $15 million toward Trump\u2019s presidential library.",
      "\u201cThe news media is heading into this next administration with its eyes open,\u201d said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press.",
      "\u201cSome challenges to the free press may be overt, some may be more subtle,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to be prepared for rapid response as well as long campaigns to protect our rights \u2014 and to remember that our most important audiences are the courts and the public.\u201d",
      "One prominent editor warned against going on war footing with an administration that hasn't taken office yet. \u201cThere may be a moment to cry wolf here,\u201d said Stephen Engelberg, editor-in-chief of the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached it.\u201d",
      "At a news conference on Monday, Trump said that \u201cwe need a fair media\u201d and discussed some potential and ongoing legal cases he has against news outlets.",
      "\u201cWe have to straighten out the press,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur press is very corrupt, almost as corrupt as our elections.\u201d",
      "News organizations are heading into the second Trump era weak both financially and in public esteem. To a large extent, Trump sidestepped legacy media outlets during his campaign in favor of podcasters, yet still had time for specific beefs against ABC, CBS and NBC.",
      "The Trump team knows that many of its followers despise a probing press, and stoking that fury has political advantages. Two examples in the campaign to install Trump nominee Pete Hegseth as defense secretary shows how routine reporting activities can be characterized as an attack.",
      "When The New York Times was tipped to an email that Hegseth's mother once sent to him criticizing his treatment of women, it called her for comment. Penelope Hegseth later told Fox News that she perceived that as a threat, even though it enabled the newspaper to report that she had quickly apologized for sending the email and says she doesn't feel that way about him now.",
      "Pete Hegseth also used social media to say that ProPublica \u2014 he called it a \u201cLeft Wing hack group\u201d \u2014 was about to knowingly publish a false report that he hadn't been accepted into West Point decades ago. The news site had contacted him after officials at the military academy contradicted Hegseth's claim of acceptance. Hegseth provided proof that those officials were mistaken, and ProPublica never published a story.",
      "\u201cThat's journalism,\u201d noted ProPublica's Jesse Eisinger. But a narrative had taken hold: \u201cProPublica's botched Pete Hegseth smear,\u201d the New York Post called it in a headline.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump sued CBS News for the way it edited an interview with opponent Kamala Harris; suggested ABC News lose its broadcast license for fact-checking him during his lone debate with Harris; and successfully called for equal time on NBC after Harris appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d In the Stephanopoulos lawsuit, the ABC anchor said Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d in writer E. Jean Carroll's civil trial, when he had not.",
      "At his news conference, Trump said he was expecting to file a lawsuit against the Des Moines Register in Iowa for publishing results of a poll shortly before the election that suddenly had him behind Harris. He said that amounted to \u201cfraud and election interference.\u201d He eventually won the state handily. Spokeswoman Lark-Marie Anton says the Register stands by its reporting and believes a lawsuit would be without merit.",
      "Trump engages with the mainstream media \u2014 besides the news conference Monday he gave a newsmaking interview to NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this month \u2014 but journalists have to be alert to how their work will be portrayed.",
      "Trump's appointments, and what they've said about journalists, have raised alarms.",
      "Kash Patel, Trump's choice to lead the FBI, said on a podcast last year that \u201cwe're going to come after people in the media who lied about American citizens.\u201d Two appointees who have expressed hostility toward the media will be in a position to impact the work of journalists: Brendan Carr as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and Kari Lake as director of Voice of America.",
      "News organizations are worried that a Justice Department policy that has generally prohibited prosecutors from seizing the records of journalists in order to investigate leaks will be reversed, and are already urging journalists to protect their work. \u201cIf you have something you don't want to share with a broader audience, don't put it on the cloud,\u201d ProPublica's Engelberg said.",
      "During the first Trump administration, some journalists who covered immigration issues were pulled aside for screening and questioning. The Reporter's Committee wonders if this might happen again \u2014 and whether similar practices might extend toward reporting on expected deportations.",
      "The literary and human rights organization PEN America is concerned about journalists facing physical danger and digital hostility. It may have seemed like a flippant remark to some of his supporters when Trump, months after an attempt on his life, said at a rally that he wouldn't mind if somebody had to \u201cshoot through the fake news\u201d to get to him. But it wasn't for people standing on media risers.",
      "\u201cIt's important that the president act with responsibility to reduce physical violence against the press rather than encourage it,\u201d said Viktorya Vilk, PEN America's program director for digital safety and free expression.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana recently introduced a bill that would end taxpayer funding for public radio and television, a longtime goal of many Republicans that may get momentum with the party back in power. Some U.S. Supreme Court justices are eager to revisit a legal precedent that has made it difficult to prove defamation against news organizations.",
      "It's apparent that the new administration will come after the press in every conceivable way, former Washington Post editor Martin Baron said recently on NPR. \u201cI do think he will use every tool in his toolbox,\u201d Baron said, \u201cand there are a lot of tools.\u201d",
      "In their most pessimistic moments, advocates for the press look at what has happened in Hungary under the control of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Since Orban took control in 2010, he and his supporters have taken control of most media and turned it into a propaganda arm.",
      "Don't think that can't happen in the United States, warns Andras Petho, an investigative journalist in Hungary who left a news website when it was pressured to stifle his work, and started the investigative journalism center Direkt36.",
      "Despite repression, there is still a market for independent journalism in Hungary, he said. Earlier this year, two Hungarian officials resigned following an outcry when it was revealed that they had pardoned a man who had forced children to retract sexual abuse claims made against the director of a government-run facility.",
      "Petho said it is important for journalists not to portray themselves as any sort of resistance, because that makes it easier for the government to dismiss them. Instead, they should just do the work.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we all have to accept and admit that our power as media has declined,\u201d said Petho, who participated in the Nieman fellowship for journalists at Harvard University. \u201cOur stories don't have the same impact that they had a decade ago. But I wouldn't underestimate the power of the news media, either.\u201d",

      "Popeye the Sailor and the Belgian boy reporter Tintin lead the class of characters and works of art becoming public domain in 2025",
      "Popeye can punch without permission and Tintin can roam freely starting in 2025. The two classic comic characters who first appeared in 1929 are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the United States on Jan. 1. That means they can be used and repurposed without permission or payment to copyright holders.",
      "This year\u2019s crop of newly public artistic creations lacks the landmark vibes of last year\u2019s entrance of Mickey Mouse into the public domain. But they include a deep well of canonical works whose 95-year copyright maximums will expire. And the Disney icon's public domain presence expands.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a trove! There are a dozen new Mickey cartoons \u2014 he speaks for the first time and dons the familiar white gloves,\u201d said Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke\u2019s Center for the Study of the Public Domain. \u201cThere are masterpieces from Faulkner and Hemingway, the first sound films from Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and John Ford, and amazing music from Fats Waller, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. Pretty exciting!\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at this year\u2019s crop.",
      "Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E.C. Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip \u201cThimble Theater\u201d in 1929, speaking his first words, \u201c\u2019Ja think I\u2019m a cowboy?\u201d when asked if he was a sailor. What was supposed to be a one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed \u201dPopeye.\u201d",
      "But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength was not there from the start, and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn\u2019t begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does director Robert Altman\u2019s 1980 film, starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.",
      "That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cAdventures of Tintin\u201d in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herg\u00e9, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.",
      "The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and became a weekly feature.",
      "The comic also first appeared in the U.S. in 1929. Its signature bright colors \u2014 including Tintin\u2019s red hair \u2014 didn\u2019t appear until years later, and could, like Popeye\u2019s spinach, be the subject of legal disputes.",
      "And in much of the world, Tintin won\u2019t become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.",
      "The books becoming public this year read like the syllabus for an American literature seminar.",
      "\u201cThe Sound and the Fury,\u201d arguably William Faulkner\u2019s quintessential novel with its modernist stream-of-consciousness style, was a sensation after its publication despite being famously difficult for readers. It uses multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family\u2019s ruin in the author\u2019s native Mississippi, and would help lead to Faulkner\u2019s Nobel Prize.",
      "And Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cA Farewell to Arms\u201d joins his earlier \u201cThe Sun Also Rises\u201d in the public domain. The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during the First World War cemented Hemingway\u2019s status in the American literary canon. It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.",
      "John Steinbeck\u2019s first novel, \u201cA Cup of Gold,\u201d from 1929, will also enter the public domain.",
      "The British novelist Virginia Woolf\u2019s \u201cA Room of One\u2019s Own,\u201d an extended essay that would become a landmark in feminism from the modernist literary luminary, is also on the list. Her novel \u201cMrs. Dalloway\u201d is already in the U.S. public domain.",
      "While a host of truly major movies will become public in the coming decade, for now early works by major figures from the not-always-stellar early sound era will have to suffice.",
      "A decade before he would move to Hollywood and make films like \u201cPsycho,\u201d and \u201cVertigo,\u201d Alfred Hitchcock made \u201cBlackmail\u201d in Britain. The film was begun as a silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions, one of them the UK\u2019s \u2014 and Hitchcock\u2019s \u2014 first sound film.",
      "John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film\u2019s most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929\u2019s \u201cThe Black Watch,\u201d an adventure epic that includes Ford\u2019s future chief collaborator John Wayne as a young extra.",
      "Cecil B. DeMille, already a Hollywood bigwig through silents, made his first talkie with the melodrama \u201cDynamite.\u201d",
      "Groucho, Harpo and the other Marx Brothers had their first starring movie roles in 1929\u2019s \u201cThe Cocoanuts,\u201d a forerunner to future classics like \u201cAnimal Crackers\u201d and \u201cDuck Soup.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Broadway Melody,\u201d the first sound film and the second film ever to win the Oscar for best picture \u2014 known as \u201coutstanding production\u201d at the time \u2014 will also become public, though it\u2019s often ranked among the worst of best picture winners.",
      "And after \u201cSteamboat Willie\u201d made the earliest Mickey Mouse public, a dozen more of his animations will get the same status, including \u201cThe Karnival Kid,\u201d where he spoke for the first time.",
      "Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties are also about to become public property.",
      "Cole Porter\u2019s compositions \u201cWhat Is This Thing Called Love?\u201d and \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d are among the highlights, as is the jazz classic \u201cAin\u2019t Misbehavin\u2019, written by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks.",
      "\u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain,\u201d which would later forever be associated with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie \u201cThe Hollywood Revue\u201d and will now be public domain.",
      "Different laws regulate sound recordings, and those newly in the public domain date to 1924. They include a recording of \u201cNobody Knows the Trouble I\u2019ve Seen\u201d from future star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson, and \u201cRhapsody in Blue\u201d performed by its composer George Gershwin."

      "The Indian classical music icon died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a chronic lung disease, at a hospital in San Francisco, his family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cHis prolific work as a teacher, mentor and educator has left an indelible mark on countless musicians. He hoped to inspire the next generation to go further. He leaves behind an unparalleled legacy as a cultural ambassador and one of the greatest musicians of all time,\u201d the statement read.",
      "Hussain was the most recognizable exponent of tabla, a pair of hand drums that is the main percussion instrument in Indian classical music.",
      "Considered the greatest tabla player of his generation, Hussain had a career that spanned six decades in which he collaborated with the likes of singer-songwriter George Harrison, jazz saxophonist Charles Lloyd, drummer Mickey Hart and cellist Yo-Yo Ma.",
      "The son of legendary tabla artist Alla Rakha, Hussain was born in 1951 in Mumbai and was taught how to play the instrument by his father at the age of 7. A child prodigy, he was touring by age 12 and performing alongside India\u2019s classical music legends during his teens.",
      "In an interview that was shared widely on social media in India, Hussain says his father welcomed him into the world after he was born by speaking tabla rhythms into his ears.",
      "\u201cI was brought home, handed over to my dad in his arms. The tradition was that the father is supposed to recite a prayer in the baby\u2019s ear ... So he takes me in his arms, puts his lips to my ear and recites the tabla rhythms into my ears,\u201d Hussain says in the interview, verbally imitating the rhythmic pattern of the instrument.",

      "In 1973, Hussain formed the Indian jazz fusion band \u201cShakti\u201d with jazz guitarist John McLaughlin. The band played acoustic fusion music that combined Indian music with elements of jazz, introducing a new sound to Western audiences.",

      "Hussain\u2019s \u201cShakti\u201d won Best Global Music Album, and his collaboration with Edgar Meyer, B\u00e9la Fleck and flutist Rakesh Chaurasia won Best Global Music Performance and Best Contemporary Instrumental Album. He had earlier won a Grammy in 2009.",

      "Kane Brown's fourth studio album, \u201cThe High Road,\u201d is his favorite to date, the country superstar tells The Associated Press in an exclusive interview",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Kane Brown is in his new home studio just outside Nashville, preparing to have the first sit-down conversation about his fourth studio album, \u201cThe High Road.\u201d It's a fitting title, because pounding the pavement is something he's more than familiar with. A few short days ago, he was in Los Angeles, performing at the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball alongside an eclectic mix of the biggest performers \u2014 SZA, Tate McRae, Madison Beer, T-Pain, Paris Hilton and K-pop group NCT Dream among them.",
      "To the untrained ear, it might seem unusual pairing \u2014 one of the great modern country voices alongside pop acts. But genre-mixing? That's something Brown knows a little bit about, too.",
      "Country is at the heart of everything he does \u2014 the genre's narrative style, fiddles, slide guitar and Brown's signature twang carry throughout \u2014 but \u201cThe High Road\u201d isn't afraid to play with different sounds. He says he's \u201calways been kind of nervous to push boundaries and do certain things. But I\u2019ve been here for almost a decade now, so I needed to stop hiding and just do what I love to do. And country is always my number one.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is by far my favorite album, from the sequencing to the songwriting to the different sounds. There\u2019s definitely a song for everybody,\u201d he continues. \u201cMy other albums, I always kind of, you know, cared what people thought about. And this album, we don\u2019t... we gave our everything into the songs.\u201d",
      "He's also no stranger to working with a variety of artists, from regional Mexican country superstar Carin Le\u00f3n on \u201cThe One (Pero No Como Yo),\u201d which released earlier this year, to 2019's \u201cOne Thing Right\u201d with EDM giant Marshmello. The helmet-wearing DJ is back on \u201cThe High Road,\u201d with the radio smash \u201cMiles On It.\u201d",
      "This album, which will be released Jan. 24, includes more features than any other in Brown\u2019s discography, including tracks with Khalid, Jelly Roll, and the legendary Brad Paisley.",
      "They came about naturally: Khalid expressed interest in wanting to go country, Brown helped him make it happen. For the Paisley track \u201cThings We Quit,\u201d Brown shared a video of him singing it on social media, and \u201ca lot of people said, \u2018This sounds like a Brad Paisley song,'\u201d he says, smiling. \u201cAnd it's kind of a comedy country song, a little bit, so he was perfect for that.\u201d",
      "And as for Jelly Roll, on the song \u201cHaunted\u201d? That one was written while Brown was staying in a hotel in Manchester, England.",
      "\u201cIt was this big hotel, and I had the suite, which was a bank vault. So, the bank vault was actually in my room and there were these, like, old paintings on the wall. And we wrote three or four songs that day and we couldn\u2019t think of a song title. And I was like, \u2018This is place is haunted,\u2019\" he recalls. \"Let's write a song called \u2018Haunted,\u2019 about depression and all that. So, I mean, it actually, it came out really quick and, you know, it\u2019s meaningful to me. So hopefully it\u2019ll be meaningful to a lot of other people.\u201d",
      "Jelly Roll has never been one to veer away from topics of mental health, and he made the ideal collaborator. \u201cThat song is so him,\u201d Brown says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t think that I was going to release it, so he was trying to keep it for himself. So that told me that the song meant even more to him than what I thought it was going to mean.\u201d",
      "Important to Brown, no doubt, are two new duets with his wife Katelyn, following the success of their 2023's single \u201cThank God.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur music is about telling our story,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "There's the R&B-pop of \u201cBody Talk,\u201d and a traditionalist's country tune in \u201cDo Us Apart\" \u2014 pulling from a long tradition of country music greats performing with their partners. The latter should come as no surprise. \u201cOur favorite duet to sing together is Randy Travis and Carrie Underwood's \u201cI Told You So,\u201d so we\u2019ve always wanted to have that type of song,\" he says.",
      "And country songs, he's got a lot of them: the jukebox \u201cFiddle in the Band,\u201d the slow-burn \u201cBackseat Driver,\u201d the barstool swaying of \u201cSays I Can.\u201d",
      "Or the closer, \u201c'When You Forget,' a song that I wrote about my granddad with Alzheimer's. To me, that's \u201890s country song storytelling,\u201d he says. \u201cThat's keep the tradition there \u2014 and then I go far left with some other songs.\u201d",
      "On \u201cThe High Road,\u201d Brown believes each track tells a story \u2014 and he looks forward to sharing them, both through the record and on a North American tour next spring.",

      "On Saturday, a tornado touched down around 1:40 p.m. near a shopping mall in Scotts Valley, California, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of San Francisco. The tornado overturned cars and toppled trees and utility poles, the National Weather Service said. The Scotts Valley Police Department said several people were injured and taken to hospitals.",

      "ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E",
      "NEW YORK -- ABC News has agreed to pay $15 million toward Donald Trump\u2019s presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit over anchor George Stephanopoulos' inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll.",
      "As part of the settlement made public Saturday, ABC News posted an editor's note to its website expressing regret over Stephanopoulos' statements during a March 10 segment on his \u201cThis Week\u201d program. The network will also pay $1 million in legal fees to the law firm of Trump\u2019s attorney, Alejandro Brito.",
      "The settlement agreement describes ABC's presidential library payment as a \u201ccharitable contribution,\" with the money earmarked for a non-profit organization that is being established in connection with the yet-to-be built library.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased that the parties have reached an agreement to dismiss the lawsuit on the terms in the court filing,\u201d ABC News spokesperson Jeannie Kedas said.",
      "A Trump spokesperson declined comment.",
      "The settlement agreement was signed Friday, the same day a Florida federal judge ordered Trump and Stephanopoulos to sit for separate depositions in the case next week. The settlement means that sworn testimony is no longer required.",
      "The agreement bore Trump\u2019s bold, distinct signature and an electronic signature with the initials GRS in a space for Stephanopoulos\u2019 name. Debra OConnell, the president of ABC News Group and Disney Entertainment Networks, also e-signed the agreement.",
      "ABC News must transfer the $15 million for Trump's library to an escrow account that's being managed by Brito\u2019s law firm within 10 days, according to the agreement. The network must also pay Brito\u2019s legal fees within 10 days.",
      "While sizeable, ABC's contribution to Trump's presidential library will likely cover just a fraction of the cost. Former President Barack Obama's library in Chicago, for example, was estimated to cost $830 million as of 2021.",
      "Trump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in federal court in Miami days after the network aired the segment, in which the longtime \u201cGood Morning America\u201d anchor and \u201cThis Week\u201d host repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll\u2019s two civil lawsuits against Trump.",
      "During a live \u201cThis Week\u201d interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., Stephanopoulos wrongly claimed that Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d and \u201cdefaming the victim of that rape.\u201d",
      "Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.",
      "In the first of the lawsuits to go to trial, Trump was found liable last year of sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. A jury ordered him to pay her $5 million.",
      "In January, at a second trial in federal court in Manhattan, Trump was found liable on additional defamation claims and ordered to pay Carroll $83.3 million.",
      "Trump is appealing both verdicts.",
      "Carroll, a former advice columnist, went public in a 2019 memoir with her allegation that Trump raped her in the mid-1990s at Bergdorf Goodman, a luxury Manhattan department store across the street from Trump Tower, after they crossed paths at an entrance.",
      "Trump denied her claim, saying he didn't know Carroll and never ran into her at the store.",
      "After Trump lashed out, calling Carroll a \u201cnut job\u201d who invented \u201ca fraudulent and false story\u201d to sell her memoir, she sued him for unspecified monetary damages and sought a retraction of what she said were Trump\u2019s defamatory denials.",
      "Testifying in April 2023, Carroll told jurors: \u201cI\u2019m here because Donald Trump raped me, and when I wrote about it, he said it didn\u2019t happen. He lied and shattered my reputation, and I\u2019m here to try and get my life back.\"",
      "After she'd agreed to help Trump shop for a gift for a woman, Carroll testified that he pushed her against a dressing room wall, stamped his mouth onto hers, yanked down her tights and shoved his hand and then his penis inside her while she struggled against him.",
      "She said she finally kneed him off her and fled.",
      "In upholding the $5 million judgment in the first trial, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan wrote that the unanimous verdict was almost entirely in favor of Carroll, except that the jury concluded she had failed to prove that Trump raped her \u201cwithin the narrow, technical meaning of a particular section of the New York Penal Law.\u201d",
      "Kaplan, who presided over both of Carroll's lawsuits against Trump, said the definition of rape in the state code was \u201cfar narrower\u201d than how rape is defined in common modern parlance, in some dictionaries, in some federal and state criminal statutes and elsewhere.",
      "Under New York law, a rape finding requires vaginal penetration by a penis. Forcible penetration without consent of the vagina or other bodily orifices by fingers or anything else is labeled \u201csexual abuse.\u201d",
      "The judge said the verdict did not mean that Carroll \u201cfailed to prove that Mr. Trump \u2018raped\u2019 her as many people commonly understand the word \u2018rape.\u2019 Indeed ... the jury found that Mr. Trump in fact did exactly that.\u201d",

      "A woman who accused rappers Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of sexually assaulting her when she was 13 at an awards show after-party has acknowledged certain inconsistencies in her story, while her lawyer said he will continue to vet her claims.",
      "The unnamed woman described being driven from Rochester, New York, to New York City for the MTV Video Music Awards in 2000 and then Combs\u2019 limo driver offering her a ride to an after-party, NBC News reported on Friday. She claimed she spoke with musicians Benji Madden and his brother at the party, and her father picked her up after the alleged assault.",
      "But a representative of the Maddens confirmed to NBC that they were on tour in the Midwest during the VMAs, while her father said he doesn\u2019t remember the drive home of more than five hours. The woman\u2019s friend who reportedly drove her to the awards has since died, NBC reported.",
      "The woman had first sued Combs, alleging she was raped at an after-party, and then amended the lawsuit Sunday to include a new allegation that Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, also was at the party and participated in the sexual assault.",
      "Jay-Z said in a statement that the article proves Tony Buzbee, a personal injury lawyer in Houston, filed a false complaint against him for money and fame.",
      "\u201cThis incident didn\u2019t happen and yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,\u201d he said. \u201cTrue Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn\u2019t realize it yet, but, soon.\u201d",
      "Buzbee told The Associated in an email that if someone raises a new issue which didn\u2019t previously exist, his legal team's job is to continue collecting facts and evidence.",

Today, for the second time this week, a Buzbee plaintiff has been exposed. This is the beginning of the end of this shameful money grab.\u201d",
      "The litigation is part of a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs as the hip-hop mogul remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.",
      "The unnamed woman said that while she was in the limousine, she was asked to sign a nondisclosure document. Once at the party, the lawsuit said, she took a drink that made her feel \u201cwoozy and lightheaded\u201d and went into a bedroom to lie down.",
      "She said Combs and Jay-Z then barged into the room, along with another unnamed celebrity, and raped her. The woman said she eventually escaped the room, fled the house and called for a ride from a nearby gas station.",
      "Jay-Z, a 24-time Grammy award winning rapper, producer and music mogul, anonymously sued Buzbee last month, alleging he was attempting to blackmail the rapper by threatening to make the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Jay-Z said Buzbee sent a letter to his lawyer appearing to seek a settlement, which had the \u201copposite effect\u201d on him.",
      "Buzbee previously said the notion that he was trying to blackmail Jay-Z is \u201cstupid and laughable\u201d and his letter simply sought confidential mediation in the litigation.",
      "Buzbee announced at a news conference in October that he represents some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "His firm, which has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers, began filing a wave of lawsuits against the hip-hop mogul a few weeks later.",
      "Combs was denied bail a third time last month. He has pleaded not guilty to charges he coerced and abused women for years and faces trial in May.",
      "Lawyers for Combs did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Jay-Z and Combs are part of a generation of hip-hop titans who rose to prominence in the 2000s, emerging as wide-ranging entrepreneurs and two of the world\u2019s wealthiest rappers. Earlier this year, Forbes estimated Jay-Z\u2019s net worth to be $2.5 billion.",
      "The artists have collaborated over the years, with Jay-Z featured on Combs\u2019 debut album, \u201cNo Way Out,\u201d and Combs appearing on Jay-Z\u2019s sophomore album, \u201cIn My Lifetime, Vol. 1.\u201d",

      "Arjun was arrested after the woman\u2019s husband filed a case against him, his security team and the theater's management for not informing police of the actor\u2019s plan to attend the screening, which resulted in a larger-than-expected crowd.

      "Donald Trump got something this year that no other person designated Time magazine's Person of the Year had ever received",
      "Time magazine gave Donald Trump something it has never done for a Person of the Year designee: a lengthy fact-check of claims he made in an accompanying interview.",
      "The fact-check accompanies a transcript of what the president-elect told the newsmagazine's journalists. Described as a \u201c12 minute read,\u201d it calls into question 15 separate statements that Trump made.",
      "It was the second time Trump earned the Time accolade; he also won in 2016, the first year he was elected president. Time editors said it wasn't a particularly hard choice over other finalists Kamala Harris, Elon Musk, Benjamin Netanyahu and Kate Middleton.",
      "Time said Friday that no other Person of the Year has been fact-checked in the near-century that the magazine has annually written about the figure that has had the greatest impact on the news. But it has done the same for past interviews with the likes of Joe Biden, Netanyahu and Trump.",
      "Such corrections have been a sticking point for Trump and his team in the past, most notably when ABC News did it during his only debate with Democrat Kamala Harris this fall. There was no immediate response to a request for comment on Friday.",
      "In the piece, Time called into question statements Trump made about border security, autism and the size of a crowd at one of his rallies. When the president-elect talked about the \u201cmassive\u201d mandate he had received from voters, Time pointed out that former President Barack Obama won more electoral votes the two times he had run for president.",
      "The magazine also questioned Trump's claim that he would do interviews with anyone who asked during the campaign, if he had the time. The candidate rejected a request to speak to CBS' \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d the magazine said.",
      "\u201cIn the final months of his campaign, Trump prioritized interviews with podcasts over mainstream media,\u201d reporters Simmone Shah and Leslie Dickstein wrote.",

      "\u201cMy Driver and I\u201d was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia\u2019s decades-long cinema ban",
      "JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) \u2014 \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d was supposed to be made in 2016, but was scuttled amid Saudi Arabia's decades-long cinema ban. Eight years later, the landscape for film in the kingdom looks much different \u2014 and the star of \u201cMy Driver and I\u201d now has an award.",
      "Roula Dakheelallah was named the winner of the Chopard Emerging Saudi Talent award at the Red Sea International Film Festival on Thursday. The award \u2014 and the glitzy festival itself \u2014 is a sign of Saudi Arabia's commitment to shaping a new film industry.",
      "\u201cMy heart is attached to cinema and art; I have always dreamed of a moment like this,\u201d Dakheelallah, who still works a 9-5 job, told The Associated Press before the awards ceremony. \u201cI used to work in voluntary films and help my friends in the field, but this is my first big role in a film.\u201d",
      "The reopening of cinemas in 2018 marked a cultural turning point for Saudi Arabia, an absolute monarchy that had instituted the ban 35 years before, under the influence of ultraconservative religious authorities. It has since invested heavily in a native film industry by building theaters and launching programs to support local filmmakers through grants and training.",
      "The Red Sea International Film Festival was launched just a year later, part of an attempt to expand Saudi influence into films, gaming, sports and other cultural fields. Activists have decried the investments as whitewashing the kingdom\u2019s human rights record as it tightly controls speech and remains one of the world\u2019s top executioners. With FIFA awarding the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia this week, Lina al-Hathloul, a Saudi activist with the London-based rights group ALQST, said Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman \u201chas really managed to create this bubble where people only see entertainment and they don\u2019t see the reality on the ground.\u201d",
      "These efforts are part of Vision 2030, an ambitious reform plan unveiled in 2016 to ease the economy's dependence on oil. As part of it, Saudi Arabia plans to construct 350 cinemas with over 2,500 movie screens \u2014 by this past April, across 22 cities, it already had 66 cinemas showing movies from the local film industry, as well as Hollywood and Bollywood. (The Red Sea International Film Festival attracts a host of talent from the latter industries, with Viola Davis and Priyanka Chopra Jonas also picking up awards Thursday.)",
      "The country's General Entertainment Authority last month opened Al Hisn Studios on the outskirts of Riyadh. As one of the largest such production hubs in the Middle East, it not only includes several film studios but also a production village with workshops for carpentry, blacksmithing and fashion tailoring.",
      "\u201cThese facilities, when they exist, will stimulate filmmakers,\u201d said Saudi actor Mohammed Elshehri. \u201cToday, no writer or director has an excuse to imagine and say, \u2018I cannot implement my imagination.\u2019\u201d",
      "The facilities are one part of the equation \u2014 the content itself is another. One of the major players in transforming Saudi filmmaking has been Telfaz11, a media company founded in 2011 that began as a YouTube channel and quickly became a trailblazer. Producing high-quality digital content such as short films, comedy sketches and series, Telfaz11 offered fresh perspectives on Saudi and regional issues.",
      "In 2020, Telfaz11 signed a partnership with Netflix to produce original content for the streaming giant. The result has been movies that demonstrate an evolution on the storytelling level, tackling topics that were once off-limits and sensitive to the public like secret nightlife in \u201cMandoob\u201d (\u201cNight Courier\u201d) and changing social norms in \u201cNaga.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think we tell our stories in a very simple way, and that\u2019s what reaches the world,\u201d Elshehri says of the changing shift. \u201cWhen you tell your story in a natural way without any affectation, it will reach every person.\u201d",
      "But the films were not without their critics, drawing mixed reaction. Social media discoursed ranged from pleasure that Saudi film were tackling such topics to anger over how the films reflected conservative society.",
      "As Hana Al-Omair, a Saudi writer and director, points out, there are still many stories left untold.",
      "\u201cWe certainly have a long time ahead of us before we can tell the Saudi narrative as it should be,\u201d she said, acknowledging that there are still barriers and rampant censorship. \u201cThe Goat Life,\u201d a Malayalam-language movie about an Indian man forced to work without pay in Saudi Arabia, is not available on Netflix's platform in the country. Movies that explore political topics or LGBTQ+ stories are essentially out of the question.",
      "Even \u201cMy Driver and I,\u201d featured at the Red Sea festival alongside 11 other Saudi feature-length films, was initially too controversial. It centers on a Sudanese man in Jeddah, living away from his own daughter, who feels responsible for the girl he drives as her parents are absent. It was initially blocked from being made because of the relationship between the girl and the driver, filmmaker Ahd Kamel has said, even though it's not a romantic relationship.",
      "Now in 2024, the film is a success story \u2014 a symbol of the Saudi film industry's evolution as well as the growing role of women like Kamel behind the camera and Dakheelallah in front of it.",
      "\u201cI see the change in Saudi cinema, a very beautiful change and it is moving at a wonderful speed. In my opinion, we do not need to rush,\u201d Dakheelallah said. \u201cWe need to guide the truth of the artistic movement that is happening in Saudi Arabia.\u201d"

Kennedy Jr. swept onto Capitol Hill late Monday as the anti-vaccine health guru from the famous political family reintroduced himself to senators, this time as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's Health and Human Services Department.",
      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",
      "Kennedy's first stop Monday was on potentially friendly terrain, to the offices of a few GOP senators allied with Trump, the start of a robust, weeks-long process.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, said Kennedy told him, \u201cI 100% support the polio vaccination.\u201d But Mullin added that their conversation also turned to other childhood vaccinations. He predicts Kennedy will be confirmed.",
      "\u201cThe more you talk to him, the more he explains it, the more you like him,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",
      "HHS has a broad reach across the lives of Americans \u2014 inspecting the nation's food, regulating medicines and overseeing research of diseases and cures. It provides health insurance for nearly half of the country \u2014 poor, disabled and older Americans, including via Medicare.",

      "Ahead of Kennedy's arrival he was given a word of advice from one important voice: outgoing Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, who cautioned the nominee against views opposing the vaccine.",
      "\u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\u201d McConnell said recently.",
      "Trump said Monday during his own press conference he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in polio vaccines and sought to tamp down fears about Kennedy, saying he will be \u201cmuch less radical\u201d than people think.",
      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",
      "\u201cWell, I think he\u2019ll have to address that,\u201d Thune said. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out.\u201d",
      "But hardline Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, a House member who has no vote in the confirmation process, has been influential in supporting and amplifying Kennedy\u2019s views on vaccines.",
      "In the Capitol on Monday, Republican senators said they want to hear more about Kennedy\u2019s views.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m open,\" said GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina. But \u201cif you come in and say I won\u2019t consider myself successful unless I eliminate these vaccines, that could be problematic.\u201d",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",
      "Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley says he\u2019s interested in what Kennedy says about pigs \u201cbecause Iowa is the number one pig producer.\u201d",
      "Other Trump nominees are also expected back on Capitol Hill this week. The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

      "LONDON -- A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby said Monday that he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution's leading expert changed his opinion on how three babies died.",
      "Dr. Dewi Evans's testimony is no longer credible after he reversed his opinion that Letby killed three infants by injecting air down a nasal gastric tube, attorney Mark McDonald said.",
      "\u201cThe defense will argue that Dr. Evans is not a reliable expert, and given that he was the lead expert for the prosecution, we say that all the convictions are not safe,\u201d McDonald said.",
      "Letby, 34, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to murder seven others while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service defended the verdicts.",
      "\u201cTwo juries and three appeal court judges have reviewed a multitude of different strands of evidence against Lucy Letby,\u201d a CPS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cIn May, the Court of Appeal dismissed Letby\u2019s leave to appeal on all grounds \u2014 rejecting her argument that expert prosecution evidence was flawed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said at trial that Letby's methods left little trace and included injecting air into their bloodstreams, poisoning them with insulin and interfering with breathing tubes. Prosecutors said she was a \u201cconstant malevolent presence\" and was alone on duty in the neonatal unit when the children collapsed or died.",
      "Letby, who testified at two trials that she never harmed a child, has stood by her claims of innocence.",
      "Experts said it is unusual to ask the Court of Appeal to reopen its previous decision to reject a case and would require convincing evidence to succeed.",
      "\u201cIt is vanishingly rare for a lead expert witness in a criminal case to \u2018change his mind\u2019 on key evidence,\" said defense lawyer Sean Caulfield, who is not involved in the case. \u201cIt is also rare for there to be a bid to reopen an appeal after it has already been refused by the Court of Appeal. I have never seen these two things happen in unison during my 20-year plus career. It is quite an astonishing turn of events.\"",
      "McDonald said 15 medical experts around the world are reviewing trial evidence.",

      "Evans has not yet responded to a request for comment following McDonald's news conference.",
      "Additionally, two neonatologists working with the defense said there were medical reasons Baby C and Baby O became ill and could not be resuscitated, McDonald said."

      "\u201cYou could say, \u2018Gosh, thanks for asking, but I don\u2019t talk politics over the holidays,\u2019\u201d Mirgain suggested.",
      "The holidays can be difficult for people who are grieving or don\u2019t have anyone nearby with whom to celebrate.",
      "\u201cLoneliness and isolation can feel exacerbated during the holiday season when you look around and it seems like everyone\u2019s getting together and you don\u2019t have plans, or you\u2019re not looking forward to your plans,\u201d Mirgain said.",
      "Find ways to connect with people if that\u2019s something you\u2019re craving, like scheduling calls with people across the country or volunteering in your community.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much opportunity to give back during this time, and I think generosity is one of the best things we can do for our own well-being,\u201d she said.",
      "And if you\u2019re grieving the death of someone close to you, the holidays can be the perfect time to reflect on that person's legacy, said Dr. Ellen Lee, a geriatric psychiatrist at UC San Diego Health.",
      "\"Try to honor that person by visiting their grave site or doing something they really loved to do, and then find people to share those memories with,\u201d Lee said. She also advises people not to tamp down feelings but let yourself grieve.",
      "Gifts, dinners, decorations \u2014 it\u2019s all a lot to keep track of around this time of year, and it\u2019s easy to feel overwhelmed. Those extra expenses and get-togethers can put more stress on your mental health.",
      "For milder symptoms of depression, anxiety or mood issues, lean on tried-and-true methods of self-care, experts said, such as spending time doing something you love or watching a movie.",
      "But it's important to reach out for help if you start to feel mounting financial anxiety or intensifying symptoms that impair your ability to function. Early intervention can keep them from intensifying, Mirgain said, adding that if you have suicidal thoughts, reach out to your provider. You can also call or text 988 or chat at 988Lifeline.org.",
      "Remember, your holidays don\u2019t have to be a Hallmark movie. Give yourself permission to do it differently this year, Lee said.",
      "\u201cWe have so many goals, so many targets,\u201d she said. \u201cGetting all the gifts, decorating the house perfectly \u2026 sometimes it\u2019s helpful to sort of focus on the most important part of it.\u201d",
      "That can look different depending on who you are: The most important part may be spending time with people you don\u2019t get to see often, or having a nice meal with your favorite foods.",
      "Lee emphasized that it is fine to have a low-key celebration.",
      "\u201cI ask people, \u2018What\u2019s the best part of the holiday?\u2019\" she said, \"It\u2019s not usually about the decorations or all these extra things that we all spend a lot of time worrying about.\u201d",

      "ISLAMABAD -- Pakistan on Monday began its last nationwide vaccination campaign for the year to protect 45 million children from polio after a surge in new cases hampered efforts to stop the disease, officials said.",
      "According to the World Health Organization, Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan remain the only two countries where the potentially fatal, paralyzing virus hasn\u2019t been stopped,",
      "Pakistan has reported 63 confirmed cases since January.",
      "Ayesha Raza Farooq, the prime minister\u2019s adviser for the polio eradication program, said the anti-polio drive will continue until Dec. 22.",

      "Authorities deployed thousands of police officers to protect health workers following intelligence reports that insurgents could target them. However, gunmen opened fire Monday on police escorting polio workers in Karak, a city in the restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, killing a police officer and wounding a health worker, local police official Ayaz Khan said.",
      "Also on Monday, a gunman riding on a motorcycle shot and wounded a police officer assigned to escort polio workers from a health facility in the northwestern city of Bannu, said local police chief Hamid Khan.",

      "Afghanistan reported at least 23 confirmed cases in 2024, according to data from the World Health Organization.",
      "In September, the Afghan Taliban suddenly stopped a door-to-door vaccination campaign in Afghanistan, a devastating setback for polio eradication as the virus is one of the world\u2019s most infectious and any unvaccinated groups of children where the virus is spreading could undo years of progress.",

      "Health and tourism officials in Fiji say seven foreign tourists have been hospitalized after drinking cocktails at a resort bar",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Seven foreign tourists were hospitalized in Fiji after drinking cocktails at a resort bar, Fijian authorities said on Monday.",
      "The cause of their illness was not known and officials said it was too soon to know if tainted alcohol was involved.",
      "Those who became ill at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka on Saturday included Australians and an American, according to local news reports. They were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, said Jemesa Tudravu, a Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson.",
      "Two people remained in the hospital, conscious and in stable condition, Fiji's Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka told reporters on Monday. One person was discharged on Sunday and four others on Monday.",
      "David Sandoe, an Australian man who said his daughter and granddaughter were hospitalized, told Sky News Australia that his relatives had been released from the hospital and were due to fly home on Monday night.",
      "Local news outlets reported on Sunday that the cause of the foreigners' illness was suspected alcohol poisoning, similar to a case in Laos in November in which six tourists \u2014 including two Australian teenagers \u2014 died after consuming tainted drinks.",
      "But Tudravu said no cause had been identified in the Fiji episode. Police have ordered toxicology tests and are awaiting results \u2014 which are expected to take three or four days \u2014 Gavoka said.",
      "The bar was full of customers on Saturday night and many had ordered pi\u00f1a coladas, the drink consumed by those who became ill, said the official.",
      "Gavoka said no other reports of similar illness were recorded at the resort or across Fiji, a South Pacific island nation of 930,000 people.",
      "\u201cThe resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\u201d Gavoka said. The hotel, located on the picturesque Coral Coast of the largest island, Viti Levu, has operated for many years and \u201cholds a strong reputation,\u201d he added.",
      "\u201cThis is the only reported case of its kind that we\u2019ve experienced in recent memory, and certainly nothing like this has been experienced this year,\u201d Gavoka said.",

      "The ministry did not comment on the cause of the Australians' illness, but its website advising tourists was updated on Monday to caution travelers about \u201cpotential risks around drink spiking and methanol poisoning through consuming alcoholic drinks.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the resort, Savaira Molaucake, said staff were \u201cconducting a thorough investigation\u201d of the incident and were working closely with authorities."

      "Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a childhood polio survivor, said any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s picks requiring Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, says any of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominees seeking Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d McConnell said in a statement Friday. \u201cAnyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "The 82-year-old lawmaker\u2019s statement appeared to be directed at Trump\u2019s pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after a report that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022. That vaccine is widely considered to have halted the disease in most parts of the world.",
      "McConnell's words were a sign that Kennedy, who has long advanced the debunked idea that vaccines cause autism, could face some resistance in the soon-to-be GOP-controlled Senate.",
      "\u201cMr. Kennedy believes the Polio Vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied,\u201d said Katie Miller, the transition spokeswoman for Kennedy, in response to questions.",
      "The New York Times reported that the petition was filed by a lawyer now helping Kennedy select candidates for federal health positions in the incoming administration.",
      "Any individual or company can file a petition with the Food and Drug Administration, which typically fields hundreds of requests at any time relating to various food, drug and medical issues. Most petitions are denied, but the FDA is required to respond to each one in writing.",
      "Vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real-world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades \u2014 they are considered among the most effective public health measures in history.",
      "McConnell contracted polio at 2 years old but survived because of \u201cthe miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother\u2019s love,\" according to the statement. He praised the \u201csaving power\u201d of the polio vaccine for the \u201cmillions who came after me.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a post on X that it was \u201coutrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives.",
      "He said Kennedy should clarify his own position on it.",
      "Trump announced last month his selection of Kennedy, saying Kennedy would work to protect Americans \u201cfrom harmful chemicals, pollutants, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and food additives.\u201d",
      "But that pick was met with alarm from scientists and public health officials, who fear Kennedy would unwind lifesaving public health initiatives such as vaccines.",
      "Kennedy has pushed other conspiracy theories regarding vaccines, such as that COVID-19 could have been \u201cethnically targeted\u201d to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people, comments he later said were taken out of context. He has repeatedly brought up the Holocaust when discussing vaccines and public health mandates.",
      "Kennedy said he plans to remake the Department of Health and Human Services, an agency with sprawling reach and a $1.3 trillion budget, if he is approved. He has suggested the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma,\u201d and his anti-vaccine nonprofit has called on it to stop using COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "During the COVID-19 epidemic, his nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, petitioned the FDA to halt the use of all COVID vaccines. The group has alleged that the FDA is beholden to \u201cbig pharma\u201d because it receives much of its budget from industry fees and some employees who have departed the agency have gone on to work for drugmakers.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit."

      "If you're planning to stay sober during this holiday season, experts suggest following some practical tips",
      "Last year, when Lauren Haydel began her first sober holiday season, she wondered how difficult it would be to avoid alcohol at family parties and celebrations with friends. She owns a boutique, Fleurty Girl, in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter, a neighborhood synonymous with drinking.",
      "But few people questioned her choice. \u201cInstead of them asking me why,\u201d Haydel says, \u201cthey ask me, \u2019Oh, do you feel better?'\u201d",
      "Many friends told her they\u2019re considering avoiding alcohol themselves.",
      "Sobriety has been having a moment, says Jessica Jeboult, founder of the website and online community A Sober Girl\u2019s Guide.",
      "\u201cThis is the ultimate time to rediscover or change your relationship with alcohol,\u201d she says. With so many alcohol-free products available and growing awareness about the benefits of staying sober, \u201cthere is maximum support.\u201d",
      "If you are planning to stay sober this holiday season, here are tips from sober coaches, sober bar managers and happily sober people:",
      "\u201cHaving something in your hand just ups your comfort level, because you feel like you\u2019re socializing with this thing in your hand, instead of standing there with your hands at your side,\u201d says Abby Ehmann, who owns Hekate Cafe and Elixir Lounge, a sober bar on New York City\u2019s Lower East Side.",
      "It can help to choose your alcohol-free options in advance. If you prefer something that reminds you of alcohol, sample some of the many non-alcoholic wines and beers on the market (they\u2019re not all equally tasty) and check which are on the menu at a bar or restaurant you\u2019ll be visiting.",
      "If you\u2019ll be hosting a party or attending one at someone\u2019s home, you also can mix up your own mocktail recipes in advance.",
      "\u201cTreat these drinks like they\u2019re really special,\u201d says Vermont-based chef Suzanne Podhaizer, who makes an assortment of mocktails when she entertains.",
      "Don\u2019t forget the garnish, she says: \u201cConsider putting a sugar rim on your glasses or using luster dust on top. The more you make the non-alcoholic drinks feel celebratory, the better people are going to feel.\u201d",
      "Mocktails also make great hostess gifts. Mix up a batch of your favorite recipe, pour it into a large Mason jar and tie it with a ribbon to bring with you.",
      "This year, plan to gather somewhere other than a bar. It\u2019s the perfect season \u201cto have some lovely hot chocolates, take them outdoors and go ice skating,\u201d says Kate Baily, a women\u2019s health coach in the U.K. and host of the podcast Love Sober.",
      "If you\u2019re invited to an event that is all about drinking, give yourself permission to skip it, says Adam Cannon, a real estate agent in Pittsburgh who has been sober for 18 years.",
      "In his industry, \u201cat this time of year, there\u2019s a different networking event every night of the week,\u201d Cannon says. He opts not to go if \u201costensibly, it\u2019s about networking, but it\u2019s at a bar. People are getting hammered.\u201d",
      "Even if it\u2019s your habit to stay out late, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to do what you\u2019ve always done at this particular Christmas party,\u201d Haydel says. Drop in for the first hour, then allow yourself to leave when you wish.",
      "You won\u2019t miss much. \u201cThere\u2019s a witching hour when you\u2019re out at a bar or drinking with friends,\u201d Jeboult says. \u201cWhen people get past two drinks, three drinks, the stories are the same.\u201d",
      "If need be, slip out without explanation. Whether you call it a \u201cFrench exit\u201d or an \u201cIrish goodbye,\u201d it\u2019s totally an option.",
      "If you\u2019re feeling stressed during a holiday gathering, \u201ctake a time out,\u201d Jeboult says. Escape to the bathroom, step outside for a minute or go for a walk.",
      "Snack breaks help, too. Jay Bridwell, a recovery counselor at Red Rock Behavioral Health in Oklahoma City, often uses the acronym HALT with patients in addiction recovery. If you are \u201cHungry, Angry, Lonely or Tired,\u201d he says, you may be more likely to reach for alcohol. So build in time for rest and meals.",
      "And have a plan if things get tough. Whether it\u2019s an Alcoholics Anonymous sponsor, a sober relative or a group text with healthy friends, stay connected with people who will support you, Bridwell says. You can also join an online sober group and follow sobriety-related social media accounts.",
      "Map out multiple transportation options, rather than relying on one person for a ride home from a party. You\u2019ll have less stress, and feel less motivated to temper stress with alcohol, if you have the freedom to leave when you wish.",
      "During her first sober holiday season last year, Haydel reveled in meaningful conversations and the joy of waking up feeling good each morning with clear memories of the night before.",
      "\u201cSobriety is the gift that you keep on giving to your future self over and over and over again,\u201d says Eliott Edge, who manages Hekate, the sober bar.",
      "Focus on enjoying this very real gift, Baily says. Take your time getting dressed, visualizing yourself having a great time, and imagine how you\u2019ll feel as your head hits the pillow when you get home.",
      "As a finishing touch, plan a reward for the next day. Maybe a breakfast date with a friend or a morning walk in the park that will feel especially good because you won\u2019t be hung over.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got the best bits of the evening,\u201d Baily says, \u201cand there are no costs.\u201d"

      "North Carolina's highest court has ruled over some insurance claims filed by businesses that were harmed financially by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting 2020 government orders limiting commerce and public movement",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina's Supreme Court issued mixed rulings Friday for businesses seeking financial help from the COVID-19 pandemic, declaring one insurer's policy must cover losses some restaurants and bars incurred but that another insurer's policy for a nationwide clothing store chain doesn't due to an exception.",
      "The unanimous decisions by the seven-member court in the pair of cases addressed the requirements of \u201call-risk\u201d commercial property insurance policies issued by Cincinnati and Zurich American insurance companies to the businesses.",
      "The companies who paid premiums saw reduced business and income, furloughed or laid off employees or even closed from the coronavirus and resulting 2020 state and local government orders limiting commerce and public movement. North Carolina restaurants, for example, were forced for some time to limit sales to takeout or drive-in orders.",
      "In one case, the 16 eating and drinking establishments who sued The Cincinnati Insurance Co., The Cincinnati Casualty Co. and others held largely similar policies that protected their building and personal property as well as any business income from \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to property not excluded by their policies.",
      "Worried that coverage would be denied for claimed losses, the restaurants and bars sued and sought a court to rule that \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d also applied to government-mandated orders, a court opinion said. A trial judge sided with them, but a panel of the intermediate-level Court of Appeals disagreed, saying such claims did not have to be accepted because there was no actual physical harm to the property \u2014 only a loss of business.",
      "But state Supreme Court Associate Justice Anita Earls, writing for the court, noted he Cincinnati policies did not define \u201cdirect physical loss.\u201d Earls also noted there were no specific policy exclusions that would deny coverage for viruses or contaminants. Earls said the court favored any ambiguity toward the policyholders because a reasonable person in their positions would understand the policies include coverage for business income lost from virus-related government orders.",
      "\"It is the insurance company\u2019s responsibility to define essential policy terms and the North Carolina courts\u2019 responsibility to enforce those terms consistent with the parties\u2019 reasonable expectations,\" Earls wrote.",
      "In the other ruling, the Supreme Court said Cato Corp., which operates more than 1,300 U.S. clothing stores and is headquartered in Charlotte, was properly denied coverage through its \u201call-risk\u201d policy. Zurich American Insurance Co. had refused to cover Cato\u2019s alleged losses, and Cato sued.",
      "But while Cato sufficiently alleged a \u201cdirect physical loss of or damage\u201d to property, Earls wrote in another opinion, the policy contained a viral contamination exclusion that Zurich American proved applied in this case.",
      "The two cases were among eight related to COVID-19 claims on which the Supreme Court heard oral arguments over two days in October. The justices have yet to rule on most of those matters.",
      "The court did announce Friday that justices were equally divided about a lawsuit filed by then-University of North Carolina students seeking tuition, housing and fee refunds when in-person instruction was canceled during the 2020 spring semester. The Court of Appeals had agreed it was correct to dismiss the suit \u2014 the General Assembly had passed a law that gave colleges immunity from such pandemic-related legal claims for that semester. Only six of the justices decided the case \u2014 Associate Justice Tamara Barringer did not participate \u2014 so the 3-3 deadlock means the Court of Appeals decision stands."

    "summary": "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine",
    "story": [
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine",
      "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas, launching one of the first challenges in the U.S. to shield laws that Democrat-controlled states passed to protect physicians after Roe v. Wade was overturned.",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Collin County, and it was announced Friday.",
      "Such prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the U.S. even since state bans started taking effect. Most abortions in the U.S. involve pills rather than procedures.",
      "Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, said a challenge to shield laws, which blue states started adopting in 2023, has been anticipated.",
      "And it could have a chilling effect on prescriptions.",
      "\u201cWill doctors be more afraid to mail pills into Texas, even if they might be protected by shield laws because they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re protected by shield laws?\u201d Ziegler said in an interview Friday.",
      "The lawsuit accuses New York Dr. Maggie Carpenter of violating Texas law by providing the drugs to a Texas patient and seeks up to $250,000. No criminal charges are involved.",
      "Texas bars abortion at all stages of pregnancy and has been one of the most aggressive states at pushing back against abortion rights. It began enforcing a state law in 2021 \u2014 even before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans \u2014 that barred nearly all abortions by allowing citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion or assists someone in obtaining one.",
      "Paxton said that the 20-year-old woman who received the pills ended up in a hospital with complications. It was only after that, the state said in its filing, that the man described as \u201cthe biological father of the unborn child\u201d learned of the pregnancy and the abortion.",
      "\"In Texas, we treasure the health and lives of mothers and babies, and this is why out-of-state doctors may not illegally and dangerously prescribe abortion-inducing drugs to Texas residents,\u201d Paxton said in a statement.",
      "The state said the Texas woman received a combination of two drugs that are generally used in medication abortions. Mifepristone blocks the hormone progesterone and primes the uterus to respond to the contraction-causing effect of the second drug, misoprostol. The two-drug regimen can be used to end pregnancies up through 10 weeks, but the drugs also have other uses and can help induce labor, manage miscarriages or treat hemorrhage.",
      "The Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, where Carpenter is co-medical director and founder, said in a statement that shield laws are essential to preserving abortion access.",
      "\u201cKen Paxton is prioritizing his anti-abortion agenda over the health and well-being of women by attempting to shut down telemedicine abortion nationwide,\u201d the group said. \u201cBy threatening access to safe and effective reproductive health care, he is putting women directly in harm\u2019s way.\u201d",
      "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and Attorney General Letitia James, both Democrats, said they would defend reproductive freedom.",
      "\u201cAs other states move to attack those who provide or obtain abortion care, New York is proud to be a safe haven for abortion access,\u201d James said in a prepared statement. \u201cWe will always protect our providers from unjust attempts to punish them for doing their job and we will never cower in the face of intimidation or threats.\u201d",
      "It was not clear what specific actions Hochul or James would take.",
      "While most Republican-controlled states began enforcing bans or tighter restrictions on abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned, most Democratic states have adopted laws that aim to protect their residents from investigation or prosecution under other states' abortion laws. At least eight states have gone farther, offering legal protections to health care providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states where abortion is banned. That scenario makes up for about 10% of all abortions in the U.S., a survey for the Society of Family Planning found.",
      "The New York shield law includes a provision that allows a prescriber who is sued to countersue the plaintiff to recover damages.",
      "That makes the Texas lawsuit thorny.",
      "Even if Paxton prevails in Texas court, Ziegler said, it's unclear how that could be enforced. \u201cIs he going to go to New York to enforce it?\u201d she asked.",
      "Still, anti-abortion groups cheered the filing and abortion rights supporters derided it.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates, who legally challenged the Biden administration\u2019s prescribing rules around mifepristone, have been readying provocative and unusual ways to further limit abortion pill access when Trump takes office next year. They feel emboldened to challenge the pills\u2019 use and seek ways to restrict it under a conservative U.S. Supreme Court buttressed by a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a group of anti-abortion doctors and their organizations lacked the legal standing to sue to try to have the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of mifepristone rescinded. But since then, the Republican state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri have sought to have some of the rules around the pills tightened \u2014 including to bar telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "Also this year, Louisiana became the first state to reclassify the drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d They can still be prescribed, but there are extra steps required to access them.",
      "Lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, New Hampshire and Tennessee \u2014 have introduced bills for next year that would bar or restrict use of the pills.",
      "\u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d said Tennessee state Rep. Gino Bulso, who is sponsoring the legislation there targeting medications used in abortions.",

      "That was the day the NYPD released surveillance images showing the face of the suspected shooter as he checked into a Manhattan hostel.",
      "\u201cAmong multiple tips received by FBI New York from the public and law enforcement regarding the homicide in Midtown Manhattan on December 4, 2024, a tip was received from the San Francisco Police Department regarding the possible identity of the suspect,\u201d the FBI confirmed in a statement Friday.",
      "The FBI statement didn\u2019t provide further detail about the nature of the tip or say when it was received but said agents in New York had \u201cconducted routine investigative activity and referred this and other leads to the New York City Police Department.\u201d",
      "Mangione was arrested Monday, Dec. 9, after an employee at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, phoned police saying that there was a person eating breakfast in the restaurant who looked like the person being sought as the gunman.",
      "The NYPD's chief of detectives, Joseph Kenny, said at the time that the department's investigators didn't have Mangione's name until he turned up in that McDonald's.",

      "The killing has been viewed as a violent expression of widespread anger at the insurance industry. Witty said people in the company were struggling to make sense of the killing, as well as the vitriol and threats directed at colleagues.",
      "Police have said that Mangione was found with a gun that matched shell casings found at the scene of the shooting and a three-page letter in which he lamented the high cost of health care in the U.S. and singled out UnitedHealthcare for its profits and size. The company, a division of UnitedHealth Group, is the largest U.S. health insurer. Mangione is currently being held in Pennsylvania and intends to plead not guilty to a murder charge in New York, his lawyer has said.",

      "\u201cHis dad spent more than 40 years unloading trucks at grain elevators. B.T., as we knew him, worked farm jobs as a kid and fished at a gravel pit with his brother. He never forgot where he came from, because it was the needs of people who live in places like Jewell, Iowa, that he considered first in finding ways to improve care,\u201d Witty wrote.",

      "McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work for opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma, according to court papers filed in Virginia",
      "BOSTON -- McKinsey & Company consulting firm has agreed to pay $650 million to settle a federal investigation into its work to help opioids manufacturer Purdue Pharma boost the sales of the highly addictive drug OxyContin, according to court papers filed in Virginia on Friday.",
      "As part of the deal with the U.S. Justice Department, McKinsey will avoid prosecution on criminal charges if it pays the sum and follows certain conditions for five years, including ceasing any work on the sale, marketing or promotion of controlled substances.",
      "A former McKinsey senior partner, Martin Elling, has also agreed to plead guilty to obstruction of justice for deleting documents from his laptop after he became aware of investigations into Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin that was then a client, according to the filings. A lawyer for Elling declined to comment Friday.",
      "McKinsey said in a statement on Friday that it's \u201cdeeply sorry\u201d for its work for Purdue Pharma.",
      "\u201cWe should have appreciated the harm opioids were causing in our society and we should not have undertaken sales and marketing work for Purdue Pharma,\u201d the company said. \u201cThis terrible public health crisis and our past work for opioid manufacturers will always be a source of profound regret for our firm.\u201d",
      "It's the latest effort by federal prosecutors to hold accountable companies officials say helped fuel the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids linked to more than 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years. For the past decade, most of them have been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Earlier in the epidemic, prescription pills were the primary cause of death.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to about $50 billion worth of settlements with governments \u2014 with most of the money required to be used to fight the crisis.",
      "Purdue paid McKinsey more than $93 million over 15 years for several products, including how to improve revenue from OxyContin. Prosecutors say McKinsey \u201cknew the risk and dangers\u201d of OxyContin and knew that Purdue Pharma executives had previously pleaded guilty to crimes related to the promotion of the drug, but decided to work with the opioid manufacturer anyway.",
      "One of the jobs for McKinsey, the papers said, was to identify which prescribers would generate the most additional prescriptions if Purdue salespeople focused on that. That resulted in prescriptions that \u201cwere not for a medically accepted indication, were unsafe, ineffective, and medically unnecessary, and that were often diverted for uses that lacked a legitimate medical purpose,\u201d the filing said.",
      "\u201cThis was not hypothetical,\" Christopher Kavanaugh, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Virginia Christopher Kavanaugh said in a news conference in Boston on Friday. \u201cThis was not just marketing. It was a strategy. It was executed and it worked.\u201d",
      "During work to \u201cturbocharge\u201d Purdue sales in 2013 after a drop in business, McKinsey consultants accompanied Purdue sales representatives on visits to prescribers and pharmacies to gather information. In a note about one ride-along, a McKinsey consultant said one pharmacist had a gun \u201cand was shaking; abuse is definitely a huge issue.\u201d The company continued looking for ways to increase OxyContin sales, according to court papers.",
      "In 2014, McKinsey identified some small clinics that were writing more opioid prescriptions than entire hospital systems \u2014 and suggested they be targeted for more sales, the court filing said.",
      "The company also tried to help Purdue get a say in shaping federal rules intended to ensure the benefits of addictive prescription drugs outweighed the risks. The government said in its new filings that that resulted in making high-dose OxyContin subject to the same oversight as lower-dose opioids and made training for prescribers voluntary rather than mandatory.",
      "Since 2021, McKinsey has agreed to pay state and local governments about $765 million in settlements for its role in advising businesses on how to sell more of the powerful prescription painkillers amid a national opioid crisis.",
      "The firm also agreed last year to pay health care funds and insurance companies $78 million.",
      "Federal authorities say the deal represents the first time a management consulting firm is being held accountable like this for advising a client to break the law.",
      "\u201cIf a consulting first conspires with a client to engage in criminal conduct, the fact that you\u2019re an outside consultant will not protect you,\u201d said Joshua Levy, U.S. Attorney for Massachusetts.",
      "Some advocates say the opioid crisis was touched off when Purdue Pharma\u2019s OxyContin hit the market in 1996.",
      "Three Purdue executives pleaded guilty to misbranding charges in 2007 and the company agreed to pay a fine. The company pleaded guilty to criminal charges in 2020 and agreed to $8.3 billion in penalties and forfeitures \u2014 most of which will be waived as long as it executes a settlement through bankruptcy court that is still in the works.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, a smile spreads across the little girl\u2019s face. Blinking behind her glasses, she inches her wheelchair forward and gently reaches out to stroke the tiny gray horse.",
      "Soon, 9-year-old Josifina Topa Mazuch is beaming as she leads Ivi, a specially trained miniature horse, standing no taller than her pink wheelchair, through the school hallway.",
      "\u201cI really want them to come again,\u201d Josifina said of Ivi and a second miniature horse, Calypso, after a November morning visit to her Athens primary school for children with special needs. \u201cThey made me feel really happy.\u201d",
      "Ivi and Calypso are two of nine tiny equines from Gentle Carousel Greece, a Greek offshoot of Florida-based charity Gentle Carousel Miniature Therapy Horses offering visits to hospitals, rehabilitation centers and care homes.",
      "Trained over two years to work comfortably in confined environments and with vulnerable children and adults, the horses, which stand about 75 centimeters (30 inches) tall, provide a form of pet therapy that carers say offers valuable interactions and learning experiences, particularly to people confined to hospitals or care homes.",
      "But the charity they are part of is struggling to make ends meet \u2014 run by one woman who funds the entire operation herself, with one assistant and no support team.",
      "Started in 2014 by Mina Karagianni, an interior architect and designer, the Athens operation is the only one affiliated with the Florida-based charity outside the United States. Karagianni came across Gentle Carousel while scouring the internet for information on caring for an abandoned Shetland pony she had rescued.",
      "When she saw photos of the charity\u2019s work in pediatric oncology wards, \u201cI was touched and I was moved, and I said: \u2018OK, we have to bring this to Greece,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "It took months to track down and persuade the U.S. charity to work with her, and even longer to obtain the requisite permits and arrange transport to bring the horses over. But after incessant efforts, six already trained miniature horses stepped off a flight from Florida via Frankfurt in November 2013.",
      "Entirely self-funded through her day job, Karagianni now has a total of nine equines \u2014 the six American miniature horses, one that was later born in Greece, and two rescued ponies - Billy the Shetland pony and Giselle who was rescued from the island of Santorini.",
      "Karagianni transformed her family land in Rafina, a seaside area east of Athens, into Magic Garden, complete with stables, a paddock for the horses to run free every day, a small caf\u00e9 and an area to host children\u2019s parties and baptisms.",
      "At the time, she was open for visits every weekend, charging a small entrance fee to help cover running costs \u2013 specialized food for the horses, wood shavings for their bedding, grooming material, veterinarian visits and transportation to and from hospitals and care homes. She also began visiting schools and setting up an education program.",
      "From 2014 when Gentle Carousel Greece first opened until the first COVID-19 lockdowns in 2020, Karagianni said her little equine team saw roughly 12,000 children.",
      "But the lockdowns took their toll. Karagianni had to shut down the caf\u00e9 and hasn\u2019t been able to re-open since.",
      "With even the tiny income from the caf\u00e9 drying up, and Karagianni herself facing a health issue that took her out for 1 \u00bd years, \u201cwe fell apart,\u201d she said. Unable to meet utility bills, both the electricity and water companies cut off her supply, leaving her relying on neighbors for water for the horses.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just starting to get myself back together again now,\u201d she said. \u201cWith a lot of financial difficulties. But what can I do? I\u2019m trying.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s got the utilities running again, but still owes thousands of euros. Approaches to companies and institutions for funding have been unsuccessful so far. \u201cMaybe I just don\u2019t know how to ask properly,\u201d Karagianni said.",
      "Running Gentle Carousel single-handedly is taking its toll. \u201cI\u2019m making super-human efforts,\u201d said Karagianni, who at 68 wonders for how long she can go on and is searching for someone to ensure the program\u2019s continuity.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m doing what I can. But I can\u2019t do it alone,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t do it without a team.\u201d",
      "Despite her financial struggles, Karagianni said seeing the horses' effect, particularly on children, makes her determined to continue for as long as she can.",
      "During a visit to the Athens special needs primary school, staff lined up children in wheelchairs so each could spend a few moments with the horses. Some reached out to stroke them; others bent their heads forward over the miniature horses for a kiss.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible, the reactions. It\u2019s like something awakens their senses,\u201d said special needs teacher Eleni Volikaki.",
      "The state-run school, which shares facilities with a private charity for disabled children, ELEPAP, caters to children aged 6-14 with cognitive or mobility problems, or both. Anything that encourages the children to make even small hand gestures, such as reaching out to stroke a horse, \u201cis very important for us. Especially when it\u2019s spontaneous and comes directly from the child and isn\u2019t instigated by us,\u201d Volikaki said.",
      "\u201cWe saw things we didn\u2019t expect. We saw children with autism, or children who are generally afraid of animals, coming very close, letting the (horses) get close to them,\u201d Volikaki said. \u201cAnd we saw \u2026 spontaneous contact that under other circumstances we wouldn\u2019t see.\u201d",
      "The tiny horses don't just enchant children.",
      "In the seaside area of Nea Makri northeast of Athens, residents of an adult psychiatric care home gather to greet Omiros \u2013 Homer in Greek \u2013 a 12-year-old miniature gray and white stallion with a flowing mane and blue eyes.",
      "Some show their excitement at the long-anticipated visit. Others are shyer at first, but nearly all eventually approach Omiros, leading him around the home\u2019s recreation room or simply whispering to him.",
      "The interaction is invaluable, said social worker Alex Krokidas, who heads the staff at the Iasis home.",
      "\u201cIt offers, even if only briefly, the chance to create a bond that isn\u2019t threatening, that has tenderness, quietness,\u201d Krokidas said. \u201cLet\u2019s not forget, these people have faced many difficulties in their lives.\u201d",
      "Meeting Omiros and having a few moments each with him \u201cgives them the opportunity to be a bit calmer, to not feel threatened, to stroke the animal,\u201d Krokidas said. \u201cAll of that is very therapeutic, it is deeply therapeutic.\u201d",
      "Giorgos, one of the residents, initially kept his distance before letting Omiros come close. He leaned his head near the flowing mane.",
      "\u201cHe gave me a beautiful feeling when he was here,\u201d he said after Omiros headed back into the recreation room. \u201cNow that it\u2019s gone, I feel an absence.\u201d",

    "summary": "Social media posts from Luigi Mangione show the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson underwent successful back surgery last year that alleviated debilitating chronic pain",
    "story": [
      "Social media posts from Luigi Mangione show the man suspected of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson underwent successful back surgery last year that alleviated debilitating chronic pain",
      "After Luigi Mangione made the difficult decision to undergo spinal surgery last year for chronic back pain, he became a proponent of the procedure that changed his life for the better.",
      "He repeatedly posted on Reddit about his recovery and offered words of encouragement for people with similar conditions, telling them to push back against doctors who suggested they had to live with pain.",
      "But notably absent from the posts are explicit concerns about corporate greed in the health insurance industry. Those appear to have surfaced only later: in a handwritten note found after Mangione was detained as a suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "That short document references \u201cparasites\u201d in the health care system and laments the power and profits of health insurers, according to law enforcement officials. During his first public words since his arrest in Pennsylvania, Mangione emerged from a patrol car shouting about an \u201cinsult to the intelligence of the American people\u201d while sheriff\u2019s deputies pushed him into a courthouse.",
      "There\u2019s no indication Mangione was ever insured by UnitedHealthcare, a senior New York City police official said in an interview Thursday with NBC New York.",
      "The killing has nonetheless prompted widespread speculation about whether he had a bad personal experience with the health care system. But after his 2023 surgery, Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts suggest he was overwhelmingly pleased with the outcome and finally relieved of chronic pain. He encouraged others not to be frightened by horror stories of surgeries gone bad. He also referenced a backpacking trip to Asia earlier this year.",
      "The 26-year-old Ivy League graduate appears to have stopped posting on social media roughly six months ago, around the time he lost touch with loved ones.",
      "Family and friends expressed shock at news of Mangione\u2019s arrest, but little information has emerged about his recent mental and physical health.",
      "Mangione\u2019s Reddit posts reference a spinal condition called spondylolisthesis, which occurs when a fracture causes a vertebra to slip out of alignment. It can result in severe pain if the bone puts pressure on spinal nerves.",
      "The condition, which can originate in childhood or from an injury, started negatively impacting Mangione\u2019s life in recent years, according to his social media posts.",
      "After earning his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Pennsylvania, he worked at the Santa Monica-based car-buying website TrueCar until 2023 and lived in Hawaii for some time starting in January 2022. During a six-month stay at Surfbreak, a \u201cco-living\u201d space in Honolulu, Mangione\u2019s back pain worsened in part because of a surfing incident.",
      "Josiah Ryan, a spokesperson for the owner and founder of Surfbreak, R.J. Martin, said Mangione had expressed growing concerns about the pain. In addition to missing out on recreational activities and exercise, he was worried about how it could affect romantic relationships.",
      "\u201cThat was definitely a theme in his time there,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t a big complainer. So it wasn\u2019t like he was bringing it up constantly. But the people who knew him knew this was a significant part of his life.\u201d",
      "In July 2023, Mangione wrote in a Reddit post that he had decided to get surgery.",
      "\u201cI got caught in this loop for a year, all the while putting my life on hold in my 20\u2019s and damaging my nerves while I waffled on the decision. I have surgery scheduled in two weeks and I keep wondering why I was so afraid of it,\u201d he wrote.",
      "According to his posts, the operation was a success.",
      "An image posted to an X account linked to Mangione showed what appeared to be an X-ray of a metal rod and multiple screws inserted into his lower spine.",
      "\u201cSurgery was painful for the first couple days, but I was shocked that by day 7 I was on literally zero pain meds,\u201d Mangione posted on Reddit in August 2023. \u201cObviously will be awhile until I get into rigorous activity, but it was way less of a big deal than I had anticipated.\u201d",
      "Medical experts say treating back pain is almost always a challenge.",
      "\u201cIn the gross majority of treatments, surgery is when everything else has failed to provide relief,\u201d said Dr. Jason Pittman, co-director of the Spine Center at Boston\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He said doctors generally try conservative treatments like physical therapy, injections or medications before surgery.",
      "Even people with health insurance can face thousands of dollars in bills from a surgery depending on their deductible and other factors, though it\u2019s unclear whether Mangione experienced any of those issues.",
      "Experiencing chronic back pain can also significantly impact mental health, said Dr. Padma Gulur, a pain specialist with Duke Health.",
      "\u201cIf you have underlying mental health issues \u2014 anxiety, depression \u2014 your pain can be worse because you have way more suffering,\u201d Gulur said. \u201cBut, the second aspect is pain can push you into anxiety and depression.\u201d",
      "Little is known about Mangione\u2019s mental state in recent months, but it appears he was withdrawing from close relationships. Since-deleted posts on X show a friend repeatedly reaching out and getting no response.",
      "His family reported him missing to San Francisco authorities in November, police said.",
      "Earlier, while in college, Mangione posted on Reddit about experiencing severe brain fog and restless sleep.",
      "In a July 2018 post, he said his grades were suffering and he had considered dropping out of school. But ultimately, \u201cstaying in college has at least let me maintain some semblance of normality,\u201d he wrote.",
      "His last Reddit post is dated May 17, but other statements around that time suggest he wasn\u2019t experiencing unexpected complications or renewed back pain. He appears to be advocating for the type of surgery he received months earlier.",
      "He posted in early April about the gear he brought on a two-month backpacking trip through Asia that included some cross-country motorcycling, saying he had found \u201cthe perfect balance between minimalism and practicality.\u201d",
      "In late April, he advised another Reddit user with a back problem to \u201ckeep trying different surgeons\u201d and, if necessary, convey an inability to keep working.",
      "\u201cWe live in a capitalist society,\" he wrote. \"I\u2019ve found that the medical industry responds to these key words far more urgently than you describing unbearable pain and how it\u2019s impacting your quality of life.\u201d",

So that\u2019s possibly why he targeted that company,\u201d said Kenny.",
      "UnitedHealthcare is in the top 20 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization but is not the fifth largest. It is the largest U.S. health insurer.",
      "Mangione remains jailed without bail in Pennsylvania, where he was arrested Monday after being spotted at a McDonald's in the city of Altoona, about 230 miles (about 370 kilometers) west of New York City.

      "Mangione's arrest came five days after the caught-on-camera killing of Thompson outside a Manhattan hotel.",
      "Police say the shooter waited outside the hotel, where the health insurer was holding its investor conference, early on the morning of Dec. 4. He approached Thompson from behind and shot him before fleeing on a bicycle through Central Park.",
      "Mangione is fighting attempts to extradite him back to New York so that he can face a murder charge in Thompson's killing. A hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 30.",
      "The 26-year-old, who police say was found with a \u201c ghost gun \u201d matching shell casings found at the site of the shooting, is charged in Pennsylvania with possession of an unlicensed firearm, forgery and providing false identification to police.",

In posts on social media, Mangione wrote about experiencing severe chronic back pain before undergoing a spinal fusion surgery in 2023. Afterward, he posted that the operation had been a success and that his pain had improved and mobility returned. He urged others to consider the same type of surgery.",
      "On Wednesday, police said investigators are looking at his writings about his health problems and his criticism of corporate America and the U.S. health care system.",

      "In a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine, Donald Trump weighs in on Jan. 6 pardons, immigration issues and world affairs",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump was on the verge of backing a 16-week federal abortion ban earlier this year when aides staged an intervention.",
      "According to Time magazine's cover story on his selection as its 2024 Person of the Year, Trump's aides first raised concerns in mid-March that the abortion cutoff being pushed by some allies would be stricter than existing law in numerous states. It was seen as a potential political liability amid ongoing fallout over the overturning of Roe v. Wade by a conservative majority on the Supreme Court that includes three justices nominated by Trump in his first term.",
      "Trump political director James Blair went to work assembling a slide deck \u2014 eventually titled \u201cHow a national abortion ban will cost Trump the election\" \u2014 that argued a 16-week ban would hurt the Republican candidate in the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the magazine reported.",
      "\u201cAfter flipping through Blair\u2019s presentation\" on a flight to a rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in April, Trump dropped the idea, according to the report. \"So we leave it to the states, right?\" Trump was quoted as saying. He soon released a video articulating that position.",
      "At the time, Trump\u2019s campaign denied that he was considering supporting the 16-week ban, calling it \u201cfake news\u201d and saying Trump planned to \u201cnegotiate a deal\u201d on abortion if elected to the White House.",
      "Here are other highlights from the story and the president-elect's 65-minute interview with the magazine:",
      "Trump reaffirmed his plans to pardon most of those convicted for their actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. \u201cIt\u2019s going to start in the first hour,\u201d he said of the pardons. \u201cMaybe the first nine minutes.\u201d",
      "Trump said he would look at individuals on a \u201ccase-by-case\" basis, but that \u201ca vast majority of them should not be in jail.\u201d",
      "More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the riot that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s 2020 victory. More than 1,000 defendants have pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial of charges, including misdemeanor trespassing offenses, assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "Trump insisted he has the authority to use the military to assist with his promised mass deportations, even though, as his interviewers noted, the Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the use of the military in domestic law enforcement.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t stop the military if it\u2019s an invasion of our country, and I consider it an invasion of our country,\" he said. \u201cI\u2019ll only do what the law allows, but I will go up to the maximum level of what the law allows. And I think in many cases, the sheriffs and law enforcement is going to need help.\"",
      "Trump did not deny that camps would be needed to hold detained migrants as they are processed for deportation.",
      "\u201cWhatever it takes to get them out. I don\u2019t care,\" he said. \u201cI hope we\u2019re not going to need too many because I want to get them out and I don\u2019t want them sitting in camp for the next 20 years.\u201d",
      "Trump told Time he does not plan to restore the policy of separating children from their families to deter border crossings, but he did not rule it out. The practice led to thousands of children being separated from their parents and was condemned around the globe as inhumane.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019ll have to because we will send the whole family back,\u201d he said. \u201cI would much rather deport them together, yes, than separate.\u201d",
      "Trump dismissed the idea that Elon Musk will face conflicts of interest as he takes the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, an advisory group that Trump has selected him to lead. The panel is supposed to find waste and cut regulations, including many that could affect Musk's wide-ranging interests, which include electric cars, rockets and telecommunications.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\" Trump said. \u201cI think that Elon puts the country long before his company. ... He considers this to be his most important project.\"",
      "Trump lowered expectations about his ability to drive down grocery prices.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to bring them down. It\u2019s hard to bring things down once they\u2019re up. You know, it\u2019s very hard. But I think that they will,\u201d he said.",

      "Asked to clarify whether he was committed to preventing the Food and Drug Administration from stripping access to abortion pills, Trump replied, \u201cIt\u2019s always been my commitment.\u201d",
      "But Trump has offered numerous conflicting stances on the issue, including to Time.",
      "Earlier in the interview, he was asked whether he would promise that his FDA would not do anything to limit access to medication abortion or abortion pills. \"We\u2019re going to take a look at all of that,\u201d he said, before calling the prospect \u201cvery unlikely.\u201d",
      "\u201cLook, I\u2019ve stated it very clearly and I just stated it again very clearly. I think it would be highly unlikely. I can\u2019t imagine, but with, you know, we\u2019re looking at everything, but highly unlikely. I guess I could say probably as close to ruling it out as possible, but I don\u2019t want to. I don\u2019t want to do anything now.\u201d",
      "Pressed on whether he would abandon Ukraine in its efforts to stave off Russia's invasion, Trump said he would use U.S. support for Kyiv as leverage against Moscow in negotiating an end to the war.",
      "\u201cI want to reach an agreement,\u201d he said, \u201cand the only way you\u2019re going to reach an agreement is not to abandon.\u201d",
      "Trump would not commit to supporting a two-state solution, with a Palestinian state alongside Israel, as he had previously.",
      "\u201cI support whatever solution we can do to get peace,\" he said. \"There are other ideas other than two state, but I support whatever, whatever is necessary to get not just peace, a lasting peace. It can\u2019t go on where every five years you end up in tragedy. There are other alternatives.\u201d",
      "Asked whether he trusted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he told Time: \u201cI don\u2019t trust anybody.\u201d",
      "Trump would not rule out the possibility of war with Iran during his second term. \u201cAnything can happen. It\u2019s a very volatile situation,\" he said.",
      "Asked if he has spoken to Russian President Vladimir Putin since the Nov. 5 election, Trump continued to play coy: \"I can\u2019t tell you. It\u2019s just inappropriate.\u201d",
      "Trump insisted that his bid to install Matt Gaetz as attorney general \u201dwasn\u2019t blocked. I had the votes (in the Senate) if I needed them, but I had to work very hard.\u201d",
      "When the scope of resistance to the former Republican congressman from Florida became clear, Trump said, \u201cI talked to him, and I said, \u2018You know, Matt, I don\u2019t think this is worth the fight.'\"",
      "Gaetz pulled out amid scrutiny over sex trafficking allegations, and Trump tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi for the Cabinet post.",
      "Trump, who has named anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, did not rule out the possibility of eliminating some childhood vaccinations even though they have been proved safe in extensive studies and real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades and are considered among the most effective public health measures in modern history.",
      "Pressed on whether \u201cgetting rid of some vaccinations\u201d \u2014 neither Trump nor the interviewers specified which ones \u2014 might be part of the plan to improve the health of the country, Trump responded: \u201cIt could if I think it\u2019s dangerous, if I think they are not beneficial, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be very controversial in the end.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think there could be, yeah,\" Trump said of the prospect of others in his family continuing in his footsteps.",

      "There had been nervousness about the impending return of C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n, who once led the feared Gulf cartel in northeastern Mexico before he was arrested and extradited to the United States in 2007.",
      "The U.S. Homeland Security Department confirmed in its social media accounts Monday that C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n had been returned after serving 14 years in U.S. custody, most of his 25-year U.S. prison sentence. He is a Mexican citizen, so presumably he was deported.",
      "A Mexican federal official who was not authorized to be quoted by name said C\u00e1rdenas Guill\u00e9n had immediately been taken into custody in Mexico on drug, organized crime and money-laundering charges.",

      "The image contrasts with the drug lord's fearsome reputation for violence in Mexico.",
      "The former head of the Gulf cartel was known for his brutality. He created the most bloodthirsty gang of hitmen Mexico has ever known, the Zetas, which routinely slaughtered migrants and innocent people.",
      "The 57-year-old native of the border city of Matamoros, Mexico, moved tons of cocaine and made millions of dollars through the Gulf cartel, based in the border cities of Reynosa and Matamoros.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- Authorities in two states in southern Mexico arrested more than 100 local police officers Monday for various abuses and offenses, adding to the long list of police corruption scandals in the country.",
      "In the largest of the two incidents, 92 municipal police officers in the southern state of Chiapas were arrested after they tried to stop state authorities from assuming command of a police surveillance camera office.",
      "Chiapas state prosecutors accused local police officers in the city of Comitan of using the video cameras to inform local groups \u2014 some of which are allied with drug cartels \u2014 about state and federal raids in the area.",
      "Chiapas state police chief \u00d3scar Aparicio Avenda\u00f1o said some of the 92 municipal Comitan police officers drew their guns on state officials trying to take control of the video surveillance office, and forced them out at gunpoint.",
      "The 92 officers were held pending charges of rioting and abuse of authority.",
      "After they were detained, some local residents blocked streets and destroyed or damaged video cameras; about 30 of them were arrested on riot charges.",
      "At issue are local groups that claim to represent farmers in the rural region, but which have often been forced or paid to act in support of drug cartels that have been warring over turf in Chiapas for months.",
      "Having corrupt local police use the surveillance camera network to report the movements of federal troops or state police would be valuable to the farm groups and cartels, which often operate road blockades.",
      "Comitan is located near the border with Guatemala, on a lucrative route for immigrant smuggling.",
      "Chiapas has become so overrun by the Sinaloa cartel and the rival Jalisco drug cartel \u2014 both of which also participate in migrants smuggling and extortion \u2014 that some residents of Mexican towns have been forced to flee to Guatemala for safety.",

      "\u201cThe days are over when they (the gangs) came in, took over, and (said) 'go do this, go block that, go oppose the armed forces,\u201d Ram\u00edrez Aguilar said.

      "However, the cartel problem in Chiapas largely arose under former governor Rutilio Escand\u00f3n, who like Ram\u00edrez Aguilar is also a member of the ruling Morena party. Escand\u00f3n was recently appointed as Mexico's consul in Miami, Florida.",
      "Meanwhile, in the Gulf coast state of Veracruz, state prosecutors said they had arrested 13 state police officers implicated in three cases of forced disappearances. That is an offense in which authorities abduct someone who vanishes without a trace.",

      "After months of deadlock, Israel and Hamas appear to be moving closer toward a ceasefire to end their 14-month war.",
      "Top officials from the U.S., Qatar and Egypt have resumed their mediation efforts in recent weeks and reported greater willingness by the warring sides to wrap up a deal. In a key concession, Hamas officials say they are prepared to show more \u201cflexibility\" on the timing of an Israeli troop withdrawal from Gaza, and Israel\u2019s defense minister, Israel Katz, said Monday that a deal is closer than ever.",
      "Officials on all sides have cautioned that key details must still be worked out. But there is a general sense of optimism that has been lacking for many months.",
      "The changing sentiment appears to be the result of several factors. Israel has inflicted heavy damage on Hamas over the course of the war. The group is more isolated after Hezbollah\u2019s ceasefire with Israel, and Iran, a key backer of both militant groups, has suffered a number of setbacks, highlighted by the downfall of its close ally, Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad.",
      "In the U.S., both the outgoing Biden administration and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump have signaled they want a deal completed before the Jan. 20 inauguration.",
      "According to Egyptian and Hamas officials, the agreement would take place in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of captive Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. Israel says Hamas is holding 100 hostages \u2014 over one-third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Here is a closer look at the emerging deal, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing closed negotiations.",
      "The first phase would last from six to eight weeks. During that time, Hamas would release some 30 hostages \u2013 roughly half of those believed alive. They include three or four dual U.S.-Israeli citizens.",
      "Israel would release hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including as many as 100 who are serving long sentences for alleged involvement in bloody attacks.",
      "The deal calls for a massive increase in aid to Gaza, which has plunged into a humanitarian crisis during the 14-month war. An estimated 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced, in many cases multiple times, and aid workers report severe hunger across the territory.",
      "This is expected to include a reopening of the territory\u2019s Rafah crossing with Egypt, which has been closed since Israeli ground troops invaded the southern border town in May. The crossing is especially important because it is the primary exit point for Palestinians in Gaza who want to travel abroad, and the only one not controlled by Israel.",
      "Mediators say they are considering a return to a 2005 agreement that allowed the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority to operate the crossing with European Union observers. That agreement collapsed when Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 and expelled the Palestinian Authority forces.",
      "During the first phase, Israeli troops would withdraw from some Palestinian population centers, allowing many Palestinians to begin returning home. But Israeli troops wouldn't leave Gaza altogether at this stage. They would remain along the Philadelphi corridor \u2013 a strategic strip of land along Gaza\u2019s border with Egypt.",
      "During the initial ceasefire, the sides would continue negotiations on a permanent agreement, to include an end to the war, full withdrawal of Israeli troops, and release of remaining hostages and bodies held by Hamas.",
      "Talks would begin on final arrangements for Gaza, including who would govern the territory and plans for rebuilding the destruction."

      "LONDON -- An alleged Chinese spy who cultivated close ties with Prince Andrew said Monday he has done \u201cnothing wrong or unlawful\u201d as Britain's government faced questions about what it is doing to thwart security threats from China.",
      "British authorities allege businessman Yang Tengbo \u2014 known only as \u201cH6\u201d until a High Court judge lifted an anonymity order Monday \u2014 was working on behalf of the United Front Work Department, an arm of the Chinese Communist Party that is used to influence foreign entities.",
      "It's the most high-profile case in a series of espionage scandals in recent years that involved suspected or confirmed Chinese intelligence-gathering in Britain's establishment, including in Parliament.",
      "Here's a look at Yang's case:",
      "Yang, 50, also known as Chris Yang, is listed as a director of Hampton Group International, a business consultancy advising U.K.-based companies on their operations in China. He has been photographed with senior U.K. politicians, including former Prime Ministers David Cameron and Theresa May, at events.",
      "Yang is reportedly a key member of Pitch@Palace China, an initiative by Prince Andrew to support entrepreneurs.",
      "Yang worked as a junior civil servant in China before arriving in the U.K. in 2002 to study. He earned a master\u2019s degree in public administration and public policy at the University of York before starting his business.",
      "He was granted the right to live and work in the U.K. for an indefinite period in 2013. Yang told authorities he has spent regular time in Britain and considered it his second home.",
      "Details about Yang's case emerged last week at a special immigration tribunal, which upheld a decision by British authorities to ban Yang from entering the U.K. in 2023. The Home Office said he was believed to have carried out \u201ccovert and deceptive activity\u201d for the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Judges agreed with MI5, Britain's domestic intelligence, that Yang \u201crepresented a risk to the national security\u201d and dismissed his appeal.",
      "The tribunal heard that in 2021, authorities found documents that showed how close Yang was to Prince Andrew, King Charles III's younger brother.",
      "One letter from a senior adviser to Andrew told Yang he should \u201cnever underestimate the strength\" of his relationship with the royal. \u201cOutside of his closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on,\u201d the adviser wrote.",
      "The tribunal said that when Yang was interviewed by immigration authorities he failed to give a full account of his relationship with the prince, which it said had a \u201ccovert and clandestine\u201d element.",
      "Authorities have not made public what information Yang allegedly obtained or was seeking to obtain. But the tribunal cited a 2022 statement by the MI5 director that described the United Front Work Department's aims as buying and exerting influence, amplifying pro-China voices and silencing those critical of the Chinese government's authority.",
      "Andrew has been repeatedly criticized for his links to wealthy foreigners and prompted critics to suggest that those individuals were trying to buy access to the royal family.",
      "Yang strongly denied the espionage claims and said he was a victim of a changing political climate that had seen a rise in tensions between Britain and China.",
      "\u201cI have done nothing wrong or unlawful,\" he said in a statement. \"The widespread description of me as a \u2018spy\u2019 is entirely untrue.\u201d",
      "Andrew's office said the royal met Yang \u201cthrough official channels\u201d and nothing of a sensitive nature was ever discussed.",
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he is concerned about the challenge posed by China, but stood by his government's strategy of engagement and cooperation with Beijing.",
      "Starmer, who took office this summer, has sought to repair frayed ties and in November became the first British leader to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2018.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith, a leading critic of Beijing, said that glosses over the clear threat China poses. Yang was already a known member of China's United Front Work Department, he told Parliament, and should not have been able to gain access to the royal family without scrutiny.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that there are many, many more involved in exactly this kind of espionage that\u2019s taking place,\u201d he said.",
      "In 2022 British intelligence officials warned politicians that Christine Lee, a British-Chinese lawyer, had been seeking to improperly influence members of Parliament for years. A parliamentary researcher was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of providing sensitive information to China.",

      "Hungary holds the EU\u2019s rotating presidency until the end of the month, when Poland takes over. Over the past year it has routinely blocked joint moves against Russia or in support of Ukraine, complicating procedures.",

      "The EU granted Georgia candidate status for membership in December 2023 but put the accession bid on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a \u201cforeign influence\u201d law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms."

    "story": [
      "A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby says he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution\u2019s leading expert changed his opinion on how three infants died",
      "LONDON -- A lawyer for convicted British killer nurse Lucy Letby said Monday that he plans to ask an appeals court to re-examine her convictions after the prosecution's leading expert changed his opinion on how three babies died.",
      "Dr. Dewi Evans's testimony is no longer credible after he reversed his opinion that Letby killed three infants by injecting air down a nasal gastric tube, attorney Mark McDonald said.",
      "\u201cThe defense will argue that Dr. Evans is not a reliable expert, and given that he was the lead expert for the prosecution, we say that all the convictions are not safe,\u201d McDonald said.",
      "Letby, 34, is serving multiple life sentences with no chance of release after being convicted of murdering seven babies and trying to murder seven others while working as a neonatal nurse at the Countess of Chester Hospital in northwestern England between June 2015 and June 2016.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service defended the verdicts.",
      "\u201cTwo juries and three appeal court judges have reviewed a multitude of different strands of evidence against Lucy Letby,\u201d a CPS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cIn May, the Court of Appeal dismissed Letby\u2019s leave to appeal on all grounds \u2014 rejecting her argument that expert prosecution evidence was flawed.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said at trial that Letby's methods left little trace and included injecting air into their bloodstreams, poisoning them with insulin and interfering with breathing tubes. Prosecutors said she was a \u201cconstant malevolent presence\" and was alone on duty in the neonatal unit when the children collapsed or died.",
      "Letby, who testified at two trials that she never harmed a child, has stood by her claims of innocence.",
      "Experts said it is unusual to ask the Court of Appeal to reopen its previous decision to reject a case and would require convincing evidence to succeed.",
      "\u201cIt is vanishingly rare for a lead expert witness in a criminal case to \u2018change his mind\u2019 on key evidence,\" said defense lawyer Sean Caulfield, who is not involved in the case. \u201cIt is also rare for there to be a bid to reopen an appeal after it has already been refused by the Court of Appeal. I have never seen these two things happen in unison during my 20-year plus career. It is quite an astonishing turn of events.\"",
      "McDonald said 15 medical experts around the world are reviewing trial evidence.",
      "An inquiry currently underway to examine failures by the hospital to recognize why babies were dying and why they took so long to stop Letby opened in September against a backdrop of experts and others who have questioned evidence used against Letby.",
      "A group of scientists, doctors and legal experts that independently reviewed scientific evidence from Letby\u2019s trial warned Britain\u2019s ministers of health and justice that legal systems were \u201cparticularly vulnerable to errors\u201d when dealing with technical matters, \u201cespecially in cases involving statistical anomalies in health care settings.\u201d",
      "Evans gave his new opinions on the death of infants identified in court as Baby C, Baby I and Baby P in a signed response to a Channel 5 documentary, McDonald said.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m sure Dr. Evans is still going to say that Lucy Letby is guilty and he has a different view or different hypothesis in relation to it,\" McDonald said. \u201cBut the cause of death that was before the Court of Appeal is different now, according to Dr. Evans, and I think that is a profound issue that needs to be relooked at.\u201d",
      "Evans has not yet responded to a request for comment following McDonald's news conference.",
      "Additionally, two neonatologists working with the defense said there were medical reasons Baby C and Baby O became ill and could not be resuscitated, McDonald said.",

      "How do you solve a problem like Prince Andrew",
      "LONDON -- How do you solve a problem like Prince Andrew?",
      "That\u2019s the question facing King Charles III as the drama surrounding his 64-year-old brother roils Britain and the monarchy once again.",
      "In the latest episode, a Chinese businessman has been barred from the U.K. because of concerns he cultivated links with Andrew in an alleged effort to influence British elites on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party. The man, identified Monday as Yang Tengbo, said he wasn't involved in espionage and had \u201cdone nothing wrong or unlawful.\u201d",
      "The allegations represent the most high-profile example to date of a threat intelligence officials have repeatedly warned about: China\u2019s increasing efforts to secretly influence politicians and other members of the British establishment to support the country\u2019s expansionist policies.",
      "But the story also made news because it involves Andrew, once second-in-line to the British throne but now a constant source of tabloid fodder because of his money woes and links to questionable characters, including the late American financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Queen Elizabeth II stripped Andrew of his royal duties and charity roles, but the unflattering headlines kept coming. More recently, Charles has tried to persuade his brother to cut his expenses by leaving the sprawling royal estate he occupies west of London and moving to a cottage inside the security perimeter of Windsor Castle. But Andrew remains ensconced at the 30-room Royal Lodge.",
      "The king needs to take more aggressive action to keep Andrew out of the public eye, such as barring him from processions and other royal events, said Ed Owens, author of \u201cAfter Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?\u2019\u2019",
      "While Andrew said in a statement that nothing sensitive was ever discussed and that he ceased contact with the Chinese businessman as soon as concerns were raised, his constant brushes with scandal tarnish the work of the royal family, Owens said.",
      "\u201cAndrew is toxic and he is very much damaged goods,\u201d he added. \u201cHe can only, through his behavior, further undermine the reputation of the monarchy. It\u2019s in the king\u2019s best interest, it\u2019s in the best interests of the future of the monarchy, for Andrew to take a step back.\u201d",
      "Britain\u2019s most prominent anti-monarchy group used the latest scandal to call for a parliamentary inquiry into alleged royal corruption.",
      "\u201cWhen a Chinese spy befriends a royal, they want access to the British state. We must know if the royals have given them what they want,\u201d said Graham Smith, leader of Republic, which seeks to replace the monarchy with an elected head of state.",
      "Andrew has become a cautionary tale about the temptations and pitfalls of modern royalty.",
      "When Andrew was born he was second in line to the throne, the proverbial spare who was there to step in if disaster struck the heir, his brother Charles. But after Charles married, Andrew\u2019s position dropped with every new child and grandchild. He now stands at eighth place in the royal pecking order.",
      "While other senior royals spend much of their time opening recreation centers and meeting community leaders on behalf of their more exalted relations, Andrew initially took on bigger tasks.",
      "After 22 years in the Royal Navy, including combat operations as a helicopter pilot during the Falklands War, Andrew was named Britain\u2019s special representative for international trade and investment in 2001.",
      "But he was forced to step down in 2011 amid growing concern about his friendship with Epstein, who had been sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to soliciting a minor for prostitution.",
      "Andrew had also been criticized for meeting with the son of Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi and the son-in-law of ousted Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali.",
      "Even before that, some members of Parliament had raised concerns about the sale of Andrew\u2019s former home, Sunninghill Park, to a son-in-law of former Kazakh ruler Nursultan Nazarbayev in 2007. The buyer allegedly paid 15 million pounds ($19 million) \u2014 3 million pounds more than the asking price.",
      "But Andrew\u2019s links to Epstein have been his biggest problem.",
      "Questions about the relationship resurfaced after Epstein was again arrested on sex trafficking charges in 2019. In an effort to silence criticism, Andrew gave a disastrous interview to the BBC\u2019s Newsnight program in which he tried to explain away his contacts with Epstein and failed to show empathy for victims.",
      "Amid the backlash, Andrew announced on Nov. 20, 2019, that he was stepping away from royal duties \u201cfor the foreseeable future.\u201d In a statement, he called his association with Epstein \u201ca major disruption to my family\u2019s work.\u201d",
      "But that didn\u2019t end the scandal.",
      "In August 2021, one of Epstein\u2019s victims sued Andrew in a New York cour t, alleging that the prince had sex with her when she was underage. Andrew denied the allegations, but he was stripped of all military affiliations and royal charity work as the case moved through the legal process.",
      "Andrew ultimately settled the case for an undisclosed sum, with a joint statement indicating the prince would make a \u201csubstantial donation\u201d to a victims\u2019 rights charity. British newspapers reported amounts for the settlement ranged from $6 million to $16 million.",
      "Even now, Andrew\u2019s interview haunts the prince and the royal family. It resurfaced earlier this year in the Netflix movie \u201cScoop,\u201d reminding a worldwide audience of his missteps.",
      "\u201cHe has consistently used his privileged position and his power to cozy up to convicted sex offenders, Chinese spies \u2014 in pursuit of his own interests, whether it\u2019s about expanding his own influence or indeed extending his own business interests,\u2019\u2019 Owens said. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem here, that he\u2019s used the position given to him by birth to seek out these opportunities.\u201d"

      "DAMASCUS -- Ousted Syrian leader Bashar Assad said Monday he wanted to stay in the country after rebels captured the capital, but the Russian military evacuated him from their base in western Syria after it came under attack.",
      "They were Assad's first public comments since he was overthrown by insurgent groups just over a week ago following a swift offensive that has shaken up the country's alliances and led to celebrations in a nation long stifled by civil war.",
      "Meanwhile, a spokesman for the new transitional government told The Associated Press that the new Syria will be inclusive and open to the world.",
      "Assad said on Facebook that he left Damascus on the morning of Dec. 8, hours after insurgents stormed the capital. He said he left in coordination with Russian allies to their Hmeimim air base in the coastal province of Latakia, where he had planned to keep fighting.",
      "But after the Russian base came under attack by drones, he said, the Russians decided to move him that night to Russia.",
      "\u201cAt no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge nor was such proposal made by any individual or party,\u201d Assad said in the English text of his statement. \u201cThe only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught.\u201d",
      "In Damascus, residents dismissed Assda's comments and some said he had abandoned Syria's people long ago.",
      "\u201cIs he going to run away from us? He still won\u2019t be able to run away from God,\u201d said one resident, Moataz al-Ahmed, as children stepped on a fallen statue of Assad's father, Hafez, who had begun the family's half-century rule.",

      "He also called on the U.S. and other countries to reconsider the designation of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham \u2014 the main rebel group and a former al-Qaida affiliate \u2014 as a terrorist organization, calling it \u201cnot right and not accurate\u201d designation.",
      "Already, the U.S. has said its officials have been in direct contact with the group.",
      "Syria is home to multiple ethnic and religious communities, often pitted against each other by Assad\u2019s state and years of war. Many of them fear the possibility that Sunni Islamist extremists will take over.",
      "The new leadership also has been in contact with the U.S. to return American citizen Travis Timmerman, who was among the prisoners released from government detention centers when Assad fell, Arnaout said.",
      "\u201cThere are political contacts at the highest levels in a way that benefits the Syrian people and that strengthen the current administration,\u201d he said.",
      "Asked whether the new government's security forces would cooperate with the U.S. to combat remaining militants with the Islamic State group, Arnaout said Syrian factions have ousted and rejected IS and the group no longer has a significant presence in the country.",
      "U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria have been the main U.S. ally in fighting IS and oversee detention centers housing IS militants. However, the future of the Kurds and the semi-autonomous region they control is unclear in the country's new post-Assad order. Clashes over territory have taken place in some areas between Kurdish forces and the armed groups that overthrew Assad.",
      "Arnaout said the Kurds are part of the Syrian people and their rights will be protected. However, he said the new government will not accept that any part of Syria be outside of Damascus' control.",
      "\u201cKurds are one of the components of the Syrian people and we are very keen that this group has its rights protected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe social fabric in Syria is a source of strength and not weakness. But we affirm that we don\u2019t any part of Syria to be separated.\u201d",

      "Russia's state media say an estimated 3,700 tons of low-grade fuel oil has spilled into the Kerch Strait after two Russian ships were seriously damaged by stormy weather",
      "MOSCOW -- An estimated 3,700 tons of low-grade fuel oil had spilled into the Kerch Strait after two Russian ships were seriously damaged by stormy weather, Russian state media reported Monday.",
      "The two ships, the Volgoneft 239 and the Volgoneft 212, were transporting roughly 9,200 tons of mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Social media footage from the scene showed a black liquid rising among the waves.",
      "Preliminary estimates say that 3,700 tons of mazut leaked into the sea, Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti reported, citing an unnamed source. In a statement, the leader of Russia\u2019s nearby Krasnodar region, Gov. Veniamin Kondratev, said that the oil had not yet reached the shore.",
      "An emergency rescue operation was launched Sunday after the Volgoneft-212 tanker ran aground and had its bow torn away in storm conditions, Russia\u2019s Emergency Situations Ministry said. One sailor in the 13-man crew died, officials said.",
      "A second tanker, the Volgoneft-239, was also left damaged and adrift with 14 crewmembers on board. It later ran aground 80 meters from shore, close to the port of Taman in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region, from where the sailors were later rescued.",
      "Russian officials confirmed the oil spill Sunday, but said that experts were still working to assess its full impact and extent.",
      "In a statement, Greenpeace Ukraine said they will monitor the situation. The charity has had no presence in Russia since 2023, when it was designated as an \u201cundesirable organization\u201d by the Russian government.",
      "\u201cAny oil or petrochemical spill in these waters has the potential to be serious,\u201d said Dr. Paul Johnston, head of Greenpeace Research Laboratories, based at the University of Exeter in the U.K.)",
      "\u201cIt is likely to be driven by prevailing wind and currents and in the current weather conditions (it) is likely to be extremely difficult to contain. If it is driven ashore, then it will cause fouling of the shoreline which will be extremely difficult to clean up.\u201d",
      "The Kerch Strait separates the Russian-occupied Crimean Peninsula from Russia and is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the Sea of Azov to the Black Sea.",
      "It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months.",
      "Mykhailo Podolyak, an advisor to the head of the office of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, described the oil spill as a \u201clarge-scale environmental disaster\u201d of the war and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers.",

    "story": [
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing the biggest test of his political career following the resignation of Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers",
      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced the biggest test of his political career after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, resigned from the Cabinet on Monday.",
      "The stunning move raised questions about how much longer the prime minister of nearly 10 years \u2014 whose popularity has plummeted due to concerns about inflation and immigration \u2014 can stay on as his administration scrambles to deal with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Trudeau swiftly named longtime ally and friend Dominic LeBlanc, the pubic safety minister who recently joined him at dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, to replace Freeland.",
      "After being sworn in, LeBlanc told reporters he and Trudeau are focused on the cost of living facing Canadians and on finding common ground with Trump on border security and economic issues.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very confident that we can continue to do the necessary work,\u201d LeBlanc said.",
      "Jagmeet Singh, leader of the opposition New Democratic Party which Trudeau\u2019s ruling Liberals have relied upon to stay in power, called for him to resign earlier Monday.",
      "\u201cHe has to go,\u201d NDP leader Singh said.",
      "The main opposition Conservatives have not called for Trudeau\u2019s resignation but demand an election.",
      "Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said Trudeau had told her on Friday he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter that the only \u201chonest and viable path\u201d was to leave the Cabinet.",
      "\u201cFor the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,\u201d Freeland said.",
      "Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and 250 Canadian dollar ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said Canada is dealing with Trump's threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew \u201ccostly political gimmicks\" it can \u201cill afford.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur country is facing a grave challenge,\u201d Freeland said in her letter. \u201cThat means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.\u201d",
      "A Liberal party official said Freeland was offered a position as minister in charge of Canada-U.S. relations without portfolio and without a department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the position would have been in name only and wouldn't have come with any of the tools Freeland previously had when she negotiated trade with the United States.",
      "Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, had been set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump's tariffs. Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless the neighbors stem the numbers of migrants and drugs.",
      "The statement shows a much larger deficit than expected for the fiscal year and more than a billion for border security.",
      "Trudeau has said he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but some party members have said they don't want him to run for a fourth term, and Freeland's departure was a huge blow.",
      "Trudeau met with his lawmakers on Monday evening. Later, most of them brushed past reporters, declining to say what was said in the meeting.",
      "Liberal lawmaker Chad Collins said they were \u201cnot united.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s still a number of our members that want a change in leadership. I\u2019m one of them,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the only path forward for us is to choose a new leader.\u201d",
      "No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms.",
      "The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one other major party in Parliament, because they don\u2019t hold an outright majority themselves. If NDP pulls support, an election can be held at any time.",
      "Singh said all options are on the table.",
      "\u201cMr. Trudeau\u2019s government is over,\u201d Opposition Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said. \u201cHe must acknowledge that and act accordingly. The departure of his most important ally, his finance minister, is the end of this government.\u201d",
      "Trudeau channeled the star power of his father, late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, in 2015, when he reasserted the country\u2019s liberal identity after almost a decade of Conservative Party rule.",
      "But Canadians are now frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues, including immigration increases following the country\u2019s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cAs a country we have to project strength,\u201d Ontario Premier Doug Ford said. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos right now up in Ottawa.\u201d",
      "Justin Trudeau\u2019s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change.",
      "Freeland also said in her letter that Canadians \u201cknow when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end.\"",
      "Separately, Trudeau has been trying to recruit Mark Carney, the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada, to join his government. Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. It wasn't immediately clear if Carney has agreed to join Trudeau's Cabinet.",
      "\u201cFreeland was not only finance minister but also deputy prime minister and, until a couple of years ago, was seen as Trudeau\u2019s heir as Liberal leader and prime minister,\u201d said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto.",
      "Wiseman said leaks from the prime minister\u2019s office suggest that Freeland was a poor communicator.",
      "\u201cThere was talk about her becoming foreign minister again and that would have been a good fit for her, but the stab in the back from the prime minister's office cast the die,\u201d Wiseman said.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, called Freeland's resignation a political earthquake.",
      "\u201cThis is clearly a minority government on life support but, until now, the (opposition) NDP has rejected calls to pull the plug on it,\" B\u00e9land said. It\u2019s hard to know whether this resignation will force the NDP to rethink its strategy.\u201d"

      "The U.S. Census Bureau is changing how it counts immigrants in annual estimates by including more people who were admitted for humanitarian, and often temporary, reasons.",
      "The change is being made in an effort to better reflect population shifts this decade, officials said Monday. Population estimates, including immigration, are due to be released Thursday showing how the populations of the United States and the 50 states changed this year. However, the new approach to counting immigrants will only be reflected nationally.",

The Census Bureau estimated 1.1 million immigrants entered the United States in 2023, while the Congressional Budget Office's estimate was 3.3 million people.",
      "The group of people being included in the international migration estimates are those who enter the country through humanitarian parole, which has been granted for seven decades by Republican and Democratic presidential administrations to people unable to use standard immigration routes because of time pressure or their government\u2019s poor relations with the U.S. The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based research organization, said last week that more than 5.8 million people were admitted under various humanitarian policies from 2021 to 2024.",

The population estimates provide the official population counts each year between the once-a-decade census for the United States, the 50 states, counties and metro areas.

      "New Jersey lawmakers are considering changing the law to make gambling by people under the age of 21 no longer punishable under criminal law, making it subject to a fine.",
      "It also would impose fines on anyone helping an underage person gamble in New Jersey.",
      "The bill changes the penalties for underage gambling from that of a disorderly persons offense to a civil offense. Fines would be $500 for a first offense, $1,000 for a second offense, and $2,000 for any subsequent offenses.",
      "The money would be used for prevention, education, and treatment programs for compulsive gambling, such as those provided by the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.",
      "\u201cThe concern I had initially was about reducing the severity of the punishment,\u201d said Assemblyman Don Guardian, a Republican former mayor of Atlantic City. \u201cBut the fact that all the money will go to problem gambling treatment programs changed my mind.\u201d",
      "Figures on underage gambling cases were not immediately available Thursday. But numerous people involved in gambling treatment and recovery say a growing number of young people are becoming involved in gambling, particularly sports betting as the activity spreads around the country.",

      "The continuing surge in internet gambling represents a trend that has been present in New Jersey for several years now.

      "Borgata won a combined $122.6 million in November, up over 25% from a year earlier.

      "Former talk show host Carlos Watson has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in the federal financial conspiracy case surrounding his once-buzzy Ozy Media",
      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax.",
      "There's no parallel between faking blood test results and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "Only one of those investors spoke at the sentencing \u2014 Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "TikTok is asking the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agrees to sell it",
      "WASHINGTON -- TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it.",
      "Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the law's Jan. 19 deadline. A similar plea was filed by content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikTok's more than 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "\u201cA modest delay in enforcing the Act will create breathing room for this Court to conduct an orderly review and the new Administration to evaluate this matter \u2014 before this vital channel for Americans to communicate with their fellow citizens and the world is closed,\u201d lawyers for the companies told the Supreme Court.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a ban but then pledged during the campaign to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d said his administration would take a look at the situation.",
      "\u201cAs you know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His campaign saw the platform as a way to reach younger, less politically engaged voters.",
      "Trump was meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, according to two people familiar with the president-elect\u2019s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.",
      "The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.",
      "On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.",
      "The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.",
      "Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect Jan. 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.",
      "It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that Trump's Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences. Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.",
      "The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that the justices can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues. They also could quickly schedule arguments and try to render a decision by Jan. 19.",
      "On the other hand, the high court could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.",
      "With that last prospect in mind, the companies' lawyers asked for a ruling on their emergency request by Jan. 6 because they'd need the time \u201cto coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States.\u201d",
      "The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April.",

      "Julie Scelfo started MAMA \u2014 Mothers Against Media Addiction \u2014 earlier this year to help parents fight back against the harms of social media on children. A former journalist, Scelfo says she was inspired to take action after reporting on the youth mental health crisis and how screens and social media are affecting young people\u2019s lives.",
      "The group has 28 chapters in 17 states, with waitlists to start other chapters. Scelfo says the group wants to establish chapters in every state, provide parent education about technology, \u201censure the school day remains smart-phone-free for students and overcome the \u201dinertia in our state capitals and Congress so technology is safeguarded like other consumer products.\"",
      "Scelfo spoke with The Associated Press recently about her work with MAMA, as well as a new Australian law banning children under 16 from using social media. The Q&A has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "QUESTION: What are the biggest issues you hear from parents about technology, anything new that hasn\u2019t been talked about as much?",
      "I\u2019m not sure it hasn\u2019t been talked about, but what I hear the most from parents is that they are extremely stressed about the ubiquity of technology in their children\u2019s lives and they don\u2019t know what to do about it. Whether it\u2019s the massive social pressure to get kids their own phones, or the fact that kindergartners are handed tablets on their first day of school, it can feel almost impossible for parents to do what they intrinsically know is better for their kids \u2014 which is to be outside in the world as much as possible and not parked in front of a screen. But parents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children off screens and keeping them safe online because the problems are baked into society and into the design of the products.",
      "Parents and kids face a polycrisis \u2014 multiple crises happening at the same time which creates an effect even more devastating than each one would be individually. At a time when children should be building their social skills and attention span, they are increasingly interacting with the world through technology that can impede the development of both \u2013 and on platforms without adequate safeguards. Social media companies relentlessly target our kids with hidden algorithms that exploit their emotions for profit, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a real understanding of just how pervasive that exploitation is.",
      "Q: Is Australia\u2019s ban on social media for kids under 16 the right move by a government? Why/why not?",
      "Australia\u2019s social media ban for children under 16 puts the responsibility of compliance where it should be \u2014 on tech platforms, not parents. With more than half of teenagers spending nearly five hours a day on social media platforms and our heart-breaking national youth mental health crisis, it\u2019s unconscionable that governments around the world, including here in the U.S., have failed to pass meaningful social media regulation since the days when AOL still distributed CD-ROMs by snail mail.",
      "Much like the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) would do here in the U.S, Australia\u2019s ban represents a crucial first break in the long-standing logjam on any type of internet regulation and I applaud Australia\u2019s legislators and Prime Minister Albanese for having the courage to stand up to Big Tech.",
      "Big Tech is personalizing content to pull our kids into a world where addiction, anxiety, and even depression are side effects. To keep them on the app longer, children are shown more and more extreme content, leveraging the mountains of data they are collecting on our kids, with no common-sense safeguards or basic protections every parent expects. They are making billions while having the nerve to say it\u2019s the parents\u2019 job to make their products safe for our kids? It\u2019s time for governments to step in and force Beg Tech to take responsibility for the effects of their products. Big Tech has spent more than $51 million this year alone to prevent KOSA from passing.",
      "Q: What are the reasons that teens should wait until 16 to be on social media?",
      "A: Today\u2019s youth spend nearly 9 hours on screens daily and it\u2019s not healthy or safe for their hearts and minds. For example, Meta in September acknowledged taking action on 12 million pieces of suicide and self-harm content on Facebook and Instagram this year \u2014 just between April and June. Our kids\u2019 compulsion to check their phones is exposing them to unsafe content and displacing critical, real-world experiences they need to properly develop socially, emotionally and academically.",
      "Q: Won\u2019t kids just get around the restrictions, as they always do?",
      "A: Every other industry is safeguarded. From toys to food to buildings to cars, we have regulations in place to keep children safe. Why should social media products be any different? Kids may try to get around the restrictions \u2014 just like they do for alcohol, tobacco or drugs \u2014 but nobody is saying that because they try, we should give them unfettered access to them. Parents cannot possibly bear the entire responsibility of keeping children safe online, because the problems are baked into the design of the products, and so we need policies that hold Big Tech accountable for ensuring their products are safe.",
      "Q: What is your ultimate goal with MAMA?",
      "A: Just like Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the genesis of this movement is fury and anger at the injustice of young people being robbed of their lives just because they happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong time.",
      "I want to direct that energy into cultural change \u2014 we can\u2019t continue to tout the benefits of technology without having an open and real-time discussion about its significant, and widespread harms and without ensuring that powerful corporations, just like Big Tobacco, are forced to make their products as safe as possible for humans.",
      "The ultimate goal for MAMA is to put tech products in their place: as powerful, and often helpful tools - but just a part of human life, not the center of it."

      "DETROIT -- Starting in September of 2027, all new passenger vehicles in the U.S. will have to sound a warning if rear-seat passengers don't buckle up.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Monday that it finalized the rule, which also requires enhanced warnings when front seat belts aren't fastened.",
      "The agency estimates that the new rule will save 50 lives per year and prevent 500 injuries when fully in effect, according to a statement.",
      "The new rule will apply to passenger cars, trucks, buses except for school buses, and multipurpose vehicles weighing up to 10,000 pounds.",
      "Before the rule, seat belt warnings were required only for the driver's seat. Under the new rule, outboard front-seat passengers also must get a warning if they don't fasten their belts. Front-center seats will not get a warning because NHTSA found that it wouldn't be cost effective. The agency said most vehicles already have warnings for the outboard passenger seats.",
      "The rule also lengthens the duration of audio and visual warnings for the driver's seat. The front-seat rules are effective starting Sept. 1 of 2026.",
      "Rear passengers consistently use seat belts at a lower rate than front passengers, the agency says. In 2022, front belt use was just under 92%, while rear use dropped to about 82%. About half of automobile passengers who died in crashes two years ago weren\u2019t wearing belts, according to NHTSA data.",

      "Florida Atlantic\u2019s board of trustees is expected to approve a $22.5 million, 15-year deal that would give Flagler Credit Union the naming rights to the school\u2019s football stadium",
      "Florida Atlantic's board of trustees is expected to approve a $22.5 million, 15-year deal that would give Flagler Credit Union the naming rights to the school's football stadium.",
      "The deal \u2014 both in terms of total and average value \u2014 would be the biggest publicly known naming rights agreement for any school in the American Athletic Conference currently with an on-campus stadium.",
      "The board will hold a special meeting Tuesday with the naming rights item on its agenda, with FAU athletic director Brian White expected to present the plan for approval. FAU's athletic department has scheduled a news conference for a \u201csignificant announcement\u201d following the end of the meeting, without specifying a reason.",
      "If approved, the stadium would be called Flagler Credit Union Stadium. The field will remain named for Howard Schnellenberger, who was FAU's first coach and the person who essentially built the program from scratch starting in the late 1990s.",
      "It is the second major announcement for FAU football this month. On Dec. 2, the Owls hired Zach Kittley \u2014 most recently the Texas Tech offensive coordinator for the last three seasons \u2014 as their new head coach, giving him a $6 million, five-year deal.",
      "Part of the sponsorship agreement will also give the credit union some multi-media rights for football, men\u2019s basketball and women\u2019s basketball. FAU will cover the first $150,000 of costs related to new signage bearing the stadium's new name. All additional costs from that point will be split between the school and the sponsor.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 13:14:30 -0500",
    "summary": "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
      "At least two internal Amazon studies found a link between how quickly the online retailer's warehouse workers perform tasks and workplace injuries, but the company rejected many safety recommendations out of concern the proposed changes might reduce productivity, according to a U.S. Senate committee report.",
      "The 160-page review issued Sunday night was compiled by the Democratic majority staff of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The report is the final product of a probe into Amazon\u2019s warehouse safety practices that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders initiated last year.",
      "The Vermont independent, a frequent critic of Amazon who chairs the panel, released an interim report in July that featured some findings from the investigation. The final report, which was mostly based on interviews with nearly 500 former and current Amazon workers, included more details, such as the two internal studies and the reactions they received inside the company.",
      "Amazon pushed back on the findings Monday, saying in a blog post that Sanders \u201ccontinues to mislead the American public\u201d about the company's safety practices and that the report was \u201cwrong on the facts and features selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn\u2019t grounded in reality.\"",
      "The Senate report said Amazon launched an internal study in 2021 to determine the maximum number of times a warehouse worker could perform the same physical tasks without increased risk of harm and potentially developing musculoskeletal disorders.",
      "The team conducting the Amazon study, known as Project Elderwand, focused on workers who picked items from robotic shelf units. The study concluded that the \u201clikelihood of back injury increases\" along with the number of items picked and identified an upper limit on repetitive movements - 1,940 - per 10-hour shift, the report said.",
      "The study recommended using software to implement breaks \u201caccording to each worker's rate.\u201d It suggested expanding an existing Amazon program that recommended \u201cmicrobreaks\u201d and making them mandatory for employees who worked above the maximum pace.",
      "The team stated that the success of a mini pilot program to test out its idea would be conditional on \u201cany negative impact to the (workers) or customer experience,\u201d according to documents cited in the committee report.",
      "Ultimately, Amazon did not make changes to reduce repetitive worker movements, the report said. The company told the Senate committee it chose not to do so due to \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d involving the proposed software program, the report said.",
      "Amazon also said in its blog post that the Project Elderwand pilot program showed the study team's suggested intervention was \u201cineffective.\"",
      "Amazon previously had undertaken another study, known as Project Soteria, in 2020 to identify risk factors for injuries and recommend policy changes that would improve worker safety. The multi-team initiative studied two policies Amazon implemented temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic - giving workers more time off and pausing disciplinary measures \u201cfor workers who failed to meet speed requirements,\u201d the report said.",
      "The study found that both policies lowered injury risks and asked for their permanent adoption.",
      "But company leaders denied the request, saying it might \u201cnegatively impact\u201d productivity, according to Amazon documents cited in the Senate committee report. Amazon leaders also changed the focus of the Project Soteria study by telling the people conducting the review to provide recommendations on how to improve productivity without worsening worker injuries, the report said.",
      "Amazon disputed the report's characterization of the events.",
      "\u201cProject Soteria is an example of this type of team evaluation, where one team explored whether there\u2019s a causal link between pace of work and injuries and another team evaluated the methodology and findings and determined they weren\u2019t valid,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a written statement.",
      "Nantel also said that information about Project Soteria was raised in a Washington state worker safety case in which Amazon was accused of four safety violations. A judge assigned to the case ruled in Amazon's favor in July. Regulators are appealing the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the senator chose to ignore the facts and all of this context,\u201d Nantel said.",
      "The Senate committee report also alleged that Amazon manipulates its workplace injury data to portray its warehouses as safer than they are, an allegation the company disputed.",
      "Amazon said it produced \u201cthousands of pages of information and data\u201d for the committee. The majority staff, however, said the company failed to produce documents on the connection between the pace of work and injuries.",
      "The author's of the committee report said they learned about the two internal studies from the Washington worker safety case, not Amazon. Once the committee staff members identified the studies by name, they reached out to the company, which ultimately provided the individual documents."

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. -- In a freewheeling press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club, President-elect Donald Trump said Monday he would consider pardoning embattled New York Mayor Eric Adams, declared the country was \u201cnot going to lose\" the polio vaccine and weighed in on the flurry of drone sightings over New Jersey.",
      "Holding court with reporters for the first time since he won the election and secured a second term, Trump also called on the Biden administration to stop selling off unused portions of southern border wall, threatening legal action.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars more on building the same wall we already have,\u201d he railed. \u201cIt\u2019s almost a criminal act.\u201d",
      "Trump's performance Monday underscored how he has already forced his return to the center of the national political conversation, weeks before he is set to return to the Oval Office. The session was notably less combative than some of the more heated exchanges he held with reporters during the campaign. Trump, looking relaxed at the lectern, joked with those he recognized and talked about how much easier the transition has been than after his first election.",
      "\u201cThe first time everybody was fighting me,\u201d he said. \u201cThis time everyone wants to be my friend.\u201d",
      "After spending most of the last few weeks mostly behind closed doors at Mar-a-Lago, Trump used the session to test-drive policy ideas, attack his enemies and issue warnings of what is to come.",
      "That included the threat of a lawsuit against famed Iowa pollster Ann Selzer, whose final survey before the election badly underestimated Trump's support in the state, which he won.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion it was fraud and election interference,\" Trump claimed of the survey. Selzer, who declined to comment, announced that she would retire her polling operation last month but said she had decided to before the election.",
      "ABC News announced over the weekend that had it agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump's presidential library to settle a defamation lawsuit he had filed over anchor George Stephanopoulos\u2019 inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping a writer.",
      "Continuing his threats of legal action, Trump railed Monday against the Biden administration over the border wall material sales, saying he has spoken to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and other Texas officials about a potential restraining order.",
      "Congress last year required the Biden administration to dispose of the unused border wall pieces. The measure, included in the massive National Defense Authorization Act, allows for the sale or donation of the items to states on the southern border, providing they are used to refurbish existing barriers, not install new ones. Congress also directed the Pentagon to account for storage costs for the border wall material while it has gone unused.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m asking today, Joe Biden, to please stop selling the wall,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The Department of Defense, however, said that further sales can't be blocked because all the excess border wall material has already been distributed. Most was provided to other federal agencies and state governments, as required by defense legislation signed on Dec. 22, 2023. The rest was sold to GovPlanet, which buys and auctions off government surplus.",
      "While Trump described the handover between Biden and his incoming team as \u201ca friendly transition,\u201d he also took issue with efforts to allow some members of the federal workforce to continue working from home. Trump said that if government workers don\u2019t come back into the office under him, they will be dismissed.",
      "Trump also weighed in on Adams, who is facing federal fraud and corruption charges. Asked whether he would consider pardoning Adams, Trump said, \u201cYeah I would.\"",
      "\u201cI think that he was treated pretty unfairly,\u201d Trump said, while at the same time acknowledging he doesn't \"know the facts.\u201d",
      "Adams has been accused of accepting flight upgrades and other luxury travel perks valued at $100,000 along with illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals looking to buy his influence. He has pleaded not guilty. Multiple members of his administration have also come under investigation.",
      "Adams, who insists he did nothing wrong, told reporters Monday that his attorney was \u201cgoing to look at every avenue to ensure I get justice.\"",
      "Trump was pressed repeatedly on the future of vaccines, amid concerns over his decision to choose the anti-vaccine advocate, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which regulates the shots.",
      "Trump again declined to dismiss the long-debunked theory that vaccines cause autism and said Kennedy would be examining that already well-studied question.",
      "But he also assured the public that one of the most successful vaccines would not be barred by his administration.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to lose the polio vaccine,\u201d he said, calling himself \u201ca big believer in it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not going to happen,\" he said.",
      "Outgoing Republican leader Mitch McConnell, who had polio as a child, had said Friday that Trump\u2019s nominees seeking Senate confirmation should \u201csteer clear\u201d of efforts to discredit the polio vaccine, calling them not just uninformed, but \u201cdangerous.\u201d",
      "Trump also weighed in on the mysterious drone sightings over parts of New Jersey and the eastern U.S. that have sparked speculation and concern over where they are coming from.",
      "Taking a conspiratorial tone, Trump insisted, without offering evidence, that, \u201cthe government knows what is happening.\"",
      "\u201cOur military knows and our president knows and for some reason they want to keep people in suspense,\u201d he said, refusing to say whether he had been briefed on the sightings.",
      "White House spokesperson John Kirby said later Monday that there is no indication that the drones pose a public safety or national security threat, and that he would say so if that weren't the case. While he acknowledged frustrations, he stressed that there are more 1 million legal drones in the country.",
      "\"Having closely examined the data,\" he said, \u201cwe assess that the sightings to date include a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones, as well as manned fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, and even stars that were mistakenly reported as drones.\u201d",
      "Trump has spent the weeks since his victory building out his incoming administration and speaking with what he said were well over 100 word leaders.",
      "But he again played coy on whether that list included Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment on the Putin question,\" he said.",
      "When it comes to escalating tensions in the Middle East, Trump said he would consider pulling U.S. troops out of Syria after the country's ousted leader, Bashar Assad, was overthrown by rebels.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that I want to have our soldiers killed,\u201d Trump said of the 900 men and women who were placed there to prevent a resurgence of the Islamic State group.",
      "In addition to meetings with foreign leaders, Trump also talked about a recent dinner with Apple CEO Tim Cook as well as the heads of major pharmaceutical companies, which Kennedy joined. The outreach, he said, made this transition feel markedly different from 2016, when his win shocked the Washington establishment.",
      "Trump was joined at the appearance by SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son, who announced that the Japanese company is planning to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years.",
      "It was a win for Trump, who has used the weeks since the election to promote his policies, negotiate with foreign leaders and try to strike deals.",

      "MOSCOW -- An estimated 3,700 tons of low-grade fuel oil had spilled into the Kerch Strait after two Russian ships were seriously damaged by stormy weather, Russian state media reported Monday.",
      "The two ships, the Volgoneft 239 and the Volgoneft 212, were transporting roughly 9,200 tons of mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Social media footage from the scene showed a black liquid rising among the waves.",
      "Preliminary estimates say that 3,700 tons of mazut leaked into the sea, Russian state news outlet RIA Novosti reported, citing an unnamed source. In a statement, the leader of Russia\u2019s nearby Krasnodar region, Gov. Veniamin Kondratev, said that the oil had not yet reached the shore.",
      "An emergency rescue operation was launched Sunday after the Volgoneft-212 tanker ran aground and had its bow torn away in storm conditions, Russia\u2019s Emergency Situations Ministry said. One sailor in the 13-man crew died, officials said.",
      "A second tanker, the Volgoneft-239, was also left damaged and adrift with 14 crewmembers on board. It later ran aground 80 meters from shore, close to the port of Taman in Russia\u2019s Krasnodar region, from where the sailors were later rescued.",
      "Russian officials confirmed the oil spill Sunday, but said that experts were still working to assess its full impact and extent.",

      "\u201cIt is likely to be driven by prevailing wind and currents and in the current weather conditions (it) is likely to be extremely difficult to contain. If it is driven ashore, then it will cause fouling of the shoreline which will be extremely difficult to clean up.\u201d",

      "TORONTO -- Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced the biggest test of his political career after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, resigned from the Cabinet on Monday.",
      "The stunning move raised questions about how much longer the prime minister of nearly 10 years \u2014 whose popularity has plummeted due to concerns about inflation and immigration \u2014 can stay on as his administration scrambles to deal with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Trudeau swiftly named longtime ally and friend Dominic LeBlanc, the pubic safety minister who recently joined him at dinner with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, to replace Freeland.",
      "After being sworn in, LeBlanc told reporters he and Trudeau are focused on the cost of living facing Canadians and on finding common ground with Trump on border security and economic issues.",

      "\u201cHe has to go,\u201d NDP leader Singh said.",
      "The main opposition Conservatives have not called for Trudeau\u2019s resignation but demand an election.",
      "Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said Trudeau had told her on Friday he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter that the only \u201chonest and viable path\u201d was to leave the Cabinet.",
      "\u201cFor the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,\u201d Freeland said.",
      "Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and 250 Canadian dollar ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said Canada is dealing with Trump's threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew \u201ccostly political gimmicks\" it can \u201cill afford.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur country is facing a grave challenge,\u201d Freeland said in her letter. \u201cThat means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.\u201d",
      "A Liberal party official said Freeland was offered a position as minister in charge of Canada-U.S. relations without portfolio and without a department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of not being authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the position would have been in name only and wouldn't have come with any of the tools Freeland previously had when she negotiated trade with the United States.",
      "Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, had been set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump's tariffs. Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless the neighbors stem the numbers of migrants and drugs.",
      "The statement shows a much larger deficit than expected for the fiscal year and more than a billion for border security.",
      "Trudeau has said he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but some party members have said they don't want him to run for a fourth term, and Freeland's departure was a huge blow.",
      "Trudeau met with his lawmakers on Monday evening. Later, most of them brushed past reporters, declining to say what was said in the meeting.",

      "When Donald Trump takes office as president for a second time, many journalists anticipate a hostile climate toward them and their work",
      "NEW YORK -- For the press heading into a second Trump administration, there's a balancing act between being prepared and being fearful.",
      "The return to power of Donald Trump, who has called journalists enemies and talked about retribution against those he feels have wronged him, has news executives nervous. Perceived threats are numerous: lawsuits of every sort, efforts to unmask anonymous sources, physical danger and intimidation, attacks on public media and libel protections, day-to-day demonization.",
      "In a closely-watched case settled over the weekend, ABC chose to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by the president-elect over an inaccurate statement made by George Stephanopoulos by agreeing to pay $15 million toward Trump\u2019s presidential library.",
      "\u201cThe news media is heading into this next administration with its eyes open,\u201d said Bruce Brown, executive director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press.",
      "\u201cSome challenges to the free press may be overt, some may be more subtle,\u201d Brown said. \u201cWe\u2019ll need to be prepared for rapid response as well as long campaigns to protect our rights \u2014 and to remember that our most important audiences are the courts and the public.\u201d",
      "One prominent editor warned against going on war footing with an administration that hasn't taken office yet. \u201cThere may be a moment to cry wolf here,\u201d said Stephen Engelberg, editor-in-chief of the nonprofit news outlet ProPublica. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached it.\u201d",
      "At a news conference on Monday, Trump said that \u201cwe need a fair media\u201d and discussed some potential and ongoing legal cases he has against news outlets.",
      "\u201cWe have to straighten out the press,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOur press is very corrupt, almost as corrupt as our elections.\u201d",
      "News organizations are heading into the second Trump era weak both financially and in public esteem. To a large extent, Trump sidestepped legacy media outlets during his campaign in favor of podcasters, yet still had time for specific beefs against ABC, CBS and NBC.",
      "The Trump team knows that many of its followers despise a probing press, and stoking that fury has political advantages. Two examples in the campaign to install Trump nominee Pete Hegseth as defense secretary shows how routine reporting activities can be characterized as an attack.",
      "When The New York Times was tipped to an email that Hegseth's mother once sent to him criticizing his treatment of women, it called her for comment. Penelope Hegseth later told Fox News that she perceived that as a threat, even though it enabled the newspaper to report that she had quickly apologized for sending the email and says she doesn't feel that way about him now.",
      "Pete Hegseth also used social media to say that ProPublica \u2014 he called it a \u201cLeft Wing hack group\u201d \u2014 was about to knowingly publish a false report that he hadn't been accepted into West Point decades ago. The news site had contacted him after officials at the military academy contradicted Hegseth's claim of acceptance. Hegseth provided proof that those officials were mistaken, and ProPublica never published a story.",
      "\u201cThat's journalism,\u201d noted ProPublica's Jesse Eisinger. But a narrative had taken hold: \u201cProPublica's botched Pete Hegseth smear,\u201d the New York Post called it in a headline.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Trump sued CBS News for the way it edited an interview with opponent Kamala Harris; suggested ABC News lose its broadcast license for fact-checking him during his lone debate with Harris; and successfully called for equal time on NBC after Harris appeared on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d In the Stephanopoulos lawsuit, the ABC anchor said Trump had been \u201cfound liable for rape\u201d in writer E. Jean Carroll's civil trial, when he had not.",
      "At his news conference, Trump said he was expecting to file a lawsuit against the Des Moines Register in Iowa for publishing results of a poll shortly before the election that suddenly had him behind Harris. He said that amounted to \u201cfraud and election interference.\u201d He eventually won the state handily. Spokeswoman Lark-Marie Anton says the Register stands by its reporting and believes a lawsuit would be without merit.",
      "Trump engages with the mainstream media \u2014 besides the news conference Monday he gave a newsmaking interview to NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this month \u2014 but journalists have to be alert to how their work will be portrayed.",
      "Trump's appointments, and what they've said about journalists, have raised alarms.",
      "Kash Patel, Trump's choice to lead the FBI, said on a podcast last year that \u201cwe're going to come after people in the media who lied about American citizens.\u201d Two appointees who have expressed hostility toward the media will be in a position to impact the work of journalists: Brendan Carr as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and Kari Lake as director of Voice of America.",
      "News organizations are worried that a Justice Department policy that has generally prohibited prosecutors from seizing the records of journalists in order to investigate leaks will be reversed, and are already urging journalists to protect their work. \u201cIf you have something you don't want to share with a broader audience, don't put it on the cloud,\u201d ProPublica's Engelberg said.",
      "During the first Trump administration, some journalists who covered immigration issues were pulled aside for screening and questioning. The Reporter's Committee wonders if this might happen again \u2014 and whether similar practices might extend toward reporting on expected deportations.",
      "The literary and human rights organization PEN America is concerned about journalists facing physical danger and digital hostility. It may have seemed like a flippant remark to some of his supporters when Trump, months after an attempt on his life, said at a rally that he wouldn't mind if somebody had to \u201cshoot through the fake news\u201d to get to him. But it wasn't for people standing on media risers.",
      "\u201cIt's important that the president act with responsibility to reduce physical violence against the press rather than encourage it,\u201d said Viktorya Vilk, PEN America's program director for digital safety and free expression.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana recently introduced a bill that would end taxpayer funding for public radio and television, a longtime goal of many Republicans that may get momentum with the party back in power. Some U.S. Supreme Court justices are eager to revisit a legal precedent that has made it difficult to prove defamation against news organizations.",
      "It's apparent that the new administration will come after the press in every conceivable way, former Washington Post editor Martin Baron said recently on NPR. \u201cI do think he will use every tool in his toolbox,\u201d Baron said, \u201cand there are a lot of tools.\u201d",
      "In their most pessimistic moments, advocates for the press look at what has happened in Hungary under the control of Prime Minister Viktor Orban. Since Orban took control in 2010, he and his supporters have taken control of most media and turned it into a propaganda arm.",
      "Don't think that can't happen in the United States, warns Andras Petho, an investigative journalist in Hungary who left a news website when it was pressured to stifle his work, and started the investigative journalism center Direkt36.",
      "Despite repression, there is still a market for independent journalism in Hungary, he said. Earlier this year, two Hungarian officials resigned following an outcry when it was revealed that they had pardoned a man who had forced children to retract sexual abuse claims made against the director of a government-run facility.",
      "Petho said it is important for journalists not to portray themselves as any sort of resistance, because that makes it easier for the government to dismiss them. Instead, they should just do the work.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, we all have to accept and admit that our power as media has declined,\u201d said Petho, who participated in the Nieman fellowship for journalists at Harvard University. \u201cOur stories don't have the same impact that they had a decade ago. But I wouldn't underestimate the power of the news media, either.\u201d",

      "U.S. stock indexes drifted through mixed trading ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set Wall Street\u2019s direction into next year",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading Monday, ahead of this week\u2019s upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve  that could set Wall Street\u2019s direction into next year.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, coming off its first losing week in the last four. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a laggard and fell 110 points, or 0.3%.",
      "Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts\u2019 expectations. The technology company is riding a wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings in particular.",
      "The market\u2019s main event, though, will arrive on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%.",
      "The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting.",
      "For now, the general expectation among traders is that the Fed may cut a couple more times in 2025, according to data from CME Group. But such expectations have been shrinking following reports  suggesting inflation may be tougher to get all the way down to 2% from here. Besides last month\u2019s slight acceleration in inflation, another worry is that President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s preferences for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation down the line.",
      "Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle has dropped his earlier forecast of a cut by the Fed in January, for example. Beyond the possibility of tariffs, he said Fed officials may also want to slow their cuts because of uncertainty about exactly how low rates need to go so that they no longer press the brakes on the economy.",
      "Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium. The economy has held up better than many feared, continuing to grow even after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on inflation, which topped 9% two summers ago.",
      "On Wall Street, MicroStrategy jumped as much as 7% during the day as it continues to benefit from the surging price for bitcoin, which set another all-time high. But its stock ended the day down by les than 0.1% after bitcoin\u2019s price pulled back below $106,000 after setting a record above $107,700, according to CoinDesk.",
      "The software company has been building its hoard of the cryptocurrency, and its stock price has more than sextupled this year. It will also soon join the Nasdaq 100 index.",
      "Bitcoin\u2019s price has catapulted from roughly $44,000 at the start of the year, riding a recent wave of enthusiasm that Trump  will create a system that\u2019s more favorable to digital currencies.",
      "Honeywell rose 3.7% after saying it\u2019s still considering a spin-off or sale of its aerospace business, as part of a review of its overall business. It said it plans to give an update with the release of its fourth-quarter results.",
      "They helped offset a drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world\u2019s move into AI. Its stock fell 1.7%. Because it\u2019s grown so massive, with a total value topping $3 trillion, it was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500.",
      "All told, the S&P 500 rose 22.99 points to 6,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 110.58 to 43,717.48, and the Nasdaq composite rose 247.17 to 20,173.89.",
      "In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.39% from 4.40% late Friday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, eased to 4.24% from 4.25%.",
      "In stock markets abroad, indexes fell modestly across much of Europe and Asia.",
      "They sank 0.9% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai after China reported lackluster economic indicators for November despite attempts to strengthen the world\u2019s second-largest economy.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell 0.2% as law enforcement authorities pushed to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree, and the Constitutional Court met to discuss whether to remove him from office or reinstate him.",

      "When the Milwaukee Bucks clinched their spot in the NBA Cup championship game, plenty of the team\u2019s younger and lesser-paid players were exuberant in the locker room",
      "LAS VEGAS -- When the Milwaukee Bucks clinched their spot in the NBA Cup championship game, plenty of the team's younger and lesser-paid players were exuberant in the locker room.",
      "Yes, they have a chance at a trophy. Those are nice.",
      "They'll also have a chance at their biggest payday of their careers. The NBA Cup final \u2014 the Bucks vs. the Oklahoma City Thunder \u2014 is Tuesday in Las Vegas, with an additional $308,983 in prize money going to each of the players on the winning team.",
      "For the league's superstars, that amount might represent a game's pay \u2014 or maybe even a half-game's pay. For much of the league, it's still a colossal sum.",
      "\u201cI try not to think about the money,\u201d said Bucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is making about $48.8 million this season. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not accurate what I\u2019m saying. I think about the money \u2014 but I think about the money when we talk about the young guys.\u201d",
      "Winning players Tuesday will receive $514,971 from the league's Cup prize pool if they're on standard NBA contracts. The players on the losing team Tuesday will get $205,988 apiece; players on two-way deals will get half of those figures.",
      "At his current salary of $578,577, Thunder two-way player Ajay Mitchell would be making about $7,056 per game. He's going to do a lot better than that on Tuesday, win or lose.",
      "\u201cObviously, there\u2019s a lot of money on the line,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cBut my main focus is just on the win. It\u2019s exciting to know that there\u2019s money on the line, but the main focus is just winning another basketball game.\u201d",
      "The NBA Cup has a prize pool to incentivize players. The teams that lost in the semifinals \u2014 Atlanta and Houston \u2014 saw their players collect $102,994 each; the teams that bowed out in the quarterfinals \u2014 New York, Orlando, Golden State and Dallas \u2014 saw their players collect $51,497 apiece.",
      "\u201cI might get a new watch,\" Knicks forward Josh Hart, who was asked what he'd do with his bonus, said in a response that went viral \u2014 and it should be noted he wasn't being entirely serious. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about the young guys getting money. I only care about me, what I\u2019m going to spend.\"",
      "For six of the players on the Bucks and Thunder rosters \u2014 Antetokounmpo and Milwaukee teammates Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton and Brook Lopez, along with Oklahoma City's Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Isaiah Hartenstein \u2014 the difference between winning and losing Tuesday isn't even an average day at the office. Those six guys, on average, are making about $443,300 per game.",
      "For everyone else, the trip to Vegas will be a nice bump \u2014 some nicer than others.",
      "\u201cNot everybody gets the same paycheck in the NBA,\u201d said Thunder forward Jalen Williams, who is making about $4.8 million this season. \u201cWe have guys that are on two-way contracts and some guys that are fighting to stay in the league. So, obviously, that money is a bigger deal for some people than others \u2014 so we definitely play for that.\u201d",
      "Bucks reserve A.J. Green makes about $2.1 million this season. The idea of adding $500,000 to that for winning one game blew his mind.",
      "\u201cIt is crazy,\u201d Green said. \u201cBut that shouldn\u2019t make you play any harder. It really shouldn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Nothing makes Bucks forward Bobby Portis play harder; he's one of the guys in the league who seems to treat every game with the same all-out vigor. He's from Little Rock, Arkansas, where the median household income is about $60,000 and it\u2019s estimated that 1 in 6 people in that city of about 200,000 are living in poverty.",
      "It's not lost on Portis \u2014 who's making about $12.6 million this season \u2014 how lucky he is.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll take guys a lifetime to make $500,000 where I\u2019m from,\u201d Portis said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t take any dollar amount lightly.\u201d",
      "Green said he would give some of that bonus to his church, some of it to the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and save the rest. Mitchell plans on saving just about all of whatever comes his way from his NBA Cup experience.",
      "Antetokounmpo\u2019s NBA contracts \u2014 past and future \u2014 add up to about $460 million, and that\u2019s just the total of his on-court deals. He fulfilled his life dream of being able to provide for his family long ago; he\u2019s built wealth that will last for generations. That said, he still says Tuesday should be significant to everyone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s life-changing money,\u201d Antetokounmpo said. \u201cObviously, $500,000, you can put a down payment on a house. You can put the down payment on two houses. ... It\u2019s an ongoing joke we have in our locker room. We say we play for the young guys because this money will mean a lot to them. But it really means a lot to everybody \u2014 because it\u2019s a lot of money.\u201d",

      "San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich expressed his gratitude and his desire to return to the bench in his first public statement since suffering a stroke last month",
      "SAN ANTONIO -- San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich intends to return to coaching, he said Monday in his first public comments since suffering a stroke in early November.",
      "Popovich, the NBA's career coaching wins leader, released a statement through the Spurs expressing gratitude for the support he has received in recent weeks. He had what the Spurs said was a mild stroke about 2 1/2 hours prior to the team's home game against Minnesota on Nov. 2.",
      "There is no timetable for his return to coaching, though the Spurs have said doctors expect Popovich to make a full recovery.",
      "\u201cThis has certainly been an unexpected six weeks for my family and me,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cAs we work together on my recovery, I want to take a moment to share that the outpouring of support we\u2019ve received during this time has been truly overwhelming in the best possible way.",
      "\u201cWhile I wish I could get back to each one of you, for now, let me say that my family and I are forever grateful. We\u2019re thankful for our wonderful community, the entire Spurs organization, and our family and friends.\u201d",
      "The 75-year-old Popovich has led the Spurs to five championships and guided the United States to a gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021. He is in his 29th season as coach of the Spurs.",
      "The stroke happened at the team's arena, and since rescue workers were there, Popovich was able to start receiving treatment almost immediately. He was transported to a nearby hospital.",
      "It has not been revealed what lingering effects of the stroke Popovich is dealing with, and how much longer his rehabilitation process may take. Longtime Spurs assistant Mitch Johnson has served as acting coach in Popovich's absence.",
      "\u201cMitch has done an incredible job,\u201d Orlando coach Jamahl Mosley said earlier this month.",
      "In his typical self-deprecating style, Popovich said those assisting in his rehabilitation are eager for him to return to work.",
      "Evidently, he's not the best patient \u2014 or a patient person.",
      "\u201cNo one is more excited to see me return to the bench than the talented individuals who have been leading my rehabilitation process,\u201d Popovich said. \u201cThey\u2019ve quickly learned that I\u2019m less than coachable.\u201d",
      "Popovich is one of only three coaches to win the NBA coach of the year award three times, Don Nelson and Pat Riley being the others. He\u2019s one of five coaches with at least five NBA titles; Phil Jackson (11), Red Auerbach (nine), John Kundla (five) and Riley (five) are the others.",
      "Popovich has been part of the Spurs for nearly 35 years. He was an assistant coach from 1988-92, then returned to the club on May 31, 1994, as its executive vice president for basketball operations and general manager. He fired coach Bob Hill and appointed himself coach on Dec. 10, 1996.",
      "He\u2019s been the Spurs\u2019 sideline boss ever since.",
      "\u201cWe look forward to the day that we can welcome him back,\u201d Spurs general manager Brian Wright said last month.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 18:50:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson has resigned",
    "story": [
      "Wake Forest coach Dave Clawson has resigned",
      "Wake Forest's Dave Clawson won big at the private university with one of the smallest enrollments in the Bowl Subdivision ranks. Now it's up to someone else to try to do the same.",
      "Clawson resigned Monday, ending an 11-year run with an unexpected announcement that he had given \u201deverything I had\" for the program and school.",
      "His tenure included guiding Wake Forest to 11 wins and a trip to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship game in 2021, as well as cracking the top 10 of the AP poll in 2021 and 2022 amid a run of six straight bowl appearances. But the Demon Deacons had gone just 4-8 in the past two seasons as the formula that had helped them sustain success became trickier to manage in today's era of free player movement through the transfer portal and players being able to cash in on their athletic fame through name, image and likeness (NIL) opportunities.",
      "In a statement released by the school, the 57-year-old coach said \u201cthe timing is right\u201d after working 36 straight seasons in college football to step into a new advisory role to athletic director John Currie with an undergraduate enrollment of 5,471 students as of the 2023-24 academic year.",
      "\u201cCoaching at Wake Forest has been the honor of my career,\u201d Clawson said. \u201dThis is a special place with extraordinary people, and I am deeply grateful for the relationships I\u2019ve built over the last 11 years. Together, we achieved things that many thought impossible, and I step down knowing I gave everything I had for this program and university.\"",
      "In an open letter on the school's athletics site that has been a regular fixture, Currie said Clawson's decision was \u201cnot the news we had wanted to share.\u201d Currie said Clawson had confided that he was contemplating his future in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cAnd I held out hope, until our meeting earlier today, that he would change his mind,\u201d Currie wrote, noting that Clawson and Currie met with the team via Zoom to inform them shortly before the school's announcement.",
      "Clawson took over in 2014 after Jim Grobe's successful run that included winning the 2006 ACC title. And much like Grobe, Clawson found success at the elite but small private university with a formula that leaned on player retention and long-term development to compete against programs drawing four- and five-star recruits.",
      "Clawson's Demon Deacons typically redshirt young players and bring them along slowly, allowing them to get stronger and picking up larger roles to hone their skills. By the time most of those players would crack the two-deep depth chart, the goal then would be to play disciplined football with clean execution while avoiding self-defeating mistakes.",
      "When working its best, Wake Forest often had a prolific, tempo-controlling offense \u2014 featuring an ability to churn out developed receivers \u2014 while ranking among the nation's leaders for fewest penalty yards and turnovers. And there was long runs of coaching continuity on Clawson's staff with few changes, a combination that Currie said in a statement \u201cmade football at Wake Forest important.\u201d",
      "During that seven-year bowl run (2016-22), Wake Forest ranked tied for eighth in the FBS in turnover margin (+39), No. 8 in fewest penalty yards per game (42.2) and No. 9 in fewest penalties per game (4.93).",
      "It all came together in 2021, a season that included Clawson reaching a long-term contract extension with the school on the eve of the ACC division-clinching win at Boston College.",
      "That 11-win team lost to Pittsburgh in the ACC championship game in a season. But it was a magical season, with the Demon Deacons starting 8-0 and hitting No. 10 in the poll, led by star quarterback Sam Hartman in an offense ranked fourth nationally in scoring (41.0) while also ranking sixth in third-down conversion rate (49.6%).",
      "And yet, Hartman soon became an example of the challenges of today\u2019s climate for Clawson and the rest of FBS ranks. Two years later, Hartman was gone \u2014 not because he had run out of eligibility, but because he was transferring for a one-year run at Notre Dame in a high-profile player move.",
      "Clawson spoke multiple times, too, about the challenges of retaining players in this era. Notably, he said roughly a half-dozen of his players returned for the 2023 season despite tampering efforts by other schools promising lucrative endorsement deals to transfer ranging from roughly $150,000 to $500,000.",
      "This year's team ranked near the bottom of the national stats in defense (117th in total at 435.0 yards, 113th in scoring (32.5), and languished through multiple losses that seemed to wear on Clawson in his postgame news conferences.",
      "That included the Demon Deacons blowing a 13-point fourth-quarter lead at home to lose to Virginia in their second game, then losing at home to Louisiana three weeks later when their final-play tying field goal from 42 yards out plunked the left upright. Still, Clawson guided Wake Forest wins in its first three road games to recover from a 1-3 start and enter November needing to split the final four games to become bowl eligible again.",
      "Instead, the Demon Deacons lost them all. The last came at home to Duke, with the Blue Devils rallying from 14 down and winning on a 39-yard touchdown pass as time expired.",
      "That crushing loss, with Wake Forest punting on its final three possessions to go 1-6 at home, turned out to be Clawson's Wake Forest finale.",

      "CLEMSON, S.C. -- Practice plans. Film breakdowns. Travel bookings. Clemson coach Dabo Swinney had his focus split several ways getting ready to face No. 4 Texas in the College Football Playoff.",
      "Still, Swinney had enough time to follow how Super Bowl-winning coach Bill Belichick joined the Atlantic Coast Conference as North Carolina's new leader.",
      "\u201cIt's incredible,\u201d Swinney said Monday, his face breaking into a huge grin.",
      "Swinney, like Belichick, knows about winning championships with nine ACC titles and two national titles in 16 full seasons with the Tigers.",
      "He's got nothing but admiration for Belichick, who has 302 wins in the NFL and six Super Bowl victories as a head coach, all the championships with the New England Patriots.",
      "Most figured that the 72-year-old Belichick, whose tenure with New England ended after last season, would wait for his next NFL chance to return to coaching. Yet he accepted the job with the Tar Heels last week and has already begun putting together a program Belichick expects to rival Clemson in terms of time at the top of the ACC.",
      "\u201cI mean, it's pretty cool,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cIt's going to be something seeing him walk into ACC meetings or things like that.\u201d",
      "Swinney has had his hands full this week prepping for the fifth-seeded Longhorns (11-2) on Friday. The 13th-ranked Tigers (10-3) earned the 12th and final CFP seed with a 34-31 win over SMU on Dec. 7 on a dramatic, 56-yard field goal by freshman Nolan Hauser as time expired.",
      "The Tigers will head to Texas on Thursday.",
      "Swinney took some time, though, to recall his only meeting with Belichick, which came at one of Clemson's pro days during the Tigers' run of six straight CFP appearances from 2015-20. Both were complimentary of the other during their visit.",
      "Swinney was present at a pair of Patriot Super Bowls, both coming as Belichick had Clemson tight end Dwayne Allen on his roster. The first came in Atlanta in February 2017 when New England rallied from a 28-3 deficit to beat the Falcons in overtime, 34-28.",
      "The next year, Swinney was in attendance in Minneapolis as Allen and the Patriots fell to Philadelphia 41-33.",
      "Wes Goodwin, Clemson\u2019s defensive coordinator, has studied Belichick\u2019s defensive schemes for years and believes Belichick will elevate the Tar Heels\u2019 defense and that improvement will spread through the ACC.",
      "\u201cI think its going to be huge for this league,\u201d Goodwin said, \u201cin getting that type of coaching and leadership.\u201d",
      "Swinney has had success against the best of the best in the past. Both Clemson national titles in 2016 and 2018 came over Alabama and national championship icon Nick Saban. Swinney won all three matchups in six seasons against Belichick's Tar Heels predecessor in Mack Brown, who won a national crown at Texas.",
      "Swinney thinks Belichick will make a quick, positive impact on North Carolina. The Tigers go to North Carolina next season, although the date hasn't yet been set.",
      "\u201cI mean, it's great for college football,\u201d Swinney said. \u201cThere are a lot of great coaches in this league. And again, for him to want to come into that, I think, says a lot.\u201d",
      "Will Belichick rival Swinney's news conferences, known for being quite lengthy as he willingly answers just about every question asked?",
      "\u201cDon't know if he's going to give you any depth chart answer,\u201d Swinney said with a chuckle.",
      "But count on, a \u201cWe're on to Pittsburgh,\u201d response, he said.",
      "Belichick will up the league's profile for as long as he's on the North Carolina sidelines, Swinney continued.",

      "The banged-up Detroit Lions took some serious hits in their loss to the Buffalo Bills",
      "ALLEN PARK, Mich. -- The banged-up Detroit Lions took some serious hits in their loss to the Buffalo Bills.",
      "\u201cNobody cares,\u201d coach Dan Campbell said Monday. \u201cNobody is going to give us a pass, or put an asterisk next to your record.\"",
      "Running back David Montgomery and defensive tackle Alim McNeill need to have season-ending knee surgeries after both were hurt in the setback to Buffalo, Campbell said. Khalil Dorsey had season-ending surgery Sunday night after breaking his leg against the Bills.",
      "The Lions will also be indefinitely without cornerback Carlton Davis III, who had a jaw injury in the 48-42 loss to Buffalo that ended their franchise-record, 11-game winning streak.",
      "\u201cNot sure how long that\u2019s going to be, I just know in the immediate future, I don\u2019t see it,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "Detroit's roster has been decimated, putting 18 players on injured reserve and the latest wave will push that total past 20.",
      "The Lions have lost six starters on defense from their Week 1 lineup, including defensive end Aidan Hutchinson, who broke his leg two months ago at Dallas.",
      "Detroit (12-2) has overcome the series of injuries, which have hit the defense particularly hard, well enough to win 11 straight games before losing to Buffalo.",
      "The setback allowed Philadelphia to pull into a tie with Detroit for top seeding in the NFC and gave Minnesota a chance to share first place in the NFC North with three games left in the regular season. The Vikings close the regular season at Detroit.",
      "\u201cSometimes, you got to get punched in the face,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cThis is good for us. We\u2019re going to use this to our advantage and get ready for a division opponent on the road.\u201d",
      "The Lions play at Chicago on Sunday.",
      "Montgomery will miss an opportunity to play against his former team and to help Detroit attempt to at least reach the Super Bowl for the first time in team history. He played through his knee injury against the Bills, who limited him to 4 yards rushing on five carries and four catches for 31 yards.",
      "\u201cDavid is so tough,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "Montgomery ran for 775 yards and 12 touchdowns, rotating with speedy running back Jahmyr Gibbs, and had 36 receptions for 341 yards.",
      "\u201cWe're going to miss him,\u201d Campbell said.",
      "McNeill will leave a big void on the defensive line, a position group that had seven players on injured reserve before the standout defensive tackle was injured. He had seven tackles for losses, tied for the team lead with Hutchinson and linebacker Alex Anzalone, who is also on injured reserve.",
      "Davis defended 11 passes, trailing only Brian Branch's total, and had two interceptions, ranking third on the team this season.",
      "Dorsey was among the top tacklers on special teams and returned four kickoffs, including one for 72 yards to help Detroit pull away in a tied game with Tennessee.",
      "\u201cSome guys are going to have an unbelievable opportunity,\u201d Campbell said. \u201cYou\u2019re a guy who\u2019s on the vet squad or you\u2019re a young player or you\u2019re somebody that\u2019s been dying to get an opportunity, you\u2019re about to get it.\u201d",

      "Penn State backup quarterback Beau Pribula wants to spend his last two years of eligibility as a starter and knows he\u2019d likely have to wait at least another year in Happy Valley with starter Drew Allar returning next season",
      "STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- Penn State coach James Franklin hopes college football players soon won\u2019t have to make the same decision as backup quarterback Beau Pribula.",
      "The sophomore, who played a key role in No. 5 Penn State\u2019s first run to the College Football Playoff, won't be a part of the team\u2019s quest for a national championship that begins against SMU at Beaver Stadium on Saturday. He has decided to enter the NCAA transfer portal.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got problems in college football,\u201d Franklin said Monday. \u201cHe did not want to leave our program until the end of the season, but the way the portal is, and the timing of it, when you play the position of quarterback and there\u2019s only one spot and those spots are filling up, he felt like he was put in a no-win situation. And I agree with him.\u201d",
      "By rule, players looking to transfer must enter the portal by Dec. 28. They cannot do so again until April 16, 2025. That timeframe \u2014 approved in October in a move that reduced the window by 15 days after earlier complaints from coaches \u2014 is not ideal, Franklin said. Last week, Marshall pulled out of a bowl game after too many of its players hit the portal.",
      "Pribula wants to spend his last two years of eligibility as a starter and knows he\u2019d likely have to wait at least another year in Happy Valley with starter Drew Allar returning for his senior year next season.",
      "Waiting until April to transfer would have left Pribula with fewer options and less time to adjust to a new team as most programs will have signed quarterbacks and be well into spring practices or finished by the portal\u2019s April 25 closing date.",
      "But the native of York, Pennsylvania, also wanted to chase an NCAA championship with the program he dreamed of one day starting for, too. Instead, the dual-threat player who chipped in 517 yards of total offense and had a hand in nine total touchdown this season will spend the rest of the month looking for a new program.",
      "\u201cBeau grew up wanting to come to Penn State his whole life,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cThis is his dream school and he had a phenomenal career here and I just want everyone to understand that most importantly, and why have we created a system where this guy couldn\u2019t finish the season with his team?\u201d",
      "Although Franklin has said previously that Penn State players who enter the portal are no longer part of the program\u2019s plans, he was willing to make an exception for Pribula.",
      "But at practice earlier this week, both Franklin and Pribula felt the quarterback\u2019s attention was elsewhere. They agreed to part ways so Pribula could focus on finishing his finals on campus and taking official visits to new schools.",
      "\u201cBeau felt like he was going to have a hard time finishing school, finding a place that he wanted to go to, and still preparing like the starter like he\u2019d been doing all year long,\u201d Franklin said.",
      "While he wasn\u2019t the starter, Pribula delivered when he was called on.",
      "Pribula helped salvage Penn State\u2019s run to the Big Ten title game when he replaced an injured Allar with the Nittany Lions trailing at Wisconsin. Pribula led the way in a 28-13 comeback win, completing 11 of 13 passes for 98 yards and a touchdown and running six times for 48 yards.",
      "\u201cBeau is one of the best teammates I\u2019ve ever had,\u201d center Nick Dawkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s tough when they have windows like that that allow guys to have to make personal decisions that impact the team, so it\u2019s a tough situation obviously for him and I only wish him the best.\u201d",
      "Without Pribula, Penn State will likely turn to freshman Ethan Grunkemeyer to back up Allar. While Grunkemeyer has traveled with the team, he has yet to take a snap in a game.",
      "Fellow freshman Jaxon Smolik could also see time, but was only recently cleared to resume practice after recovering from an unspecified injury that\u2019s kept him out all season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a spoke in the wheel of what we\u2019re doing, that kind of package,\" offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki said, \u201cso it\u2019ll be replaced with another kind of spoke.\"",

      "The San Francisco 49ers have suspended linebacker De\u2019Vondre Campbell for the final three games of the regular season after he refused to enter a game after losing his starting job",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- The San Francisco 49ers suspended linebacker De\u2019Vondre Campbell for the rest of the regular season after he refused to enter a game after losing his starting job.",
      "General manager John Lynch announced the news on Monday that Campbell was suspended for three games for conduct detrimental to the team.",
      "The news came four days after Campbell's refusal to go into a game against the Los Angeles Rams was decried by coaches and teammates as a \u201cselfish\u201d act. Coach Kyle Shanahan said Friday that Campbell would no longer be part of the team, with the only question whether that would be by a suspension or an outright release.",
      "The team opted for the suspension. The Collective Bargaining Agreement allows teams to suspend a player for up to four games without pay for conduct detrimental to the team and fine them one week's pay.",
      "\u201cI just lost all respect,\u201d cornerback Deommodore Lenoir said Monday. \u201cI\u2019m a person that\u2019s going 110% every play. ... I just feel like he\u2019s a cancer to the team.\u201d",
      "Campbell makes about $67,000 in base salary each week under the one-year $5 million contract he signed in March. Campbell also will miss the chance to earn $60,000 in weekly roster bonuses and the Niners could try to recoup about $111,000 from Campbell's signing bonus.",
      "Had the 49ers waived Campbell, he would have had the opportunity to be claimed or sign with another team.",
      "Campbell had started 12 of the first 13 games of the season and played 90% of defensive snaps for the 49ers but was benched Thursday night after Dre Greenlaw came back for his first game since tearing his left Achilles tendon in last season\u2019s Super Bowl.",
      "When the 49ers wanted to put Campbell in the game in the third quarter because Greenlaw was sidelined with soreness in his Achilles tendon, Campbell refused, something Shanahan said has never happened to him in his time as a head coach or an assistant in the NFL.",
      "Defensive end Nick Bosa said he got a sense of Campbell's frustration before the game but didn't say anything at the time.",
      "\u201cIn the locker room before the game, I heard some complaining,\u201d Bosa said. \u201cI was going to say something but didn\u2019t because I didn\u2019t want to create more of a distraction. But I kind of felt it. I kind of saw the foreshadowing. I definitely didn\u2019t think it was going to result in that.\u201d",
      "Bosa said he doesn't regret not trying to make it an issue before the game because \u201cif he was going to do that then he\u2019s not the type of guy to be here.\u201d",
      "Campbell walked off the field with a towel draped over his head and went into the locker room before the end of the game with the Rams that almost ended the 49ers\u2019 playoff hopes. Shanahan said he didn\u2019t send Campbell to the locker room and didn\u2019t know why he left the field.",
      "Campbell\u2019s decision left his teammates angered and bewildered after the game and that hadn't changed a few days later. But Bosa said he doesn't see Campbell's actions as a reflection of a team that has lost its way.",
      "\u201cThis locker room is great,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been great. But sometimes when you bring somebody who\u2019s older in from a different place, you don\u2019t know. He was a good dude. It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t like him. But there\u2019s no issues in this locker room.\u201d",
      "The 31-year-old Campbell signed in the offseason with San Francisco after being cut by Green Bay in March. He had been an All-Pro in 2021 for the Packers but his play fell off the last two seasons in Green Bay.",
      "That led to Campbell complaining on social media that he was misused by Green Bay. He expressed excitement about being with a new team but he never got back to his All-Pro level. Campbell had a few bright moments in San Francisco this season but struggled frequently with tackling and in coverage.",

The case upended his stardom on the field at a time when he was the posterchild for modern football. Vick made a comeback after he was released with the Philadelphia Eagles, but his prime years were behind him.

      "The WNBA will stage its first regular season game outside the U.S. when Atlanta and Seattle play in Vancouver on Aug. 15, the league announced Monday.",
      "The league has had two exhibition games in Canada, including one played by Seattle in Edmonton this past season. The Toronto Tempo will begin play in 2026 as the first international team in league history.",
      "\u201cThe WNBA Canada Game has been a tremendous opportunity to grow our league\u2019s footprint, and we look forward to hosting the first-ever international regular season game with the Seattle Storm\u2019s return to Canada to face the Atlanta Dream,\" WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said. \"As we prepare to establish permanent roots in Canada with a Toronto franchise, this game and our year-round engagement efforts are a nod to the incredible momentum around women\u2019s basketball in Canada.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has a high-ankle sprain and his status for this week\u2019s game against Houston remains in question, a person familiar with the results told The Associated Press on Monday",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has a high-ankle sprain, additional testing confirmed, and his status for this week's game against Houston remains in question, a person familiar with the results told The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the team did not announce any updates. The Chiefs did not have any usual availability Monday, but are scheduled to practice Tuesday ahead of their Saturday matchup with the Texans.",
      "Mahomes was hurt when his ankle was rolled up on while being tackled by the Browns' Dalvin Tomlinson on a fourth down play late in the Chiefs' 21-7 win Sunday. Mahomes limped to the sideline and Carson Wentz played the rest of the way in his place, but the two-time MVP insisted afterward that he would have lobbied to play if the Browns had gotten within one score.",
      "\u201cI feel like I could have finished the game in different circumstances,\" Mahomes said afterward, \u201cbut I thought the smart decision, I think we talked about, was to put Carson in, and he\u2019s played a lot of football, and he finished the game well.\u201d",
      "Mahomes has a history of ankle injuries, including a similar one against Jacksonville in Week 1 of the 2019 season. But perhaps most memorable was the playoffs in the 2022 season, when Mahomes hurt his ankle in a divisional-round win over the Jaguars, then played through the pain in beating Cincinnati for the AFC title and Philadelphia in the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cI mean, they're all different. Every injury is different,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cYou know what you have to do to get back. And I think that is the most important thing. And now we just get back to the rehab part \u2014 the treatment part \u2014 and try to get ourselves ready on a short week against a good football team.\u201d",
      "Indeed, the schedule is doing the Chiefs no favors. They have one less day of recovery this week because of their Saturday game against Houston, then they have another short week with a trip to Pittsburgh scheduled for Christmas Day.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll just see how it goes,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said after Sunday's game. \"We are going to go day to day as we go through it. I don\u2019t know how much swelling he has or any of that, so we don\u2019t know what will come.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs (13-1) have a two-game lead over Buffalo for the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs, though the Bills hold the tiebreaker. The Texans have clinched the AFC South while the Steelers lead the AFC North and have clinched a playoff berth.",
      "Kansas City wraps up the regular season with a trip to the Broncos, who are also closing in on a spot in the postseason.",
      "If the Chiefs play it safe by resting Mahomes on Saturday \u2014 and even next week against Pittsburgh \u2014 they feel confident in the ability of Wentz to win a game. He was a Pro Bowl pick in 2017 during his first five seasons in Philadelphia, and he is 47-45-1 as a starter, including his year in Indianapolis, another in Washington and a single spot start last season for the Rams.",
      "Wentz, who signed a $3.325 million contract with Kansas City to replace Blaine Gabbert as Mahomes' backup, completed both of his pass attempts for 20 yards and helped the Chiefs run out the clock against the Browns on Sunday.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of trust with Carson,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cI mean, he\u2019s played football and he\u2019s won football games and put him out there and they did a great job moving the football running time off the clock, and putting us in position to win the football game.\u201d",
      "NOTES: The Chiefs waived RB Clyde Edwards-Helaire on Monday. He was the 32nd overall pick in the 2020 draft, but ran for just 1,845 yards and 12 touchdowns while appearing in 48 games over four years in Kansas City. The well-liked Edwards-Helaire dealt with injuries and personal issues throughout his career and had not appeared in a game this season.",

      "Tennessee is among five unbeatens left in men's Division I basketball and one of three from the Southeastern Conference, joining No. 7 Florida (10-0)and No. 14 Oklahoma (10-0). Drake (9-0) and Utah State (10-0) also enter this week undefeated.",
      "\u201cWe know watching film there's a lot of areas we have to get better with, more consistent,\u201d Barnes said Monday. \u201cIt's everybody. Coaches getting better, players getting better. When you're in December, you have to be real. Look at film and realize we've done this or that, but we have a long way to go to be where we want to be.\u201d",
      "Auburn improved to 9-1 with its 91-53 blowout of Ohio State in Atlanta. Johni Broome showed the way with 21 points and 20 rebounds for the Tigers' first 20-20 game in 35 years, then he raced back to Auburn for his graduation Saturday night.",
      "\u201cThey may be the best team in the country right now,\u201d Ohio State coach Jake Diebler said. \u201cThey have a lot of experience, and they made us pay when we made a mistake.\u201d",

Wisconsin dropped out after its loss to Illinois while Mississippi State fell out after a narrow win over McNeese State.",
      "San Diego State, Michigan and Clemson round out the Top 25.",
      "Drake appeared on 11 ballots after an easy win over St. Ambrose kept first-year coach Ben McCollum's club unbeaten. Utah State showed up on 10 ballots after blowing out South Florida to give the Aggies their best start in school history.",
      "\u201cI've said all along, this is a place you can win at a high level consistently, and we've shown that, right? Year after year,\u201d Utah State coach Jarrod Calhoun said. \u201cWe never talk about making history. It was never talked about all week. ... It's about getting better each day. It's about enjoying the process.\"",

      "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Miami Dolphins wide receiver Grant DuBose remained in the hospital but had movement in all extremities after being stretchered off the field following a scary helmet-to-helmet hit against the Houston Texans on Sunday.",
      "In an update Monday morning, the Dolphins said DuBose remained at a local Houston hospital for evaluation overnight, and that initial tests revealed \u201cpositive results\u201d following the collision.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be excited to see him when doctors deem it appropriate for him to fly,\u201d coach Mike McDaniel said later Monday.",
      "DuBose tried to make a catch in the third quarter, but was hit in the head by safety Calen Bullock before his head violently hit the turf. He appeared to clench both fists after the hit \u2014 movements consistent with what\u2019s referred to as the \u201cfencing response,\u201d which can be common after a traumatic brain injury \u2014 before remaining motionless as medical personnel rushed to his side.",
      "DuBose was tended to by emergency medical personnel on the field for at least 10 minutes. His jersey was cut off him and a neck brace was put on him while players from both teams took a knee and watched with concern.",
      "DuBose was eventually put on a spine board where his arms and legs were strapped down and he was taken off the field. A tube of some kind was in his mouth and no movement could be seen as he was taken off the field and later hospitalized in stable condition.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s very unfortunate,\u201d Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa said afterward, \u201cvery tough to have seen live.\u201d",
      "Tagovailoa, who has had multiple concussions in his NFL career, including one that had him taken off the field on a stretcher at Cincinnati in 2022, said it was tough to move on after that happened.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m my toughest critic when it comes to ball placement,\u201d Tagovailoa said, \u201cwhen it comes to knowing where to go with the ball and all of that. I just feel bad that I even put him in that situation to have gotten hit.\u201d",
      "Sunday was DuBose's first game since Week 2 because of a shoulder injury.",
      "At one point while he was down, the Dolphins moved away from DuBose and into a circle where they kneeled and prayed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that I think the only way you get through something like that is with your teammates,\u201d McDaniel said. \u201cI think we needed each other at that time, and you also have in the back of your mind, knowing Grant and what would make him proud and just the human being that he is, so you\u2019re trying to do right by him and the team and the situation. There\u2019s no really right answer, ultimately.\u201d",
      "Cornerback Kader Kohou said it was a relief to get positive news about DuBose's condition Monday morning, and that the team was immediately worried about DuBose's family.",
      "\u201cI think in that moment we forget the football aspect of it and we just were praying for him to get better,\" Kohou said. \"His family was at home watching, we\u2019re just praying for them and hoping everything went smooth.\u201d",

      "The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said the Rev. Chette L. Williams fell into the water from his pontoon boat Sunday evening. His body was found about 90 minutes later. He was 61. The accident occurred near a dock at Kowaliga\u2019s Restaurant on Lake Martin in Elmore County.",

      "Drones are being spotted all over the U.S. But are those flashing lights in the sky really airplanes",
      "Up in the sky, is that a drone, a plane or a helicopter?",
      "Experts who study unmanned aircraft systems \u2014 better known as drones \u2014 say it can be tough to tell from miles away. But there are clues.",
      "A light in the sky at night can easily be misinterpreted, according to John Slaughter, director of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research and Operations Center at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk outside and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not a drone,\u2019 or \u2018That is one.\u2019 All you can really factually say is \u2018I saw a light in the sky,\u2019\" Slaughter said.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights first spotted in New Jersey last month and now being seen across the U.S. have raised concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster.",
      "Planes and helicopters all have a flashing lights and typically at least one red anti-collision light, often two. They also sport navigation lights, which are steady, red and green colored lights like the ones found on boats. Many will also have flashing white strobe lights at their wingtips. And they have bright landing lights.",
      "Drones flying at night are only required to have one bright, anti-collision light that's visible 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. But drone owners can add other lights, so some have more than one. Drones are smaller, so when they have multiple lights they are close together, but at night it's often not possible to figure out precisely how far away they are.",
      "\"A light is just a bright point,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it might be 100 yards (90 meters) away, it could be literally 40 miles (65 kilometers) away and it looks the same.\u201d",
      "Drones tend to be quieter and make a more high-pitched buzzing noise than what's generated by the jet engines or propellers that drive planes and helicopters. But bigger drones can be louder, and the sound may be difficult to discern from a distance.",
      "Drones heavier than about a half-pound (0.2 kilograms) may have an identifying number displayed on the outside.",
      "\u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t see it at night, and you\u2019d have to be up close to see it, you know, in the daytime,\u201d said Paul R. Snyder, director of the Unmanned Aircraft System program in the University of North Dakota's Aerospace Sciences School.",
      "Planes and even helicopters tend to move smoothly in the air, but multi-copter drones can stop on a dime, pivot 90 degrees and reverse course, Slaughter said.",
      "\u201cThat kind of motion can give you a clue that you\u2019re looking at a drone, not an aircraft,\" he said.",
      "And the vast majority of drones will be operating below 400 feet (122 meters), following federal regulations."

    "story": [
      "Former talk show host Carlos Watson has been sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison in the federal financial conspiracy case surrounding his once-buzzy Ozy Media",
      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",
      "U.S. District Judge Eric Komitee said Monday that the \u201cquantum of dishonesty in this case is exceptional.\u201d",
      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax.",
      "There's no parallel between faking blood test results and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "Only one of those investors spoke at the sentencing \u2014 Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "TikTok is asking the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agrees to sell it",
      "WASHINGTON -- TikTok on Monday asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to block the federal law that would ban the popular platform in the United States unless its China-based parent company agreed to sell it.",
      "Lawyers for the company and China-based ByteDance urged the justices to step in before the law's Jan. 19 deadline. A similar plea was filed by content creators who rely on the platform for income and some of TikTok's more than 170 million users in the U.S.",
      "\u201cA modest delay in enforcing the Act will create breathing room for this Court to conduct an orderly review and the new Administration to evaluate this matter \u2014 before this vital channel for Americans to communicate with their fellow citizens and the world is closed,\u201d lawyers for the companies told the Supreme Court.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who once supported a ban but then pledged during the campaign to \u201csave TikTok,\u201d said his administration would take a look at the situation.",
      "\u201cAs you know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His campaign saw the platform as a way to reach younger, less politically engaged voters.",
      "Trump was meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, according to two people familiar with the president-elect\u2019s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.",
      "The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.",
      "On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.",
      "The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.",
      "Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect Jan. 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.",
      "It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that Trump's Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences. Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.",
      "The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that the justices can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues. They also could quickly schedule arguments and try to render a decision by Jan. 19.",
      "On the other hand, the high court could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.",
      "With that last prospect in mind, the companies' lawyers asked for a ruling on their emergency request by Jan. 6 because they'd need the time \u201cto coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States.\u201d",
      "The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April.",

      "Claudia Lin, an online dating detective in the age of AI, is hunting once again through a dark cybersphere of tech systems in \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d the second novel in a new mystery series by Jane Pek.",
      "Pek, who introduced Claudia in her 2022 debut book, \u201cThe Verifiers,\u201d has given the mystery genre fresh trappings \u2014 a vivid New York City landscape of chatbots and apps that can create chaos or sniff out fraud, and a delightfully plucky new sleuth, who is in her mid-20s, Asian American and gay.",
      "In \u201cThe Rivals,\u201d Claudia and Becks Rittel are the co-owners of the fact-checking firm Veracity. It\u2019s a tiny business \u2014 it only has one other employee, the unkempt gamer Squirrel \u2014 but helps clients of giant matchmaking platforms make sure the strangers they meet for dates are not unscrupulous liars or worse.",
      "\u201cThe Rivals\u201d opens with a couple of customers from online meet-up sites seeking different kinds of assistance. One wants Veracity to make sure his new lady friend, the charming Amalia Suarez, is all she claims to be; the other, Pradeep Mehta, anxiously asks for help taking down a false online gay-dating profile that could ruin his life.",
      "Claudia takes on both projects, despite Becks\u2019 protests and disparagement. A curt, tough-minded colleague in her mid-30s, Becks is nicknamed the \u201cBlonde Assassin.\u201d In short order, both cases present Claudia with false turns, odd developments and scary possibilities. These twists make \u201cThe Rivals\u201d a modern mystery unfolding amid synthetic culprits \u2014 cyberworld bots known as \u201csynths\u201d \u2014 that can wreck real lives.",
      "Pek adds a few vital human ingredients to the story\u2019s digital mix. One is Claudia\u2019s striving but dysfunctional family. Her siblings, Charles and Coraline, and their irritable mother are introduced in an early chapter as they gather in the West Village for a meal celebrating the Chinese New Year. Coraline\u2019s beau is there, too. Their father is out of the picture. A celebration the meal is not, but the Lin family fracas adds sparks to the narrative throughout.",
      "Pek also makes neighborhoods and go-to sites of Manhattan, Brooklyn and other city environs an integral and appealing part of the story. Claudia, for example, plays Ultimate frisbee in Prospect Park and takes the reader on her many rendezvous, from the touristy High Line to a bike path through Fort Washington Park.",
      "Claudia\u2019s sexuality is not a central tug-of-war plot issue. But it does give an edgy lift to the story line when Claudia, as the novel\u2019s narrator, notes the inner romantic tingles set off in her by others.",
      "Pek writes with wit and AI savvy. At times \u201cThe Rivals\u201d unfolds with so much tech-heavy dialogue that it can be hard to follow. But Claudia is a winning new entry in the field of modern serial detectives. \u201cThe Rivals\u201d hints that she has more work in store. With the freshness of Pek\u2019s staging of online love and death, a third entry in the series will be welcome.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Senate committee says at least two internal Amazon studies have found a relationship between worker speed and injuries in the online retailer's warehouses",
      "At least two internal Amazon studies found a link between how quickly the online retailer's warehouse workers perform tasks and workplace injuries, but the company rejected many safety recommendations out of concern the proposed changes might reduce productivity, according to a U.S. Senate committee report.",
      "The 160-page review issued Sunday night was compiled by the Democratic majority staff of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The report is the final product of a probe into Amazon\u2019s warehouse safety practices that U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders initiated last year.",
      "The Vermont independent, a frequent critic of Amazon who chairs the panel, released an interim report in July that featured some findings from the investigation. The final report, which was mostly based on interviews with nearly 500 former and current Amazon workers, included more details, such as the two internal studies and the reactions they received inside the company.",
      "Amazon pushed back on the findings Monday, saying in a blog post that Sanders \u201ccontinues to mislead the American public\u201d about the company's safety practices and that the report was \u201cwrong on the facts and features selective, outdated information that lacks context and isn\u2019t grounded in reality.\"",
      "The Senate report said Amazon launched an internal study in 2021 to determine the maximum number of times a warehouse worker could perform the same physical tasks without increased risk of harm and potentially developing musculoskeletal disorders.",
      "The team conducting the Amazon study, known as Project Elderwand, focused on workers who picked items from robotic shelf units. The study concluded that the \u201clikelihood of back injury increases\" along with the number of items picked and identified an upper limit on repetitive movements - 1,940 - per 10-hour shift, the report said.",
      "The study recommended using software to implement breaks \u201caccording to each worker's rate.\u201d It suggested expanding an existing Amazon program that recommended \u201cmicrobreaks\u201d and making them mandatory for employees who worked above the maximum pace.",
      "The team stated that the success of a mini pilot program to test out its idea would be conditional on \u201cany negative impact to the (workers) or customer experience,\u201d according to documents cited in the committee report.",
      "Ultimately, Amazon did not make changes to reduce repetitive worker movements, the report said. The company told the Senate committee it chose not to do so due to \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d involving the proposed software program, the report said.",
      "Amazon also said in its blog post that the Project Elderwand pilot program showed the study team's suggested intervention was \u201cineffective.\"",
      "Amazon previously had undertaken another study, known as Project Soteria, in 2020 to identify risk factors for injuries and recommend policy changes that would improve worker safety. The multi-team initiative studied two policies Amazon implemented temporarily during the COVID-19 pandemic - giving workers more time off and pausing disciplinary measures \u201cfor workers who failed to meet speed requirements,\u201d the report said.",
      "The study found that both policies lowered injury risks and asked for their permanent adoption.",
      "But company leaders denied the request, saying it might \u201cnegatively impact\u201d productivity, according to Amazon documents cited in the Senate committee report. Amazon leaders also changed the focus of the Project Soteria study by telling the people conducting the review to provide recommendations on how to improve productivity without worsening worker injuries, the report said.",
      "Amazon disputed the report's characterization of the events.",
      "\u201cProject Soteria is an example of this type of team evaluation, where one team explored whether there\u2019s a causal link between pace of work and injuries and another team evaluated the methodology and findings and determined they weren\u2019t valid,\u201d Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a written statement.",
      "Nantel also said that information about Project Soteria was raised in a Washington state worker safety case in which Amazon was accused of four safety violations. A judge assigned to the case ruled in Amazon's favor in July. Regulators are appealing the ruling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that the senator chose to ignore the facts and all of this context,\u201d Nantel said.",
      "The Senate committee report also alleged that Amazon manipulates its workplace injury data to portray its warehouses as safer than they are, an allegation the company disputed.",
      "Amazon said it produced \u201cthousands of pages of information and data\u201d for the committee. The majority staff, however, said the company failed to produce documents on the connection between the pace of work and injuries.",
      "The author's of the committee report said they learned about the two internal studies from the Washington worker safety case, not Amazon. Once the committee staff members identified the studies by name, they reached out to the company, which ultimately provided the individual documents."

      "Drone-detecting devices deployed in New Jersey within the past week have shown little to no evidence of anything nefarious or threatening",
      "TRENTON, N.J. -- Drone-detecting devices deployed in New Jersey in the past week have found \u201clittle to no evidence\u201d of anything nefarious or threatening, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday as calls grew for action to address the mysterious nighttime sightings of suspected unmanned flights across the northeastern U.S.",
      "Murphy told reporters in Trenton that there were 12 sightings of suspected drones in the state on Saturday and one on Sunday. He declined to go into detail about the detection equipment, but said it was powerful enough to disable the drones, although he added that is not legal on U.S. soil.",
      "Murphy, a Democrat, echoed calls by state officials elsewhere for Congress to allow them to deal with drones. Nearly all the power now rests with the federal government.",
      "\"It is extraordinary to me that, that a nation as great as ours and as powerful as ours has the deficiencies that we have now seen in living color as it relates to drone incursions,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Federal officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, have repeatedly said there are no signs that any drone operators have shown bad intent, nor is there evidence of foreign involvement.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no question that people are seeing drones,\u201d Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. \u201cBut I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.\u201d",
      "But that hasn't reassured everyone. Conspiracy theories about foreign actors, the U.S. government and the \u201cdeep state,\u201d abound online, while elected officials concerned about threats to military bases, airports and other locations have increased their calls for federal officials to act.",
      "The skeptics include President-elect Donald Trump, who suggested Monday that \"the government knows what is happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur military knows and our president knows and for some reason they want to keep people in suspense,\u201d Trump said. He refused to say whether he had been briefed on the drone sightings.",
      "New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim, a Democrat, told The Associated Press that officials could do a better job helping the public to understand what is going on, especially when people wrongly conclude they are seeing unmanned aircraft.",
      "\u201cWhat the public could use is like walking through that rather than just, you know, as a statement that says nothing, nothing to be concerned about,\u201d he said. \"I think it\u2019s reached a level of just public attention that some greater level of depth is necessary.\u201d",
      "Kim said he\u2019s heard no supporting evidence for the president-elect's statement Monday that information is being withheld and that a lack of faith in institutions is playing a key part in the saga.",
      "\u201cNothing that I\u2019m seeing, nothing that I\u2019ve engaged in gives me any impression of that nature. But like, I get it, some people won\u2019t believe me, right? Because that\u2019s the level of distrust that we face.\u201d",
      "Over the past two days, New York and Pennsylvania officials have also requested drone-detecting equipment from federal officials.",
      "\"It is imperative our communities in Pennsylvania are protected and questions on the presence of these drones are answered,\u201d U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican, wrote in a letter to Mayorkas on Monday. \"State-of-the-art radar systems will provide insights into where these drones are deploying from and what the motives for their flights may be.\u201d",
      "After reports of drones in Connecticut, state police said they were monitoring drone activity and state officials said analysts were comparing reported sightings with federal flight data.",
      "\u201cOne of the drone sightings had the word Frontier on the back, that was an airline,\u201d Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, said Monday. \u201cBut some of them are big and unexplained and we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of this. Right now, what we do is we make sure that our security and airports are secure.\u201d",
      "At a media briefing on Monday, the Pentagon's press secretary, Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, said defense officials have seen no indication that the drones flying over multiple locations in the U.S. are being controlled by a foreign country. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, he said, there are approximately 1 million registered drones in the U.S. and about 8,000 are flying any given day.",
      "Ryder said that while military bases overseas can use surveillance methods that quickly address the origin of drones, that power is limited in U.S. airspace because of domestic surveillance laws. He said most drones are operated through either radio frequency transmissions or satellite-guided GPS navigation, which can provide information about the operators. If they're not controlled by those methods, that's another clue, he said.",
      "\u201cSo I\u2019m kind of talking around it because I don\u2019t necessarily want to get into talking classified capabilities, but the bottom line is that all of that gives us an idea that, hey, these are not foreign origin,\" Ryder said.",
      "Christopher Stadulis, a retired New York City firefighter and drone hobbyist, said he's seen clusters of drones near his home in Clinton Township, New Jersey. He said the lights he has seen at night are different from those used by commercial airlines, and the drones he has seen are very large.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at what I\u2019m seeing with the naked eye, you can see it\u2019s not a normal aircraft,\u201d he said in a recent interview. \"This and we don\u2019t have this much traffic, you know, usually on any given night in this area. So it seems like definitely some of them are aircraft that we can\u2019t explain what they are.\u201d",
      "More suspected drone sightings over the weekend led to a temporary airspace shutdown at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton, Ohio, for about four hours late Friday into Saturday, and the arrests of two men in Boston accused of flying a drone \u201cdangerously close\u201d to Logan International Airport.",
      "U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, said Monday that he is introducing legislation calling on federal officials to provide public briefings on what they know about the drones and calling for a drone air traffic control system similar to those used for planes. He also wants law enforcement to be given access to drone detectors and the authority to \u201ctake out drones that shouldn't be in the air.\"",
      "\u201cI believe the people I represent and, as I\u2019ve been saying for some time now, the people in New Jersey and around the country deserve answers,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThey deserve transparency from their government.\u201d",

      "Instead of being a youthful 400 million years old as commonly thought, the icy, shimmering rings could be around 4.5 billion years old just like Saturn, a Japanese-led team reported Monday.",
      "The scientists surmise Saturn\u2019s rings may be pristine not because they are young but because they are dirt-resistant.",
      "Saturn's rings are long thought to be between 100 million and 400 million years old based on more than a decade of observations by NASA's Cassini spacecraft before its demise in 2017.",
      "Images by Cassini showed no evidence of any darkening of the rings by impacting micrometeoroids \u2014 space rock particles smaller than a grain of sand \u2014 prompting scientists to conclude the rings formed long after the planet.",
      "Through computer modeling, the Institute of Science Tokyo's Ryuki Hyodo and his team demonstrated that micrometeoroids vaporize once slamming into the rings, with little if any dark and dirty residue left behind. They found that the resulting charged particles get sucked toward Saturn or out into space, keeping the rings spotless and challenging the baby rings theory. Their results appear in the journal Nature Geoscience.",
      "Hyodo said it's possible Saturn's rings could be somewhere between the two extreme ages \u2014 around the halfway mark of 2.25 billion years old. But the solar system was much more chaotic during its formative years with large planetary-type objects migrating and interacting all over the place, just the sort of scenario that would be conducive to producing Saturn's rings.",

      "Reliance on school buses has been waning for years as districts struggle to find drivers and more students attend schools far outside their neighborhoods",
      "CHICAGO -- Ismael El-Amin was driving his daughter to school when a chance encounter gave him an idea for a new way to carpool.",
      "On the way across Chicago, El-Amin\u2019s daughter spotted a classmate riding with her own dad as they drove to their selective public school on the city\u2019s North Side. For 40 minutes, they rode along the same congested highway.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re waving to each other in the back. I\u2019m looking at the dad. The dad\u2019s looking at me. And I was like, parents can definitely be a resource to parents,\u201d said El-Amin, who went on to found Piggyback Network, a service parents can use to book rides for their children.",
      "Reliance on school buses has been waning for years as districts struggle to find drivers and more students attend schools far outside their neighborhoods. As responsibility for transportation shifts to families, the question of how to replace the traditional yellow bus has become an urgent problem for some, and a spark for innovation.",
      "State and local governments decide how widely to offer school bus service. Lately, more have been cutting back. Only about 28% of U.S. students take a school bus, according to a Federal Highway Administration survey concluded early last year. That\u2019s down from about 36% in 2017.",
      "Chicago Public Schools, the nation\u2019s fourth-largest district, has significantly curbed bus service in recent years. It still offers rides for disabled and homeless students, in line with a federal mandate, but most families are on their own. Only 17,000 of the district\u2019s 325,000 students are eligible for school bus rides.",
      "Last week, the school system launched a pilot program allowing some students who attend out-of-neighborhood magnet or selective-enrollment schools to catch a bus at a nearby school\u2019s \u201chub stop.\u201d It aims to start with rides for about 1,000 students by the end of the school year.",
      "It\u2019s not enough to make up for the lost service, said Erin Rose Schubert, a volunteer for the CPS Parents for Buses advocacy group.",
      "\u201cThe people who had the money and the privilege were able to figure out other situations like rearranging their work schedules or public transportation,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who didn\u2019t, some had to pull their kids out of school.\u201d",
      "On Piggyback Network, parents can book a ride for their student online with another parent traveling the same direction. Rides cost roughly 80 cents per mile and the drivers are compensated with credits to use for their own kids\u2019 rides.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for kids to not be late to school,\u201d 15-year-old Takia Phillips said on a recent PiggyBack ride with El-Amin as the driver.",
      "The company has arranged a few hundred rides in its first year operating in Chicago, and El-Amin has been contacting drivers for possible expansion to Virginia, North Carolina and Texas. It is one of several startups that have been filling the void.",
      "Unlike Piggyback Network, which connects parents, HopSkipDrive contracts directly with school districts to assist students without reliable transportation. The company launched a decade ago in Los Angeles with three mothers trying to coordinate school carpools and now supports some 600 school districts in 13 states.",
      "Regulations keep it from operating in some states, including Kentucky, where a group of Louisville students has been lobbying on its behalf to change that.",
      "After the district halted bus service to most traditional and magnet schools, the student group known as The Real Young Prodigys wrote a hip-hop song titled \u201cWhere My Bus At?\u201d The song\u2019s music video went viral on YouTube with lyrics such as, \u201cI\u2019m a good kid. I stay in class, too. Teachers want me to succeed, but I can\u2019t get to school.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose bus driver shortages are not really going away,\u201d HopSkipDrive CEO Joanna McFarland said. \u201cThis is a structural change in the industry we need to get serious about addressing.\u201d",
      "HopSkipDrive has been a welcome option for Reinya Gibson\u2019s son, Jerren Samuel, who attends a small high school in Oakland, California. She said the school takes care to accommodate his needs as a student with autism, but the district lined up the transportation because there is no bus from their home in San Leandro.",
      "\u201cGrowing up, people used to talk about kids in the short yellow buses. They were associated with a physical disability, and they were teased or made fun of,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cNobody knows this is support for Jerren because he can\u2019t take public transportation.\u201d",
      "Encouragement from his mother helped Jerren overcame his fear about riding with a stranger to school.",
      "\u201cI felt really independent getting in that car,\u201d he said.",
      "Companies catering to kids claim to screen drivers more extensively, checking their fingerprints and requiring them to have childcare or parenting experience. Drivers and children are often given passwords that must match, and parents can track a child\u2019s whereabouts in real time through the apps.",
      "Kango, a competitor to HopSkipDrive in California and Arizona, started as a free carpooling app similar to the PiggyBack Network and now contracts with school districts. Drivers are paid more than they would typically get for Uber or Lyft, but there are often more requirements such as walking some students with disabilities into school, Kango CEO Sara Schaer said.",
      "\u201cThis is not just a curbside-to-curbside, three-minute situation,\u201d Schaer said. \u201cYou are responsible for getting that kid to and from school. That\u2019s not the same as transporting an adult or DoorDashing somebody\u2019s lunch or dinner.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, some families that have used Piggyback said they have seen few alternatives.",
      "Concerned about the city\u2019s rising crime rate, retired police officer Sabrina Beck never considered letting her son take the subway to Whitney Young High School. Since she was driving him anyway, she volunteered through PiggyBack also to drive a freshman who had qualified for the selective magnet school but had no way to get there.",
      "\u201cTo have the opportunity to go and then to miss it because you don\u2019t have the transportation, that is so detrimental,\u201d Beck said. \u201cOptions like this are extremely important.\u201d",
      "After the bus route that took her two kids to elementary school was canceled, Jazmine Dillard and other Chicago parents thought they had convinced the school to move up the opening bell from 8:45 a.m. to 8:15 a.m., a more manageable time for her schedule. After that plan was scrapped because the buses were needed elsewhere at that time, Dillard turned to PiggyBack Network.",

      "The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The new year will usher in the bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses that, together, could push states to become more open to crypto and for public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it.",
      "Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.",
      "Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to criticize government-backed currencies as prone to devaluation and say increased government buy-in will stabilize bitcoin's future price swings, give it more legitimacy and further boost an already rising price.",
      "But the risks are significant. Critics say a crypto investment is highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting its future returns, and warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.",
      "Only a couple public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency and a new U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued in recent days, warned it has \u201cuniquely high volatility\u201d and that it found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.",
      "It has already been a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin hitting $100,000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approving the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and crypto enthusiasts being cheered by Trump's promise to make the United States the \u201cbitcoin superpower\u201d of the world.",
      "Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills in 2025 to make them crypto-friendly as analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby, bitcoin miners build new installations and venture capitalists underwrite a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies.",
      "Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback.",
      "A bill introduced last month in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir.",
      "\u201cI had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,\u201d said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell.",
      "Cabell \u2014 a bitcoin enthusiast who lost his reelection bid \u2014 expects his bill to be reintroduced by a colleague. And leaders of bitcoin advocacy group Satoshi Action say they expect bills based on their model bill to be introduced in at least 10 other states next year.",
      "Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn\u2019t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto.",
      "Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek.",
      "\u201cThere might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,\u201d Brainard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.\u201d",
      "In Louisiana, Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system by which people can pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies.",
      "Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather sees the step as a recognition that government must innovate and be flexible in helping people make financial transactions with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto.",
      "Fleming recalled meeting with a bitcoin lobbyist recently and came away unconvinced that bitcoin makes for a good investment.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that at some point it\u2019ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cAnd when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.\u201d",
      "In Pennsylvania, Treasury Department officials said they have the authority to decide for themselves if cryptocurrencies meet the agency's investment standards under state law and don't need new legislation.",
      "Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said.",
      "Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin.",
      "That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York.",
      "Pension boards got investment tools they like this year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and, in October, approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said.",
      "Many \u201care likely in the process of getting up to speed on what it means to invest in bitcoin and kicking the tires, so to speak, and that\u2019s a process that typically takes a while at the institutional level,\u201d Palmer said.",
      "Several major asset managers like BlackRock, Invesco and Fidelity have bitcoin ETFs.",
      "In May, the State of Wisconsin Investment Board became the first state to invest when it bought $160 million worth of shares in two ETFs, or about 0.1% of its assets. It later scaled back that investment to $104 million in one ETF, as of Sept. 30. A spokesperson declined to discuss it.",
      "Michigan's state investment board later reported about $18 million in bitcoin ETF purchases while a candidate for New Jersey governor, Steven Fulop, said that if elected he would push the state's pension fund to invest in crypto.",
      "Fulop, the Democratic mayor of Jersey City, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan, has been preparing for months to buy bitcoin ETF shares for up to 2% of the city's $250 million employee pension fund.",
      "\u201cWe were ahead of the curve,\" Fulop said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re eventually going to see is this is widely accepted, with regard to exposure in all pension funds, some sort of exposure.\u201d",

      "Sen. Chuck Schumer called Sunday for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to deploy better drone-tracking technology to identify the drones and their operators.",
      "\u201cNew Yorkers have tremendous questions about it,\u201d Schumer, the Senate majority leader, told reporters about the drone sightings. \u201cWe are going to get the answers for them.\u201d",
      "The federal government did little to answer those questions in its own media briefings Sunday morning. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that people are seeing drones,\u201d U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. \u201cBut I want to assure the American public that we are on it. We are working in close coordination with state and local authorities.\u201d",
      "Some of the drones reported above parts of New York and New Jersey have turned out to be \u201cmanned aircraft that are commonly mistaken for drones,\u201d Mayorkas said. \u201cWe know of no foreign involvement with respect to the sightings in the Northeast. And we are vigilant in investigating this matter.\u201d",
      "Last year, federal aviation rules began requiring certain drones to broadcast their remote identification, including the location of their operators. It\u2019s not clear whether that information has been used to determine who is behind the drones plaguing locations over New York and New Jersey. Mayorkas\u2019 office didn\u2019t respond to questions about whether they\u2019ve been able to identify drones using this capability.",
      "Schumer wants the federal government to use a recently declassified radio wave technology in New York and New Jersey. The radio wave detector can be attached to a drone or airplane and can determine whether another flying object is a bird or a drone, read its electronic registration, and follow it back to its landing place. Schumer said state and local authorities do not have the authority to track drones.",
      "On Sunday, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said federal officials were sending a drone detection system to the state.",
      "\u201cThis system will support state and federal law enforcement in their investigations,\u201d Hochul said in a statement. The governor did not immediately provide additional details, including where the system will be deployed.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month over parts of New Jersey, raising concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified.",
      "Drones are now being reported all along the northern East Coast, with suspicious sightings in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Virginia, according to news reports.",
      "Some U.S. political leaders, including Trump, have called for much stronger action against the drones, including shooting them down.",
      "Certain agencies within the Department of Homeland Security have the power to \u201cincapacitate\u201d drones, Mayorkas said Sunday. \u201cBut we need those authorities expanded,\u201d he said.",
      "A bill before the U.S. Senate would enhance some federal agencies\u2019 authority and give new abilities to local and state agencies to track drones. It would also start a pilot program allowing states and local authorities to disrupt, disable or seize a drone without prior consent of the operator.",
      "\u201cWhat the drone issue points out are gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department,\" Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., Trump\u2019s pick to be his national security adviser, said on CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. \"Americans are finding it hard to believe we can\u2019t figure out where these are coming from.\u2019\u2019",

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Donald Trump hosted Apple CEO Tim Cook for a Friday evening dinner at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort, according to a person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to comment publicly.",
      "Cook is the latest in a string of big tech leaders \u2014 including OpenAI's Sam Altman, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 who have sought to improve their standing with the incoming president after choppy relations with Trump during his first term.",
      "Trump has said he has spoken with Cook about the company's long-running tax battles with the European Union.",
      "The meeting comes less than two months after Trump said he spoke to Cook by phone, and soon after Apple lost its last appeal in a dispute with the EU over 13 billion euros ($14.34 billion) in back taxes to Ireland.",
      "\u201cHe said the European Union has just fined us $15 billion,\" Trump recalled of his conversation with Cook, in an October interview with podcaster Patrick Bet-David. \"Then on top of that they got fined by the European Union another $2 billion.\"",
      "The decision by the EU top court was the finale to a dispute that centered on sweetheart deals that Dublin was offering to attract multinational businesses with minimal taxes across the 27-nation bloc. The European Commission in 2016 ruled that Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid that Ireland was required to recover.",
      "Trump's transition team and Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment about his dinner with Cook.",
      "OpenAI CEO Altman is planning to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, the company confirmed Friday. Amazon and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, confirmed this week they had each donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "During his first term, Trump criticized Amazon and railed against the political coverage at The Washington Post, which Bezos owns. Meanwhile, Bezos had criticized some of Trump\u2019s past rhetoric. In 2019, Amazon also argued in a court case that Trump\u2019s bias against the company harmed its chances of winning a $10 billion Pentagon contract.",
      "More recently, Bezos has struck a more conciliatory tone. Last week, he said at The New York Times\u2019 DealBook Summit in New York that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d about Trump\u2019s second term while also endorsing president-elect\u2019s plans to cut regulations.",
      "The donation from Meta came just weeks after Meta CEO Zuckerberg met with Trump privately at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "During the 2024 campaign, Zuckerberg did not endorse a candidate for president, but voiced a more positive stance toward Trump. Earlier this year, he praised Trump\u2019s response to his first assassination attempt."

      "A federal appeals court on Friday left in place a mid-January deadline in a federal law requiring TikTok to be sold or face a ban in the United States, rejecting a request made by the company to halt enforcement until the Supreme Court reviews its challenge of the statute.",
      "Attorneys for TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, are expected to appeal to the Supreme Court.",
      "It\u2019s unclear if the nation's highest court will take up the case, though some legal experts have said they expect the justices to weigh in due to the types of novel questions it raises about social media, national security and the First Amendment. TikTok is also looking for a potential lifeline from President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \u201csave\u201d the short-form video platform during the presidential campaign.",
      "Attorneys for TikTok and ByteDance had requested the injunction after a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit sided with the U.S. government and rejected their challenge to the law.",
      "The court rejected that request on Friday, calling it \u201cunwarranted.\"",
      "\u201cThe petitioners have not identified any case in which a court, after rejecting a constitutional challenge to an Act of Congress, has enjoined the Act from going into effect while review is sought in the Supreme Court,\u201d said the court's order, which was unsigned.",
      "The statute, which was signed by President Joe Biden earlier this year, requires ByteDance to sell TikTok to an approved buyer due to national security concerns or face a ban in the U.S.",
      "The U.S. has said it sees TikTok as a national security risk because ByteDance could be coerced by Chinese authorities to hand over U.S. user data or manipulate content on the platform for Beijing\u2019s interests. TikTok has denied those claims and has argued that the government\u2019s case rests on hypothetical future risks instead of proven facts.",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:10:27 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Right now chestnut enthusiasts are cozying up next to their open fires (or toaster ovens) to roast a holiday snack that has long roots in North America",
      "It's been a very long time since vendors sold the American chestnut on city sidewalks. It's no longer the variety whose smell some people associate with Christmastime as it wafts from street carts. Because it's virtually extinct.",
      "But memories of the American chestnut's legacy keep resurfacing for the researchers who want to bring it back. They describe its wood that paneled the homes and schoolrooms of their grandparents, or the photographs of men on the street corners of old Baltimore, with hot bags of nuts cooked on charcoal.",
      "\u201cYou can feel that connection to a place, and that connection to utility, and the connection to the importance that this tree played in virtually every aspect of the lives of people,\u201d said Sara Fern Fitzsimmons, chief conservation officer with The American Chestnut Foundation, which is working to restore the tree to flourish as it once did.",
      "Fitzsimmons said that will likely take a lot longer than many chestnut enthusiasts had hoped. Researchers have hit roadblocks with attempts to breed or genetically modify a version that can withstand the invasive blight that has hammered the species since the early 1900s. If and when they do find the right variety, they'll need to figure out how to plant it and help it thrive in forests that are under pressure from climate change, globalization and development.",
      "Once a hallmark of forests from Georgia to New England, American chestnuts now exist mostly as a vast network of root systems underground, sending up shoots. They grow for a time, but the fungal blight takes hold when the trees start maturing. East Asian varieties, like those that introduced the blight in the first place, are immune to the blight, and produce most of the edible chestnuts for fall and winter snacking.",
      "Still, American chestnut trees are better suited for timber, they're culturally loved by people all over North America and they used to be an important species for the ecological health of forests, providing a reliable source of nutritious food and shelter for wildlife and humans alike. \u201cIt was really a pretty significant species to lose,\u201d said Amy Brunner, an associate professor at Virginia Tech who works on the tree's genetics. \u201cThe more diversity you lose, the less resilient that forest ecosystem is.\u201d",
      "The American Chestnut Foundation, among others, has been trying for decades to breed a hybrid that is mostly American in genetics but with the fungus-fighting traits of the Chinese type. Fitzsimmons said breeders have learned just how difficult that is \u2014 blight resistance involves several different genes and it has proven hard to separate them from the traits that distinguish Chinese chestnuts.",
      "To speed the process, some scientists have been working on genetically modifying American chestnuts to see if they can boost their immunity that way instead. But progress was delayed by a recent mix-up involving two versions of a genetically modified American chestnut that scientists at State University of New York had hoped could get through the regulatory process as soon as this year.",
      "\u201cIt kind of stinks that it happened because now it\u2019s taking a little bit longer than we had hoped,\" said Linda McGuigan, a research support specialist at the university. But scientists there and elsewhere are continuing to pursue many avenues.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think you will get there, to all you desire, without both,\u201d Brunner said, referring to the two main methods of breeding and genetic modification. Breeding is vital for achieving enough genetic diversity for trees to adapt to a changing world, she said, but added that she thinks some genetic manipulation will be needed to get to enough blight resistance for American chestnuts to stand a chance.",
      "Meanwhile, other scientists are working on projects to tackle another big challenge ahead for chestnuts: where to plant them. If a successful tree is cobbled together with genes taken from trees from Tennessee to New York, where would it have the best chance at surviving, given how a warming planet is changing habitat around the world?",
      "A team at Virginia Tech published a paper this summer to try to answer that question. They looked at 32 climate variables and compared them to projected future climates, then calculated the shortest distance that regionally specific American chestnuts would have to move to offset warming. The idea was to one day help them survive a new climate while keeping them as close as possible to where they once thrived.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hyperbolic to say it\u2019s revolutionary\" for teams at The American Chestnut Foundation, said Fitzsimmons, who contributed data to the project. She said the project will help them better figure out where to collect genes from the immature trees that remain across the country.",
      "Tom Kimmerer, a forest scientist who taught at the University of Kentucky, is working on a book about trees including the American chestnut. Kimmerer, who was not involved in the research, called it \u201crobust and well supported\u201d and \u201ccritically important to the success of the chestnut.\u201d",
      "Stacy Clark, a research forester at the U.S. Forest Service, said the findings are useful, but added that they need to be backed up with real-world experiments. \u201cI think with advancements in genetics, they can probably get pretty fast data off of those field trials. But still, all of that takes time and effort, right?\"",
      "For now, forest scientists know their work might not pay off in their lifetimes. It's a lesson that became clear for the community when pioneering chestnut restoration experts Bill Powell and Chuck Maynard both died in the past 13 months. McGuigan supported both of their research for years as lab manager at SUNY's college of environmental science and forestry.",
      "\u201cThe project moves on, lives on. And we honor their memory,\u201d McGuigan said. \u201cI want to do something good for the future, for my children.\"",

      "CHATHAM, N.J. -- That buzzing coming out of New Jersey? It's unclear if it's drones or something else, but for sure the nighttime sightings are producing tons of talk, a raft of conspiracy theories and craned necks looking skyward.",
      "Cropping up on local news and social media sites around Thanksgiving, the saga of the drones reported over New Jersey has reached incredible heights.",
      "This week seems to have begun a new, higher-profile chapter: Lawmakers are demanding (but so far not getting) explanations from federal and state authorities about what's behind them. Gov. Phil Murphy wrote to President Joe Biden asking for answers. New Jersey's new senator, Andy Kim, spent Thursday night on a drone hunt in rural northern New Jersey, and posted about it on X.",
      "More drone sightings have been reported in New York City, and Mayor Eric Adams says the city is investigating and collaborating with New Jersey and federal officials. And then President-elect Donald Trump posted that he believes the government knows more than it\u2019s saying. \u201cLet the public know, and now. Otherwise, shoot them down!!!\" he posted on his social media site.",
      "But perhaps the most fantastic development is the dizzying proliferation of conspiracies, none of which has been confirmed or suggested by federal and state officials who say they're looking into what's happening. It has become shorthand to refer to the flying machines as drones, but there are questions about whether what people are seeing are unmanned aircraft or something else.",
      "Some theorize the drones came from an Iranian mothership. Others think they are the Secret Service making sure President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Bedminster property is secure. Others worry about China. The deep state. And on.",
      "In the face of uncertainty, people have done what they do in 2024: Create a social media group.",
      "The Facebook page, New Jersey Mystery Drones \u2014 let\u2019s solve it, has nearly 44,000 members, up from 39,000 late Thursday. People are posting their photo and video sightings, and the online commenters take it from there.",
      "One video shows a whitish light flying in a darkened sky, and one commenter concludes it\u2019s otherworldly. \u201cStraight up orbs,\u201d the person says. Others weigh in to say it\u2019s a plane or maybe a satellite. Another group called for hunting the drones literally, shooting them down like turkeys. (Do not shoot at anything in the sky, experts warn.)",
      "Trisha Bushey, 48, of Lebanon Township, New Jersey, lives near Round Valley Reservoir where there have been numerous sightings. She said she first posted photos online last month wondering what the objects were and became convinced they were drones when she saw how they moved and when her son showed her on a flight tracking site that no planes were around. Now she's glued to the Mystery Drones page, she said.",
      "\u201cI find myself \u2014 instead of Christmas shopping or cleaning my house \u2014 checking it,\u201d she said.",
      "She doesn't buy what the governor said, that the drones aren't a risk to public safety. Murphy told Biden on Friday that residents need answers. The federal Homeland Security Department and FBI also said in a joint statement they have no evidence that the sightings pose \u201ca national security\u202for public safety\u202fthreat or have a foreign nexus.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow can you say it\u2019s not posing a threat if you don\u2019t know what it is?\u201d she said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why so many people are uneasy.\u201d",
      "Then there's the notion that people could misunderstand what they're seeing. William Austin is the president of Warren County Community College, which has a drone technology degree program, and is coincidentally located in one of the sighting hotspots.",
      "Austin says he has looked at videos of purported drones and that airplanes are being misidentified as drones. He cited an optical effect called parallax, which is the apparent shift of an object when viewed from different perspectives. Austin encouraged people to download flight and drone tracker apps so they can better understand what they're looking at.",
      "Nonetheless, people continue to come up with their own theories.",
      "\u201cIt represents the United States of America in 2024,\u201d Austin said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost trust in our institutions, and we need it.\u201d",
      "Federal officials echo Austin's view that many of the sightings are piloted aircraft such as planes and helicopters being mistaken for drones, according to lawmakers and Murphy.",
      "That's not really convincing for many, though, who are homing in on the sightings beyond just New Jersey and the East Coast, where others have reported seeing the objects.",
      "For Seph Divine, 34, another member of the drone hunting group who lives in Eugene, Oregon, it feels as if it\u2019s up to citizen sleuths to solve the mystery. He said he tries to be a voice of reason, encouraging people to fact check their information, while also asking probing questions.",
      "\u201cMy main goal is I don\u2019t want people to be caught up in the hysteria and I also want people to not just ignore it at the same time,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhether or not it\u2019s foreign military or some secret access program or something otherworldly, whatever it is, all I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s alarming that this is happening so suddenly and so consistently for hours at a time,\u201d he added.",

      "A 7-year-old rivalry between tech leaders Elon Musk and Sam Altman over who should run OpenAI and best avoid an artificial intelligence \u2018dictatorship\u2019 is now heading to a federal judge",
      "A 7-year-old rivalry between tech leaders Elon Musk and Sam Altman over who should run OpenAI and prevent an artificial intelligence \"dictatorship\" is now heading to a federal judge as Musk seeks to halt the ChatGPT maker's ongoing shift into a for-profit company.",
      "Musk, an early OpenAI investor and board member, sued the artificial intelligence company earlier this year alleging it had betrayed its founding aims as a nonprofit research lab benefiting the public good rather than pursuing profits.",
      "Musk has since escalated the dispute, adding new claims and asking for a court order that would stop OpenAI\u2019s plans to convert itself into a for-profit business more fully.",
      "The world's richest man, whose companies include Tesla, SpaceX and social media platform X, last year started his own rival AI company, xAI. Musk says it faces unfair competition from OpenAI and its close business partner Microsoft, which has supplied the huge computing resources needed to build AI systems such as ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cOpenAI and Microsoft together exploiting Musk\u2019s donations so they can build a for-profit monopoly, one now specifically targeting xAI, is just too much,\u201d says Musk's filing that alleges the companies are violating the terms of Musk\u2019s foundational contributions to the charity.",
      "OpenAI filed a response Friday opposing Musk\u2019s requested order, saying it would \u201cdebilitate OpenAI\u2019s business\u201d and mission to the advantage of Musk and his own AI company and is based on \u201cfar-fetched\u201d legal claims. A hearing is set for January before U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, California.",
      "At the heart of the dispute is a 2017 internal power struggle at the fledgling startup that led to Altman becoming OpenAI's CEO.",
      "Musk also sought to be CEO and in an email outlined a plan where he would \u201cunequivocally have initial control of the company\u201d but said that would be temporary. He grew frustrated after two other OpenAI co-founders said he would hold too much power as a major shareholder and chief executive if the startup succeeded in its goal to achieve better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI. Musk has long voiced concerns about how advanced forms of AI could threaten humanity.",
      "\u201cThe current structure provides you with a path where you end up with unilateral absolute control over the AGI,\" said a 2017 email to Musk from co-founders Ilya Sutskever and Greg Brockman. \u201cYou stated that you don't want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you've shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you.\u201d",
      "In the same email, titled \u201cHonest Thoughts,\u201d Sutskever and Brockman also voiced concerns about Altman's desire to be CEO and whether he was motivated by \u201cpolitical goals.\u201d Altman eventually succeeded in becoming CEO, and has remained so except for a period last year when he was fired and then reinstated days later after the board that ousted him was replaced.",
      "OpenAI published the messages Friday in a blog post meant to show its side of the story, particularly Musk's early support for the idea of making OpenAI a for-profit business so it could raise money for the hardware and computer power that AI needs.",
      "It was Musk, through his wealth manager Jared Birchall, who first registered \u201cOpen Artificial Intelligence Technologies, Inc.,\u201d a public benefit corporation, in September 2017. Then came the \u201cHonest Thoughts\u201d email that Musk described as the \u201cfinal straw.\u201d",
      "\u201cEither go do something on your own or continue with OpenAI as a nonprofit,\u201d Musk wrote back. OpenAI said Musk later proposed merging the startup into Tesla before resigning as the co-chair of OpenAI's board in early 2018.",
      "Musk didn't respond to emailed requests for comment sent to his companies Friday.",
      "Asked about his frayed relationship with Musk at a New York Times conference last week, Altman said he felt \u201ctremendously sad\u201d but also characterized Musk\u2019s legal fight as one about business competition.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a competitor and we\u2019re doing well,\u201d Altman said. He also said at the conference that he is \u201cnot that worried\u201d about the Tesla CEO\u2019s influence with President-elect Donald Trump. OpenAI said Friday that Altman plans to make a $1 million personal donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund, joining a number of tech companies and executives who are working to improve their relationships with the incoming administration.",

      "TOMS RIVER, N.J. -- Gov. Phil Murphy has asked the Biden administration to put more resources into an investigation of mysterious drone sightings that have been reported in New Jersey and nearby states.",
      "Murphy, a Democrat, made the request in a letter Thursday, noting that state and local law enforcement remain \u201chamstrung\u201d by existing laws and policies in their efforts to successfully counteract any nefarious activity of unmanned aircraft. He posted a copy of the letter on the social media platform X.",
      "\u201cThis leaves action surrounding the (drones) squarely on the shoulders of the federal government,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cMore federal resources are needed to understand what is behind this activity.\u201d",
      "Murphy and other officials have repeatedly stressed that there is no evidence that the aircraft pose a national security or a public safety threat, or have a foreign nexus. The Pentagon also has said they are not U.S. military drones.",
      "The drones have drawn intense public concern and curiosity since residents first reported seeing them last month. Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia said from four to 180 aircraft have been reported to authorities since Nov. 18, appearing from dusk till 11 p.m.",
      "The flying objects have been spotted  near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster, but the number of reported sightings has grown greatly since then. Drones were also spotted in Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and other parts of the Mid-Atlantic region.",
      "The FBI, Federal Aviation Administration and other state and federal agencies involved in the investigation have not corroborated any of the reported sightings with electronic detection, and reviews of available images appear to show many of the reported drones are actually manned aircraft. They also say there have been no confirmed sightings in restricted air space. It\u2019s also possible that a single drone has been seen and reported more than once, officials said.",
      "Some federal lawmakers have called on the military to \u201cshoot down\u201d the drones. The drones also appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio, according to a state lawmaker who was briefed by the Department of Homeland Security.",
      "In one case, a medevac helicopter was unable to pick up a seriously injured car accident victim in Branchburg Township in Somerset County late last month due to drones hovering near the planned landing zone, according to NJ.com. The FAA said Thursday that it does not have a report on this incident.",
      "Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use but are subject to local and FAA regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified.",
      "Witnesses say the drones they think they have seen in New Jersey appear to be larger than those typically used by hobbyists."

      "A giant salamander that evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs has been proposed for federal protection by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service",
      "You never forget your first time seeing a giant salamander, according to Andy Hill.",
      "He was a teenager, standing thigh-high in the Watauga River outside Boone, North Carolina, casting a line on an early fall day when he saw his first eastern hellbender. The salamander stretched 2 feet long and was camouflaged among rocks beneath the clear water.",
      "\u201cYou never lose your sense of wonder and otherworldliness when you see one,\u201d said Hill, who now works as the Watauga Riverkeeper for MountainTrue, a nonprofit protecting natural ecosystems in western North Carolina, home to part of the Blue Ridge Mountains.",
      "The ancient species, which evolved on the supercontinent Pangaea and outlived the dinosaurs, was submitted for federal protection Friday by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. If the proposal is adopted after a period of public comment, the creatures will be protected under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Their population in the U.S. has rapidly declined in recent decades; dams, industry and even flooding worsened by climate change have threatened their habitat and ability to reproduce and find food. Today, just 12% of eastern hellbenders are successfully reproducing.",
      "Hellbenders in the Blue Ridge Mountains had been considered the healthiest population of the eastern subspecies but were devastated this fall by Hurricane Helene. Thousands were displaced or found dead amid rubble. Others were found in flooded church basements and returned to the river. But some rivers are so polluted, there\u2019s still a \u201cdo not touch\u201d advisory for people.",
      "Tierra Curry burst into tears when she learned of the proposed protection.",
      "\u201cI just think it's a moral failure that we're pushing them to the brink of extinction,\u201d said Curry, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity.",
      "The slimy, brown creature with a broad, flat head may never win a beauty contest, but it is famous as the largest amphibian in North America.",
      "The hellbender breathes dissolved oxygen in the water through its skin. Water that becomes slow-moving, warm or polluted holds less oxygen.",
      "Over the past five years, two dams were removed on the Watauga River to help improve water quality and reconnect hellbender communities. The most recent one came down this summer \u2014 and two months later, Helene upended life not just for people, but also for animals like the salamander.",
      "For those working to ensure the species' survival, the newly proposed federal protection couldn't come soon enough, said Erin McCombs, Southeast conservation director for American Rivers.",
      "\u201cWe have to be paying more attention to the health of our nation's rivers and streams, and that means paying more attention to the critters that live in them,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen species like the hellbender, which are reliant on free-flowing and clean water, are declining, alarms need to be going off, because we'll feel the impacts next.\u201d",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity petitioned and won protection for the Ozark subspecies of hellbenders in 2011 and for Missouri hellbenders, another population of eastern hellbender, in 2021. The group sued, seeking protection for all eastern hellbenders. As of this week, all hellbenders in the U.S. are protected or slated for protection under the Endangered Species Act.",
      "Hill says he hopes the new federal protection will usher in \u201cbold strategies\u201d to help the species recover.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a massive effort,\" he said.",

      "Associated Press writer Lou Kesten has chosen his top 10 video games of 2024",
      "WASHINGTON -- It\u2019s been a rough year in the world of video games, which reeled from some high-profile flops (sorry, Suicide Squad and Star Wars fans) and a relentless series of developer layoffs. Fortunately, indie designers stepped up to fill in the gaps. And toward the end of the year, a few AAA studios rallied with ambitious, big-budget adventures.",
      "The top 10 games of 2024 recall a brighter age when it seemed like anything was possible in our virtual worlds. Here\u2019s hoping the industry learns from their success.",
      "In a politically exhausting year, Japan\u2019s Studio Zero pulled off the seemingly impossible: rendering the process of reforming a corrupt world with something resembling \u2026 hope? The corruption that has beset the quasi-medieval Euchronia is quite literal, embodied by hideous mutants known (rather unsubtly) as \u201chumans.\u201d The fight to restore sanity blends stirring battles with unusually thoughtful reflections on justice, all with the eye-popping visuals you\u2019d expect from the creators of the Persona series.",
      "The last few years have brought a surge in so-called \u201cmetroidvanias\u201d \u2014 enormous two-dimensional mazes that blend arcade action with tricky puzzles. Solo designer Billy Basso\u2019s Animal Well is the apex, presenting a vast underground network whose inhabitants range from mice to flamingos. Every challenge you solve opens a smorgasbord of new challenges, and it\u2019s easy to get lost for hours in its eerie, hallucinatory world.",
      "In this drama from Sweden\u2019s Simigo, a young woman is invited to explore a hotel that\u2019s been seemingly abandoned by its owner, an avant-garde filmmaker. Every room has a puzzle, and the more you solve the deeper you fall under its spell. It\u2019s like being trapped in a David Lynch movie, where you\u2019re always questioning the boundaries between dreams and reality.",
      "BioWare, the studio behind landmark role-playing games like Mass Effect and the original Baldur\u2019s Gate, finally returns to its strengths with this fantasy epic. It has all the hallmarks of the genre, with a motley crew of fighters, mages and rogues joining forces against a world-threatening evil. The combat is engaging, the stories are unpredictable and the characters are endearingly loopy.",
      "The most endearing character of the year has to be the adorable protagonist of this adventure from Sony\u2019s Team Asobi. The spunky little robot is on a planet-hopping mission to rescue dozens of his fellow droids, with each stop presenting a fresh assortment of running, jumping and punching challenges. It\u2019s the sort of game we used to see more of on the PlayStation, and it\u2019s thoroughly delightful.",
      "Luisa is a burnt-out corporate drone who needs a break. So why not head to the Alps and cut loose by fighting some monsters? Compared to Metaphor and Dragon Age, the dungeons devised by Austria\u2019s Microbird Games are more tightly focused, given that you can only take a few magic spells on each expedition. But the puzzles are clever, and this oddball tourist town has other intriguing mysteries worth investigating.",
      "More dungeons, as Nintendo returns to Hyrule. At long last you get to play as Princess Zelda, who wields a scepter that allows her to duplicate the tools she needs to surmount obstacles \u2014 or summon creatures to fight her foes. Echoes combines the top-down action of 1987\u2019s original-recipe Zelda with the improvisation of last year\u2019s \u201cTears of the Kingdom,\u201d and should satisfy fans of both.",
      "Bethesda Softworks delivers a rarity, a AAA action-adventure in which the protagonist spends more time quietly figuring out the enigmas of the Egyptian pyramids and Vatican City than mindlessly shooting enemies. Veteran voice actor Troy Baker does a fine job standing in for Harrison Ford, the dialog sparkles and the graphics are stunningly detailed. It\u2019s one of 2024\u2019s biggest surprises \u2014 and don\u2019t worry, you do get to punch Nazis.",
      "This indie smash from solo developer LocalThunk looks simple: a solitaire version of poker in which you score points by racking up good hands. Throw in some jokers, though \u2014 say, a \u201cGreedy Joker\u201d that makes diamonds more valuable \u2014 and it gets complicated. The higher your score, the more jokers become available. It\u2019s a classic \u201cjust one more hand\u201d hook; don\u2019t download Balatro if you expect to get anything else done today.",
      "A team of indie developers led by Spelunky designer Derek Yu conjured up this tribute to the games of the 1980s. It\u2019s insanely ambitious, with 50 complete games ranging across every imaginable genre, from shoot-'em-ups to strategy to racing to role-playing. There\u2019s even a Pong variant. It\u2019s a feast for anyone who remembers the dawn of video games \u2014 or is too young to have been there."

      "The U.S. has updated a decades-old science and technology agreement with China to reflect their growing rivalry for technological dominance",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has updated a decades-old science and technology agreement with China to reflect their growing rivalry for technological dominance. The new agreement, signed Friday in Beijing after many months of negotiations, has a narrower scope and additional safeguards to minimize the risk to national security.",
      "The State Department said the agreement sustains intellectual property protections, establishes new guardrails to protect the safety and security of researchers and \"advances U.S. interests through newly established and strengthened provisions on transparency and data reciprocity.\u201d",
      "It covers only basic research and does not facilitate the development of critical and emerging technologies, the department said. This includes technologies related to artificial intelligence and quantum computing, which are considered crucial for economic strength and military supremacy.",
      "China's science and technology ministry also announced the signing, but provided no details or assessment in its one-line statement. The Chinese foreign ministry said earlier this year that such cooperation is mutually beneficial.",
      "The first such agreement was signed in January 1979 when the two countries established diplomatic ties to counter the influence of the Soviet Union and when China severely lagged behind the U.S. and other Western nations in science and technology.",
      "The agreement was last extended in 2018, and given temporary extensions last year and this year to allow for negotiations. Washington had come to view the agreement as failing to reflect the shift in U.S.-China relations and China\u2019s emergence as a heavyweight in the field. The new agreement extends cooperation for five years.",
      "As the tech war between the two countries has escalated, the U.S. has banned exports of advanced chips to China and restricted U.S. investments in certain technologies that could boost China's military capabilities. Cooperation in science and technology chilled in universities and research institutions after a Trump-era program was introduced to curb China's spying. The program was ended in 2022 after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and because of concerns that it had prompted racial profiling.",
      "Deborah Seligsohn, an assistant professor of political science at Villanova University, said the new agreement would lead to fewer government-to-government programs, but, through its limited scope and stronger safeguards, it would allow for the cooperation to be sustained \u201cthrough a more difficult relationship.\u201d",
      "Earlier this year, Rep. Andy Barr, a Kentucky Republican, said the decades-long cooperation had resulted in the U.S. \u201cproviding all sorts of scientific and technical knowledge to Chinese scientists in what would amount to the greatest outpouring of American scientific and technology expertise in history.\u201d",
      "Rep. Gregory Meeks, a Democrat from New York, argued that the U.S. and the global community also have benefited from research collaborations that have \u201cprevented diseases, reduced pollution, and deepened our understanding of the Earth's history.\u201d",
      "But Meeks said he favored congressional oversight to ensure projects under the agreement would be in line with U.S. values and interests."

      "Police had briefly mentioned a higher death toll but later revised the information.",
      "The suspect, a student at the school, is also dead, police said.",
      "The teen suspect was female, multiple law enforcement sources told ABC News.",
      "A motive is not clear, Madison Police Chief Shon Barnes said at a news conference.",
      "The teenage suspect used a handgun, police said. Authorities are investigating the origin of the firearm, Barnes said.",
      "Two students are in critical condition with life-threatening injuries, Barnes said. Three other students and a teacher suffered non-life-threatening injuries, he said Monday evening. He had previously said six students were injured before including a teacher among the victims.",
      "Officers responded to the active shooter report around 10:57 a.m. The suspect was dead upon police arrival and no officers fired their weapons, Barnes said.",
      "The shooting was \"confined to one space,\" but it's not clear if it was a classroom or hallway, the chief said.",
      "Police believe that the suspect was already in the school and that there wasn't any breach.",
      "\"I never saw so many police cars in my life -- just blue and red lights lining the school, lining the streets. Fire department, paramedics, everybody was there,\" swarming the usually quiet neighborhood, John Diaz De Leon told ABC News Live.",
      "He said he saw officers with long guns at the scene and older students run from the school across the parking lot.",
      "\"Later on, very slowly in a more orderly fashion, the younger students holding hands were let out to go across the parking lot,\" he said.",
      "'I never saw so many police cars': Eyewitness to Madison school shooting",

      "Detectives are investigating whether there were any potential warning signs, Barnes said.",
      "All students had been reunited with their parents by Monday evening, Barnes said. About 390 students from kindergarten through 12th grade attend the private school.",
      "Barbara Wiers, the director of elementary and school relations for Abundant Life Christian School, thanked first responders for their support and said the school community is leaning on their faith at this time.",
      "\"This has obviously rocked our school community, but we know it affects not just our school community, but Madison and the greater area and all schools,\" Wiers said at a press briefing on Monday. \"Our hope is that there will be some good that comes out of this as we can learn and grow and continue to support other schools.\"",
      "The school does not have metal detectors or a school resource officer, but has other security protocols in place, she said.",
      "President Joe Biden called the incident \"shocking and unconscionable\" in a statement Monday evening that called on Congress to act, \"now.\"",
      "He insisted that they pass \"commonsense\" gun safety laws including universal background checks, a national red flag law and a ban on both assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.",
      "\"It is unacceptable that we are unable to protect our children from this scourge of gun violence,\" the statement said, adding, \"We cannot continue to accept it as normal.\"",
      "Biden also mentioned his administration's efforts to combat the gun violence epidemic in the United States, including the implementation of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, while stating that more needed to be done and offering his prayers to those affected in Madison.",
      "The Madison police chief said he began his career as a teacher.",
      "\"We owe it to our community to do everything possible to ensure [schools are] not only a special place, but a safe place,\" he said.",
      "\"I hoped that this day would never come in Madison,\" Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said.",
      "She stressed the need for gun violence prevention and said she wants the community and country to make sure \"no public official ever has to stand in this position again.\"",
      "Jill Underly, Wisconsin's superintendent of public instruction, also emphasized the need for change, saying in a statement, \"This tragedy is a stark reminder that we must do more to protect our children and our educators to ensure that such horrors never happen again. We will not rest until we find solutions that make our schools safe.\"",
      "Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said in a statement, \"There are no words to describe the devastation and heartbreak we feel,\" calling the shooting a \"gut-wrenching tragedy.\"",
      "Evers said he and his wife are \"praying for the families and loved ones of those whose lives were so senselessly taken and for the educators, staff, and the entire Abundant Life school community.\"",
      "\"It is unthinkable that a kid or an educator might wake up and go to school one morning and never come home,\" he said. \"This should never happen, and I will never accept this as a foregone reality or stop working to change it.\"",

      "He has in the past promoted the debunked theory linking vaccines to autism, and a lawyer helping Kennedy hire staffers for the incoming administration has pushed for the revocation of the federal approval for the polio vaccine.

But on Monday, he said he anticipated that would be \u201cmore difficult\u201d to resolve than the current turmoil in the Middle East, which is rooted in the century-old Israeli Palestinian conflict.",
      "\u201cI see that as more difficult,\u201d Trump said, before decrying the Biden administration\u2019s recent decision to loosen restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of American-supplied arms in recent weeks, allowing Kyiv to strike deeper inside Russian territory.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that should have been allowed,\u201d he said. \u201cCertainly not just weeks before I take over.",

      "\"She's a patriot,\" Schmitt said of Trump's pick for intelligence director.",
      "Sen. Eric Schmitt, R-Mo., said Sunday that he has no concerns about President-elect Donald Trump's selection of former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to serve as director of national intelligence.",
      "Gabbard, a vocal non-interventionist, has seen her credentials come under scrutiny, particularly in light of a regime change in Syria and her covert meeting with former strongman Bashar Assad in 2017, which occurred after he had used chemical weapons on protesters. She later said Assad was \"not the enemy of the United States.\"",
      "\"I know Tulsi Gabbard. She's a patriot. She served our country honorably. She, I think, fits the reform agenda. President Trump ran on disrupting permanent Washington and having people who are going to view things differently,\" Schmitt told \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos. \"There's a lot of reform, George, that needs to happen in those agencies. Tulsi Gabbard is somebody who I think can execute on that.\"",
      "\"I don't think it's unusual for members of Congress to visit foreign countries and talk to foreign leaders,\" he said of the former Democratic congresswoman. \"President Trump, I think, believes in engaging in diplomacy, solving these things.\"",
      "Gabbard has begun meeting with senators on Capitol Hill to try to get the votes she'll need from them for confirmation, though her chances have coincided with a wider debate over the U.S. role in Syria.",
      "Trump has said the U.S. should stay out of events there, although there are 900 U.S. troops in the country to fight remaining ISIS pockets. Trump has not definitively said what he plans to do with those troops.",
      "\"I think that's a longer discussion, and a discussion that President Trump had in his first term,\" Schmitt said. \"I do think we're entering a new phase, though, of realism in this country. President Trump would be less interventionist, and we get back to our core national interests, principally defending the homeland, the Indo-Pacific and China.\"",
      "\"Understanding what terrorism means around the world is important, but having these trip wires in other regions that pull us into wars, I think the American people have had enough of that,\" he added when pressed on the risks of an ISIS resurgence if U.S. troops leave Syria.",
      "Gabbard is just one of many Trump picks who will need to win confirmation.",
      "Stephanopoulos also pressed Schmitt on Kash Patel, the president-elect's choice to lead the FBI.",
      "Patel is a top Trump loyalist who has railed against the \"deep state\" and pushed to eliminate the FBI's intelligence gathering capabilities, leading some critics to say that he'd politicize the bureau in Trump's favor.",
      "Asked about Patel's book \"Government Gangsters,\" in which he included a 60-person \"enemies list,\" Schmitt dismissed that as a \"footnote\" in the book and insisted that Patel does not have an \"enemies list.\" Schmitt said Patel would bring change to an agency that many Republicans have grown to distrust.",
      "\"That agency is in desperate need of reform. Kash Patel is very qualified, and I think he's going to get the support in the Senate,\" Schmitt said.",
      "On Trump's promise to pardon Jan. 6 rioters, Schmitt said the president-elect would look at pardons on an individual basis and decipher between violent and non-violent offenders, which he said is the \"exact right approach.\"",
      "\"I think you do separate violent acts from non-violent acts, but I think he's been pretty clear he's going to view these individually,\" Schmitt said.",

    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s personal attorney previously lobbied the Food and Drug Administration to revoke approval of the polio vaccine.",
    "story": [
      "Aaron Siri has been interviewing candidates for top jobs at HHS.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s personal attorney previously lobbied the Food and Drug Administration to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine, highlighting an influential Kennedy ally who, sources tell ABC News, has been helping interview candidates for top health jobs in the incoming Trump administration.",
      "The matter could be something RFK Jr. gets questioned about when he goes to Capitol Hill next week to meet with senators considering whether to confirm him as health and human services secretary..",
      "Aaron Siri, a partner at the law firm Siri & Glimstad, has long fought against the prevalence of vaccines. He has also filed petitions seeking to pause the distribution of other vaccines, including Hepatitis B, and to revoke the emergency-use authorization of COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "The 2022 polio petition was made on behalf of one of Siri's clients, the Informed Consent Action Network (ICAN), a group founded by Del Bigtree, another close Kennedy ally also involved in health-related transition matters, according to sources.",
      "\"Petitioner requests that the FDA withdraw or suspend the approval for [the polio vaccine] for infants, toddlers, and children until a properly controlled and properly powered double-blind trial of sufficient duration is conducted to assess the safety of this product,\" Siri wrote.",
      "The New York Times reported on the petition earlier Friday.",
      "When asked for comment, Siri referenced posts he made on the social site X, where he reiterated his belief that the FDA ignored safety concerns with the vaccine. It\u2019s an allegation strongly refuted by medical experts who say the benefits far outweigh the risk of contracting a disease that can cause paralysis.",
      "Kennedy, meanwhile, did not respond to written questions about whether he agrees with revoking approval of the polio vaccine, or if, as health and human services secretary, he would intervene in an FDA review of Siri's petitions.",
      "The polio vaccine available in the United States is recommended for children and three doses offer at least 99% protection against severe disease, including paralysis, according to the CDC. Side effects are usually mild and go away on their own, the agency notes, and the vaccine has not been known to cause serious problems.",
      "Since the late 1980s, global polio cases have decreased by more than 99% alongside increased vaccination efforts to eradicate the disease, from an estimated 350,000 cases to just six reported in 2021, according to the World Health Organization. The efforts have allowed an estimated 20 million people to walk today who would have otherwise been paralyzed and saved more than 1.5 million lives, according to the CDC.",
      "The polio vaccine has been a part of routine childhood schedule for decades, and federal health officials utilize multiple systems to monitor for vaccine safety. Polio can cause lifelong paralysis and up to 10% of children who have paralysis from polio die, as the virus affects the muscles that allow them to breathe, the CDC notes.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor, said in a statement provided to reporters that any efforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures is not only uninformed, but also dangerous.",
      "\"Like millions of families before them, my parents knew the pain and fear of watching their child struggle with the life-altering diagnosis of polio,\" he said. \"From the age of two, normal life without paralysis was only possible for me because of the miraculous combination of modern medicine and a mother's love. But for millions who came after me, the real miracle was the saving power of the polio vaccine.",
      "McConnell added that efforts to undermine confidence in the vaccine are dangerous and suggested Kennedy should make it clear he doesn\u2019t agree with Siri's views if he wants to be confirmed as health secretary.",
      "\"Anyone seeking the Senate's consent to serve in the incoming Administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts,\" McConnell said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on RFK Jr. to \"state his position\" on the matter.",
      "\"This would undoubtedly make America sick again. It's outrageous and dangerous for people in the Trump Transition to try and get rid of the polio vaccine that has virtually eradicated polio in America and saved millions of lives. RFK Jr. must state his position on this,\" Schumer said in an online post.",

    "summary": "Hilton is headed back to Washington D.C. to meet with House members on Monday, urging leadership to call the bill to the floor for a vote.",
    "story": [
      "The bill passed the Senate last week and awaits a House vote.",
      "Paris Hilton said she was shopping in Saks Fifth Avenue in New York last week when she heard The Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act -- a piece of legislation she\u2019s tirelessly lobbied for over the past three years -- had passed the U.S. Senate with unanimous support.",
      "The celebrity hotel heiress told ABC News that she was with her sister, \u201cdoing a little girls, sister holiday shopping,\u201d when she got a FaceTime call with the update that the bill, which would place greater federal safeguards on institutional youth treatment programs, had hit its first major legislative milestone.",
      "Hilton for years has been an outspoken, public advocate for reform in congregate care facilities and residential treatment programs for \"troubled\" minors. She\u2019s brazenly described her own traumatizing experience at Provo Canyon School in Utah when she was a teenager.",
      "\u201cWe were all just bawling, in tears, just so proud and so happy, and the whole survivor community is just -- everybody is just so so grateful and so happy, and they feel so validated that they're being listened to,\u201d the entrepreneur, DJ, model and actress told ABC News about her reaction to the bill\u2019s Senate passage on Wednesday.",
      "Now, with only a week left in the 118th Congress, Hilton is urging House leaders to prioritize the measure and bring it to the floor for a vote \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're all just hoping and praying that they'll do the right thing,\u201d said Hilton, who is headed back to Washington D.C. to meet with House members on Monday.",
      "\u201cI just really hope that they, you know, don't let politics stand in the way of saving children's lives. This is so urgent, because the House of Representatives has to pass this bill in the next week before the end of this year's session, or else the bill will die. We would have to do it all over again.\u201d",
      "ABC News did not receive a response from Speaker Mike Johnson on whether he'd consider bringing the legislation to the floor for a vote during the final week of the session. The legislation-- which would ordinarily need to pass through the House Energy and Commerce committee before it could get called by leaders to the floor-- is able to be fast-tracked by bypassing that step, according to a source familiar with committee business.",
      "\"When the U.S. Senate came together in a rare show of unity to pass the Stop Institutional Child Abuse Act unanimously on Wednesday December 11th, it was one of the best moments of my life. It was proof that when we listen to survivors and put politics aside, we can create real, meaningful change. But this journey isn\u2019t over. I can\u2019t celebrate until this bill becomes law, and now it\u2019s up to the U.S House of Representatives to finish what the Senate started,\" Hilton wrote in an open letter shared to her Instagram page on Monday.",
      "\"To Leader Scalise, Speaker Johnson, and every member of the House: I urge you to think about the children who can\u2019t speak for themselves. They\u2019re relying on us\u2014on you\u2014to stand up for their safety and dignity. Passing this bill would be a testament to what we can achieve when we lead with empathy and courage.\"",
      "Hilton has traveled to Washington every six to 10 months starting in October 2021, according to her spokesperson, each time asking Congress to reform youth residential treatment facilities.",
      "She\u2019s met individually with members like Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who thanked Hilton after the bill\u2019s passage last week for her work on the issue, and Republicans like Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Tim Scott of South Carolina.",
      "Some of her biggest advocates have been the cosponsors of the bill: Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, along with Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., Hilton said.",
      "\"A lack of oversight and transparency in residential youth programs has allowed for the abuse of children in facilities across the country for far too long,\" Cornyn said in a statement after the bill passed.",
      "\"I'm proud that the Senate unanimously passed this legislation to ensure the vulnerable children in these facilities are protected, and I want to thank the countless advocates who have bravely shared their stories to help end institutional child abuse.\"",
      "Hilton also testified before the House Ways and Means Committee in June, emotionally recounting her experience being at Provo Canyon School as a teen.",
      "\u201cThese programs promised healing, growth, and support, but instead did not allow me to speak, move freely, or even look out a window for two years,\u201d she testified in 2023. \u201cI was force-fed medications and sexually abused by the staff. I was violently restrained and dragged down hallways, stripped naked, and thrown into solitary confinement.\u201d",
      "The Provo school in Utah, which is still operating today, released an updated statement in June 2024 saying they couldn't comment on the operations or student experiences at the school prior to August 2000, when it had changed ownership shortly after Hilton's stint there. Provo said it did not \u201ccondone or promote any form of abuse,\" in their statement.",
      "Hilton has gone to the White House to advocate for child welfare, meeting with policy staff in May 2022. Should the bill pass through the House this week, it would land on President Joe Biden\u2019s desk to be signed into law before the end of his term. Hilton and her team expressed confidence in the president\u2019s willingness to sign the measure.",
      "\u201cWe have had some prior conversations with the White House about the bill, and we don't have a reason to believe that they wouldn't sign it into law,\u201d Hilton\u2019s spokesperson said.",
      "The socialite\u2019s push for congregate-care reform started in 2021, when she came to Washington in support of a similar measure, the Federal Accountability for Congregate Care Act, which was a different bill that was introduced in October 2021 and led by Khanna, Merkley, Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., and then-Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.",
      "Before her visit in 2021, Hilton had opened up about her 11-month experience at Provo Canyon school in her 2020 documentary \"This is Paris,\" and in a Washington Post op-ed.",
      "Hilton told ABC News that the lobbying process for her has been painful but also cathartic.",
      "\u201cIt's been a lot of work\u2026it's not easy to speak about so many things are so painful and traumatic, but I know that it's so important just to be able to be a voice for those who don't, and I'm so grateful to be able to use my platform and my voice just to ensure that no more children are traumatized in the name of treatment,\u201d Hilton said.",
      "\u201cAnd it's been also just a very healing experience to see what an impact it's made\u2026it's been just incredibly healing and cathartic.\u201d",
      "Hilton is in New York with her friend and \"The Simple Life\" co-star Nicole Richie to promote a reboot of their iconic show, but said her work on issues related to the troubled teen industry was her most significant venture.",
      "\u201cI am so proud of a lot of things in my life, but the work -- my advocacy work that I'm doing to protect children -- is the thing that I'm most proud of, and this is what I want my legacy to be,\u201d Hilton said.",
      "If the bill doesn\u2019t pass this session, Hilton said she would continue to fight for the issue.",
      "\u201cI won't stop fighting until change is made. This is my lifelong mission and I really believe it's my true purpose in life. I will not stop fighting for these children and being a voice for them.\u201d",

      "He's expected to be questioned about his plans for vaccines and food.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. arrives on Capitol Hill on Monday to kickstart several days of private meetings with more than two dozen senators and their staff in a bid to become the nation's next health secretary.",
      "Among the senators on Kennedy's list is Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the GOP's pick to become the next Senate majority leader, and incoming Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, a doctor.",
      "Kennedy's chances of getting confirmed by the Senate aren't clear. His past comments questioning vaccine science and the food industry could lose -- and gain -- votes on either side of the aisle depending on how he talks about his plans for the incoming administration.",
      "Here are three questions surrounding his nomination:",
      "Kennedy has said he's not opposed to all vaccines. He says he fully vaccinated, with the exception of the COVID-19 shot, and that he has vaccinated his children.",
      "Kennedy also has falsely claimed that childhood vaccines cause autism, even though the study claiming that link has been retracted and numerous other high-quality studies have found no evidence that vaccines are tied to autism.",
      "In addition, Kennedy has questioned the safety of the polio vaccine and enlisted the help of a longtime adviser and anti-vaccine advocate, Aaron Siri, to vet potential job candidates for the incoming administration.",
      "Siri petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 to revoke its approval of the polio vaccine on behalf of an anti-vaccination advocacy group.",
      "Katie Miller, a transition spokesperson, said Kennedy and Siri have never spoken about Siri's petitions.",
      "\"Mr. Kennedy believes the polio vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied,\" she said.",
      "Dr. Richard Besser, a former head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and an ABC News contributor, said senators should ask Kennedy if he would consider using his new post to discourage local school districts from requiring vaccinations.",
      "While state -- not federal -- laws establish vaccination requirements for local schools, they rely heavily on the recommendations by the CDC and FDA, which Kennedy would oversee as health secretary, if confirmed. Currently, all 50 states and Washington, D.C., have laws requiring vaccines to attend schools, although many offer exemptions.",
      "\"What will you do to make sure that parents can feel comfortable sending their children to school protected from measles, whooping cough and other vaccine-preventable diseases if vaccines are no longer required?\" Besser said senators should be asking Kennedy.",
      "On questioning the polio vaccine, Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, the longest-serving Senate leader in history and a polio survivor, said last week that anyone seeking Senate confirmation would \"do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\"",
      "Confirmation bias is the idea that people often seek out information that supports their own deeply held beliefs, rather than be open to accepting new information that might challenge their ideas.",
      "When it comes to the polio vaccination, Kennedy has said he's willing to say that he's wrong but that he has yet to see information that would convince him.",
      "\"If you show me a scientific study that shows that I'm wrong ... I'm going to put that on my Twitter and I'm going to say I was wrong,\" he said in a podcast last year with Lex Fridman.",
      "It's likely several senators will ask Kennedy whether he'd be willing to change his mind on vaccines based on data, or if he's already convinced that the data is wrong or manipulated.",
      "Critics say Kennedy is willfully ignoring the information that's out there already. In a letter obtained by The New York Times, more than 75 Nobel Prize winners urged senators to block his nomination, citing his \"lack of credentials or relative experience\" in matters of medicine, science and public health.",
      "\"In view of his record, placing Mr. Kennedy in charge of [the Department of Health and Human Services] would put the public's health in jeopardy and undermine America's global leadership in the health sciences, in both the public and commercial sectors,\" the laureates wrote.",
      "Kennedy finds the most political consensus when he talks about America's obesity crisis and blames the high levels of sugar, sodium and fat in ultra-processed foods. A longtime environmental advocate, he's also taken aim at the use of additives pushed by food companies -- earning him kudos from some Democrats.",
      "\"We're prioritizing corporations feeding us unhealthy products instead of family farmers growing fresh, healthy foods - and we let too many dangerous chemicals flood our food system,\" said Sen. Cory Booker last month after Kennedy's nomination was announced.",
      "\"We all must come together to build a system that works for all,\" he added.",
      "But one big question many senators will likely ask is how Kennedy plans to turn around America's eating habits in a way that doesn't hurt U.S. farmers or heavily regulate agricultural businesses that are key political supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. During Trump's first administration, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue rolled back Obama-era rules that sought to limit sodium and sugar in children's school lunches that accept federal subsidies.",
      "FDA Administrator Robert Califf, who will step down when Trump takes office in January, testified recently before a Senate committee that there's a lot we still don't know about food science and safety. When the FDA does move ahead with regulation, he said the rule is often challenged in court.",

    "summary": "Rep. Nancy Mace has made headlines for her rhetoric around the transgender community, including her efforts to ban transgender women from using women's restrooms.",
    "story": [
      "Mace used to call herself \"pro-transgender\" and \"pro-LGBTQ.\"",
      "Rep. Nancy Mace has recently made headlines and faced protests for her rhetoric around the transgender community, particularly for her efforts to ban transgender women from using women's restrooms at the U.S. Capitol just as the first transgender representative has been elected to Congress.",
      "This month, Mace, R-S.C., used a slur against the transgender community in a video on social media. She used the term in reference to protesters who demonstrated in the halls of Congress against the trans bathroom ban.",
      "Now Mace is back in the headlines for accusing foster youth advocate James McIntyre of assault. According to court documents obtained by ABC News, McIntyre allegedly approached Mace to shake her hand after she spoke at an event to celebrate the 25th anniversary of legislation benefiting foster youth.",
      "Mace claimed to officials that \u201cthe subject began to aggressively and in an exaggerated manner shake her arm up and down in a hand shaking motion. The effect of the motion was described as her arm flailing for about 3-5 seconds.\u201d",
      "McIntryre is said to have stated \u201ctrans youth deserve advocacy\u201d during the interaction. Mace told police she had pain in her wrists, arm and armpits due to the incident, but refused assistance from paramedics. McIntyre was arrested and has pleaded not guilty to charges of assaulting a government official.",
      "In a post on X following the incident, Mace called McIntyre \"a pro-tr*ns man.\"",
      "Mace's recent remarks appear to be a shift from her comments in years past, when she had referred to herself as \u201cpro-transgender\u201d and \u201cpro-LGBTQ.\u201d",
      "ABC News has reached out to Mace's office for comment.",
      "Prior to the legislation to ban transgender women from Capitol bathrooms, Mace supported the \"Fairness for All Act,\" expressed support for socially transitioning youth and faced backlash for what critics called her pro-transgender support.",
      "2021: Mace says she supports \u2018LGBTQ rights and equality\u2019",
      "In an interview with the Washington Examiner in 2021, Mace told a reporter: \"I strongly support LGBTQ rights and equality ... no one should be discriminated against.\"",
      "In the interview, she discussed her opposition to the Equality Act, which would expand federal civil rights laws to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. She instead supported the \u201cFairness for All Act,\u201d which was aimed at banning discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity but allowing certain exceptions for religious organizations.",
      "According to the outlet, Mace agreed that, for example, secular companies shouldn\u2019t be able to discriminate based on sexual orientation or gender identity \u2013 but that religious organizations do not have to \u201cviolate their moral or religious conscience,\u201d the outlet wrote.",
      "\"It isn\u2019t a black-and-white issue,\" Mace said in the interview. \"I do believe that religious liberty, the First Amendment, gay rights, and transgender equality can all coexist. I\u2019m also a constitutionalist, and we have to ensure anti-discrimination laws don\u2019t violate First Amendment rights or religious freedom.\"",
      "She told the outlet she has \u201cfriends and family that identify as LGBTQ \u2026 Understanding how they feel and how they\u2019ve been treated is important. Having been around gay, lesbian, and transgender people has informed my opinion over my lifetime.\"",
      "At the time, she said younger conservatives were becoming more supportive of LGBTQ rights: \u201cPeople don\u2019t want the government in their bedrooms or their board rooms.\"",
      "2022: Mace faces attack ads for her views",
      "In the 2022 primary race, Mace was the subject of political attack ads from the conservative American Principles PAC targeting her for her pro-transgender support.",
      "The ad claimed Mace supported \u201cmen in girls\u2019 locker rooms, men in women\u2019s prisons, and even men in battered women\u2019s shelters,\" referring to transgender women as men.",
      "2023: Mace appears to support social transitioning for minors",
      "In a 2023 interview with CBS News, Mace said: \u201cI'm pro-transgender rights. I'm pro-LGBTQ. Just don't go to the extreme with our kids.\"",
      "She spoke about her support for bans on gender-affirming care for transgender youth, stating that\u00a0\"sex change surgery, the hormone blockers that sterilize our children. We shouldn't be doing that.\" Medical experts have said puberty blockers are reversible and do not permanently sterilize patients.",
      "However, Mace appeared to express support for youth who are socially transitioning: \u201cIf they wanna take on a different pronoun or a different gender identity or grow their hair out, or wear a dress or wear pants, or do those things as a minor\u2014those are all things that I think most people would support. Be who you want to be, but don\u2019t make permanent changes as a child,\u201d Mace said.",
      "2024: Mace introduces bathroom ban amid rise in anti-LGBTQ sentiment",
      "In November, Mace introduced a measure to ban transgender women from using women\u2019s restrooms at the U.S. Capitol, targeting Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, the first transgender person elected to Congress.",
      "\"Yes, and absolutely. And then some,\" Mace told reporters at the Capitol when asked about whether the legislation was in response to McBride's election.",
      "\"I'm not going to stand for a man, you know, someone with a penis, in the women's locker room,\" she said.",
      "Mace invoked her own experiences as a victim of rape as part of the reason she introduced the measure.",
      "\"That's not OK. And I'm a victim of abuse myself. I'm a rape survivor,\" Mace said. \"I have PTSD from the abuse I've suffered at the hands of a man, and I know how vulnerable women and girls are in private spaces, so I'm absolutely 100% going to stand in the way of any man who wants to be in a women's restroom, in our locker rooms, in our changing rooms. I will be there fighting you every step of the way,\" she said.",
      "McBride responded to the bill on X: \"This is a blatant attempt from far right-wing extremists to distract from the fact they have no real solutions to what Americans are facing.\"",
      "After House Speaker Mike Johnson said transgender women cannot use women's restrooms in the Capitol and House office buildings, McBride responded to imposed rules: \"I\u2019m not here to fight about bathrooms. I\u2019m here to fight for Delawareans and to bring down costs facing families. Like all members, I will follow the rules as outlined by Speaker Johnson, even if I disagree with them.\"",
      "Each representative's office has a private restroom and unisex restrooms are also available throughout the Capitol.",
      "Opponents of the ban say that the narrative around \"fear\" and \"personal safety\" concerning transgender use of bathrooms is rooted in discrimination. They argue transgender people aren't inherently dangerous and are actually more likely to be victims of violence than cisgender people.",
      "Mace said she wanted to expand her efforts and push a measure that would ban transgender women from using women's bathrooms on all federal property: \"This shouldn't be going on any federal property. If you're a school or an institution that gets government funding, this kind of thing should be banned,\" she said.",
      "Transgender people -- who make up less than 1% of Americans over the age of 13, according to UCLA's research organization, the Williams Institute -- have been the subjects of hundreds of Republican-backed bills across the country in recent years.",
      "When protesters entered the Capitol to protest efforts to restrict transgender bathroom use in early December, Mace responded with a video on X, where she called protesters a derogatory slur for transgender people.",

      "\u201cWe are worried about the overgrowth of tourism. Tourism has grown so rapidly, it\u2019s not anymore in control,\u201d said 43-year-old Antti Pakkanen, a photographer and member of a housing network that in September organized a rally through the city\u2019s streets.",

      "Trump called the decision made by Biden last month \u201cstupid.\" He also expressed anger that his incoming administration was not consulted before Biden made the move.

    "summary": "An attorney defending Jay-Z against a rape allegation says the unnamed accuser's account is &ldquo;provably, demonstrably false.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "An attorney defending Jay-Z against a rape allegation says the unnamed accuser's account is \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "NEW YORK -- An attorney defending Jay-Z against the rape allegation brought against him last week by an unnamed woman outlined a range of evidence Monday that he said showed the accuser\u2019s account to be \u201cprovably, demonstrably false.\u201d",
      "The woman told NBC News last week that Jay-Z and Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs sexually assaulted her in 2000, when she was 13, at an after-party for the MTV Music Awards. She has since acknowledged certain inconsistencies in her story.",
      "Speaking to reporters at Roc Nation\u2019s New York headquarters, Jay-Z\u2019s attorney, Alex Spiro, said the woman\u2019s claim relied on an \u201cimpossible timeline\u201d and a nonexistent location. While the lawsuit said the assault happened at a \u201clarge white residence with a U-shaped driveway,\u201d photos show both Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter, and Combs at a nightclub following the award show.",
      "In the suit, the woman said she snuck out of a window of her home in Rochester and hitched a ride to the award ceremony from a friend, who has since died. She said she watched the event on a jumbotron outside, then befriended a limousine driver who drove her to the house party where she was assaulted by the two rap moguls.",
      "Following the alleged rape, she said she fled the house and called her father for a ride home from a nearby gas station.",
      "The allegation, Spiro said, \u201cdefies credibility.\u201d It would\u2019ve taken her five hours to drive from Rochester, the lawyer noted, meaning she would\u2019ve had to leave her home by 3 p.m. Permits and photographs show there was no jumbotron outside the VMAs in 2000, according to Spiro. The woman\u2019s father has said he does not recall driving from Rochester to pick her up in New York City.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just that this story is a lie and that it\u2019s not true, it\u2019s provably, demonstrably false,\u201d Spiro said. \"This never happened.\u201d",
      "The suit comes amid a wave of sexual assault lawsuits levied against Combs, who remains in custody in New York awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in May.",
      "The lawsuits were filed on the eve of the expiration of the Adult Survivors Act, a New York law permitting victims of sexual abuse a one-year window to file civil action regardless of the statute of limitations.",
      "After initially suing Combs, the woman\u2019s complaint was amended to include a new allegation that Jay-Z also participated in the sexual assault as a third unnamed celebrity watched.",
      "The litigation was filed by Tony Buzbee, a personal injury attorney in Houston whose firm has set up a toll-free phone line for accusers. In October, Buzbee said he was representing some 120 people, men and women, with allegations of sexual misconduct against Combs.",
      "Last month, Jay-Z anonymously sued Buzbee, alleging the lawyer had attempted to blackmail him by making the rape allegation public if he did not agree to a legal settlement. Buzbee has said the letter was simply trying to set up a confidential mediation session.",
      "In a statement last week, Jay-Z said his \u201cheart and support goes out to true victims in the world.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Spiro accused Buzbee of \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the woman, while \"destroying this opportunity and the voices of real victims.\u201d",
      "In an emailed statement Monday, Buzbee said the woman had been referred to him by another law firm and vetted by four attorneys from his firm.",
      "\u201cCourts exist to resolve factual disputes,\u201d Buzbee added. \u201cOur client remains adamant about her claim.\u201d"

      "Up in the sky, is that a drone, a plane or a helicopter?",
      "Experts who study unmanned aircraft systems \u2014 better known as drones \u2014 say it can be tough to tell from miles away. But there are clues.",
      "A light in the sky at night can easily be misinterpreted, according to John Slaughter, director of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Research and Operations Center at the University of Maryland.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just walk outside and say, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s not a drone,\u2019 or \u2018That is one.\u2019 All you can really factually say is \u2018I saw a light in the sky,\u2019\" Slaughter said.",
      "Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights first spotted in New Jersey last month and now being seen across the U.S. have raised concerns among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility, and over President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s golf course in Bedminster.",
      "Planes and helicopters all have a flashing lights and typically at least one red anti-collision light, often two. They also sport navigation lights, which are steady, red and green colored lights like the ones found on boats. Many will also have flashing white strobe lights at their wingtips. And they have bright landing lights.",
      "Drones flying at night are only required to have one bright, anti-collision light that's visible 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. But drone owners can add other lights, so some have more than one. Drones are smaller, so when they have multiple lights they are close together, but at night it's often not possible to figure out precisely how far away they are.",
      "\"A light is just a bright point,\u201d Slaughter said. \u201cAnd it might be 100 yards (90 meters) away, it could be literally 40 miles (65 kilometers) away and it looks the same.\u201d",
      "Drones tend to be quieter and make a more high-pitched buzzing noise than what's generated by the jet engines or propellers that drive planes and helicopters. But bigger drones can be louder, and the sound may be difficult to discern from a distance.",
      "Drones heavier than about a half-pound (0.2 kilograms) may have an identifying number displayed on the outside.",
      "\u201cYou certainly wouldn\u2019t see it at night, and you\u2019d have to be up close to see it, you know, in the daytime,\u201d said Paul R. Snyder, director of the Unmanned Aircraft System program in the University of North Dakota's Aerospace Sciences School.",
      "Planes and even helicopters tend to move smoothly in the air, but multi-copter drones can stop on a dime, pivot 90 degrees and reverse course, Slaughter said.",
      "\u201cThat kind of motion can give you a clue that you\u2019re looking at a drone, not an aircraft,\" he said.",
      "And the vast majority of drones will be operating below 400 feet (122 meters), following federal regulations."

Kennedy Jr. swept onto Capitol Hill late Monday as the anti-vaccine health guru from the famous political family reintroduced himself to senators, this time as President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the nation's Health and Human Services Department.",
      "It was a soft-opening debut for Kennedy, whose wide-ranging views \u2014 yes to raw milk, no to fluoride, Ozempic and America's favorite processed foods \u2014 are raising alarms in the scientific community and beyond. In the Senate he's facing a mix of support, curiosity, skepticism and downright rejection among the senators who will be asked to confirm him to Trump's Cabinet.",
      "Kennedy's first stop Monday was on potentially friendly terrain, to the offices of a few GOP senators allied with Trump, the start of a robust, weeks-long process.",
      "One Republican, Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, said Kennedy told him, \u201cI 100% support the polio vaccination.\u201d But Mullin added that their conversation also turned to other childhood vaccinations. He predicts Kennedy will be confirmed.",
      "\u201cThe more you talk to him, the more he explains it, the more you like him,\u201d Mullin said.",
      "The man known simply as RFK, Jr., 70, is the latest in the Trump rival-turned-partner orbit, a former Democratic presidential hopeful now in line to run the world's largest public health agency, with its whopping $1.7 trillion budget, and some of the U.S. most important public services.",

      "Trump said Monday during his own press conference he\u2019s a \u201cbig believer\u201d in polio vaccines and sought to tamp down fears about Kennedy, saying he will be \u201cmuch less radical\u201d than people think.",
      "The incoming GOP leader, Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, said Kennedy will have to address questions about his views on the polio vaccine and other issues.",

      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination will test the nation\u2019s emerging political realignment, as Trump expands his base of supporters to include former Democratic voters shifting elsewhere. Kennedy\u2019s views find favor but also opposition from both sides of the political aisle.",
      "In particular, Kennedy's ideas about ridding the nation\u2019s food of additives has drawn interest if not support from some Democrats, but his criticism of major farm interests have also raised concerns from the agricultural industry.",

The president-elect's choice of Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary, Tulsi Gabbard for Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Kash Patel for FBI director and others are all running into turbulence from wary senators.",
      "With Republicans taking control of the Senate in the new year, Trump's nominees have a pathway to confirmation. But with just a 53-47 majority, any nominee can only lose a handful of GOP supporters, in the face of Democratic opposition.",

      "BOSTON -- Two men, including a dual Iranian American citizen, have been arrested on charges that they exported sensitive technology to Iran that was used in a drone attack in Jordan that killed three American troops early this year and injured dozens of other service members, the Justice Department said Monday.",
      "The pair were arrested after FBI specialists who analyzed the drone traced the navigation system to an Iranian company operated by one of the defendants, who relied on technology funneled from the U.S. by his alleged co-conspirator, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe often cite hypothetical risk when we talk about the dangers of American technology getting into dangerous hands,\u201d said U.S. Attorney Joshua Levy, the top federal prosecutor in Massachusetts. \u201cUnfortunately, in this situation, we are not speculating.\u201d",
      "The defendants were identified as Mahdi Mohammad Sadeghi, who prosecutors say works at a Massachusetts-based semiconductor company, and Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, who was arrested Monday in Italy as the Justice Department seeks his extradition to Massachusetts.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Abedininajafabadi, who also uses the surname Adedini and operates an Iranian company that manufactures navigation systems for drones, has connections to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. They allege that he conspired with Sadeghi to circumvent American export control laws, including through a front company in Switzerland, and procure sensitive technology into Iran.",
      "Both men are charged with export control violations, and Abedini separately faces charges of conspiring to provide material support to Iran. A lawyer for Sadeghi, a naturalized U.S. citizen who was arrested Monday in Massachusetts, did not immediately return an email seeking comment.",
      "U.S. officials blamed the January attack on the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group of Iran-backed militias that includes Kataib Hezbollah.",
      "Three Georgia soldiers \u2014 Sgt. William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Sgt. Breonna Moffett of Savannah and Sgt. Kennedy Sanders of Waycross \u2014 were killed in the Jan. 28 drone attack on a U.S. outpost in northeastern Jordan called Tower 22.",
      "In the attack, the one-way attack drone may have been mistaken for a U.S. drone that was expected to return back to the logistics base about the same time and was not shot down.",
      "Instead, it crashed into living quarters, killing the three soldiers and injuring more than 40.",
      "\u201cTo the people who were injured by this attack, to the loved ones and family members of the people who lost their lives, as the son of a combat veteran I humbly hope that today\u2019s charges bring some measure of justice and accountability,\u201d Levy said.",
      "Tower 22 held about 350 U.S. military personnel at the time. It is strategically located between Jordan and Syria, only 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the Iraqi border, and in the months just after Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and Israel\u2019s blistering response in Gaza, Iranian-backed militias intensified their attacks on U.S. military locations in the region.",
      "Following the attack, the U.S. launched a huge counterstrike against 85 sites in Iraq and Syria used by Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Iranian-backed militia and bolstered Tower 22\u2019s defenses.",

      "The federal lawsuit filed Thursday by Artis Whitehead, 61, says Memphis Police Department officers fabricated evidence that led to charges of armed robbery and kidnapping in the 2002 robbery of B.B. King's Blues Club on Beale Street.",
      "Whitehead, who is Black, was tried, convicted and sentenced in 2003 to 249 years in prison. But Whitehead's conviction and sentence were thrown out in December 2023 and he was released from prison. A Memphis judge determined that no physical evidence connected Whitehead to the robbery and that police fabricated information about the crime, including false identifications of Whitehead by club employees who had been held hostage and robbed.",
      "The fake evidence included an anonymous tip made by phone against Whitehead by a man detained for two different armed robberies, the lawsuit says. It claims the man who made the call was coerced by officers working the case.",
      "The lawsuit names as defendants the city of Memphis and officers involved in the investigation. It seeks a jury trial and unspecified damages for \u201closs of liberty, great mental anguish, humiliation, degradation, physical and emotional pain and suffering.\u201d",
      "During a news conference Monday, Whitehead said there is \"no price tag\u201d for what he and his family have experienced. Whitehead, who currently lives in Nashville and works two jobs, said he missed valuable time with his children and is in the process of re-establishing relations with them.",
      "The Memphis Police Department declined comment. The city of Memphis did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "On May 9, 2002, a robber entered B.B. King\u2019s and unsuccessfully tried to access the club's safe. The robber held five people hostage in the basement office, tying their hands and feet. One of the hostages was wounded when he was shot trying to take a gun from the robber, who took some of their money and jewelry before fleeing.",
      "Despite dozens of leads, officers ignored evidence, such as the correct description of the robber, and eliminated leads on suspects without justification, the lawsuit claims. Officers agreed to coerce a man suspected in other robberies into \u201chelping them fabricate an identification falsely implicating Mr. Whitehead\u201d by paying him and giving him an officer's cell phone to call in an anonymous tip.",
      "\u201cDefendants became desperate to pin the crime on someone in the face of mounting public and business community pressure,\u201d the lawsuit said.",
      "Whitehead's lawyers argued, among other things, that the actual robber was short and slim, while Whitehead was 6 feet tall and muscular. The judge who tossed out the conviction said there was no proof presented at trial that Whitehead had ever been to Beale Street or B.B. King\u2019s or that he was familiar with the building.",
      "The lawsuit was filed days after the U.S. Department of Justice released results of a monthslong investigation into the Memphis Police Department that was initiated after the January 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols by five police officers who were fired and charged in federal and state court.",
      "The investigation found that Memphis officers regularly use excessive force and discriminate against Black residents of the majority-Black city.",
      "\"Mr. Whitehead\u2019s wrongful conviction is not an isolated occurrence,\" the lawsuit said. \u201cRather, his odyssey through the criminal legal system was instigated by a Memphis Police Department that has and continues to devalue the lives of people of color.\u201d"

      "Efforts to save an imperiled 150-year-old lighthouse in New York are getting a boost with federal officials announcing new funding to study ways to protect the structure",
      "ATHENS, N.Y. -- Federal engineers will begin the process of preserving a functioning 150-year-old lighthouse that sits precariously on a mudflat in the middle of the Hudson River in New York, officials announced Monday.",
      "U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer and the Army Corps of Engineers said that $50,000 has been allocated to study how to protect the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse, which began operating in 1874 and was this year placed on the National Trust for Historic Preservation's list of the country\u2019s 11 most endangered historic places.",
      "Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he believes the development is the next step to securing all the money needed to save the structure, which is only years away from starting to crumble into the river due to ongoing erosion, according to preliminary studies by a historic preservation group.",
      "\u201cThis is a landmark, it\u2019s sort of like the Statue of Liberty in a certain sense, of the Hudson River,\u201d Schumer told The Associated Press by phone after announcing the new funding at a riverfront park in Athens, New York, which has a view of the lighthouse. \u201cWhen people see the lighthouse and learn its history, they learn the history of the country.\"",
      "The Corps of Engineers will now meet with the Hudson-Athens Lighthouse Preservation Society, which owns the building and maintains it as a museum, and agree on a plan to fix the property, Schumer said.",
      "He said the millions of dollars needed to ultimately rebuild the small island and preserve it are \u201cvirtually certain\u201d because it has been listed as a top priority for preservation.",
      "The lighthouse was built in the river 100 miles (161 kilometers) north of Manhattan to keep boats from running aground on mud flats between Athens, on the west side of the Hudson River, and the city of Hudson, on the east side. The lighthouse is still in use, though now with an automated LED beacon.",
      "It sits on roughly 200 wood pilings packed in mud beneath the water. Turbulence from passing commercial ships is washing away that mud and exposing the pilings to river water, accelerating decay.",
      "The society has proposed expanding the foundation the lighthouse is built on so that events can be held there and more visitors can walk on the island at once. It has been raising money to build a ring of corrugated steel designed to shield the structure from river turbulence.",
      "There were around 1,500 lighthouses in the U.S. at the beginning of the 20th century and only about 800 of them remain, according to the U.S. Lighthouse Society."

      "The U.S. Census Bureau is changing how it counts international migration in its annual population estimates",
      "The U.S. Census Bureau is changing how it counts immigrants in annual estimates by including more people who were admitted for humanitarian, and often temporary, reasons.",
      "The change is being made in an effort to better reflect population shifts this decade, officials said Monday. Population estimates, including immigration, are due to be released Thursday showing how the populations of the United States and the 50 states changed this year. However, the new approach to counting immigrants will only be reflected nationally.",
      "The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign born rose to its highest level in more than a century in 2023. It could be even higher under the new methodology. Census Bureau officials wouldn't say Monday how much larger they expected the immigration figures to be in Thursday's release because of the change.",
      "Capturing the number of new immigrants is the most difficult part of the annual U.S. population estimates. Although the newly announced change in methodology is unrelated, the timing comes a month before a return to the White House of President-elect Donald Trump, who has promised mass deportations of people in the United States illegally.",
      "\u201cWe feel confident that this was a good approach in order to make our estimates more current and reflect recent trends that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Eric Jensen, a senior research scientist at the Census Bureau.",
      "The bureau's annual calculation of how many migrants entered the United States in the 2020s has been much lower than the numbers cited by other federal agencies, such as the Congressional Budget Office. The Census Bureau estimated 1.1 million immigrants entered the United States in 2023, while the Congressional Budget Office's estimate was 3.3 million people.",
      "The group of people being included in the international migration estimates are those who enter the country through humanitarian parole, which has been granted for seven decades by Republican and Democratic presidential administrations to people unable to use standard immigration routes because of time pressure or their government\u2019s poor relations with the U.S. The Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based research organization, said last week that more than 5.8 million people were admitted under various humanitarian policies from 2021 to 2024.",
      "Trump appears certain to dismantle humanitarian parole, saying during his campaign that he would end the \u201coutrageous abuse of parole.\u201d The annual population estimates released by the Census Bureau each year are calculated from births, deaths, migration to the United States and migration between states. The population estimates provide the official population counts each year between the once-a-decade census for the United States, the 50 states, counties and metro areas. The figures are used for distributing trillions of dollars in federal funding.",

      "It also would impose fines on anyone helping an underage person gamble in New Jersey.",
      "The bill changes the penalties for underage gambling from that of a disorderly persons offense to a civil offense. Fines would be $500 for a first offense, $1,000 for a second offense, and $2,000 for any subsequent offenses.",
      "The money would be used for prevention, education, and treatment programs for compulsive gambling, such as those provided by the Council on Compulsive Gambling of New Jersey.",
      "\u201cThe concern I had initially was about reducing the severity of the punishment,\u201d said Assemblyman Don Guardian, a Republican former mayor of Atlantic City. \u201cBut the fact that all the money will go to problem gambling treatment programs changed my mind.\u201d",
      "Figures on underage gambling cases were not immediately available Thursday. But numerous people involved in gambling treatment and recovery say a growing number of young people are becoming involved in gambling, particularly sports betting as the activity spreads around the country.",
      "The bill was approved by an Assembly committee and now goes to the full Assembly for a vote. It must pass both houses of the Legislature before going to the desk of the state's Democratic governor, Phil Murphy.",

      "The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement said internet gambling brought in just over $214 million in November, narrowly eclipsing the previous record of $213 million set a month earlier.",
      "\u201cThe continuing success of online gaming and sports wagering has helped total gaming revenue achieve its best November monthly result in over a decade,\u201d said James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.",
      "But that's not necessarily great news for the casinos. They must share a substantial portion of internet and sports betting revenue with partners including sportsbooks and tech platforms.",
      "For that reason, the casinos consider money won from in-person gamblers to be their core business. And that business has not been terrific for years now.",
      "The casinos collectively matched their pre-pandemic in-person revenue total of $223.9 million in November. But only three casinos \u2014 Hard Rock, Ocean and Resorts, which barely exceeded its pre-pandemic level \u2014 won more from in-person gamblers in November than they did in Nov. 2019, before the COVID-19 outbreak began.",
      "The continuing surge in internet gambling represents a trend that has been present in New Jersey for several years now. It was accelerated by the pandemic, which forced the casinos to close for 3 1/2 months in 2020 and pushed many people to online alternatives that they have continued to use even in the years after the outbreak waned.",
      "November's $214 million in internet revenue was up nearly 25% from a year ago.",
      "Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling industry, noted that New Jersey's internet gambling market exceeded $200 million for the third month in a row.",
      "When internet and sports betting revenue is included, the casinos, two horse tracks that take sports bets and their online and tech partners won $556 million in November, an increase of 15.4%. That was helped by two additional weekend days in November that did not occur in November 2023.",
      "Borgata won a combined $122.6 million in November, up over 25% from a year earlier. Resorts won nearly $101 million, up nearly 28%; Golden Nugget won nearly $77 million, up 26%; Hard Rock won $63.5 million, up over 21%; Ocean won $39.8 million, up 8.6%; Bally's won $24.5 million, up over 24%; Harrah's won $18.5 million, down 4.4%; Tropicana won $16.6 million, down 7.3%, and Caesars won $16.5 million, down 7.4%.",
      "In terms of in-person revenue only, Borgata won $57.5 million, up 11.4% from a year earlier; Hard Rock won $44.3 million, up 7.1%; Ocean won $34 million, up 8.2%; Harrah's won $18.5 million, down 5.6%; Tropicana won $16.7 million, down 6.6%; Resorts won $13.9 million, up nearly 12%; Golden Nugget won $11.7 million, up 6.7%, and Bally's won $10.8 million, down 10.3%.",
      "Sports betting brought in nearly $119 million in revenue on $1.2 billion worth of bets.",
      "The Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, just outside New York City, had $50.5 million in sports betting revenue, down 12.3% from a year ago. It has a FanDuel sportsbook on the premises.",
      "Resorts, which is allied with DraftKings with a retail location and online operations, had nearly $38 million in sports betting revenue in November, nearly double the amount from a year earlier.",
      "Monmouth Park in Oceanport, near the Jersey Shore, had $2.5 million in sports betting revenue. That was up 163% from a year earlier, undoubtedly helped by the recent cessation of sports betting operations at a competing track in the same county, Freehold Raceway, which is closing at the end of this month.",

      "NEW YORK -- Former talk show host Carlos Watson was sentenced Monday to nearly 10 years in prison in a federal financial conspiracy case that cast his once-buzzy Ozy Media as an extreme of fake-it-'til-you-make-it startup culture.",
      "In one example, another Ozy executive impersonated a YouTube executive to hype Ozy to investment bankers \u2014 while Watson coached him, prosecutors said.",
      "Watson, 55, and the now-defunct company were found guilty last summer of charges including wire fraud conspiracy. He has denied the allegations and plans to appeal.",
      "\u201cI loved what we built with Ozy,\u201d he said in court Monday, initially addressing supporters in the audience before the judge suggested he turn around. Watson told the judge he was a target of \u201cselective prosecution\u201d as a Black entrepreneur in Silicon Valley, where African American executives have been disproportionately few, and he called the case \u201ca modern lynching.\u201d",
      "\u201cI made mistakes. I'm very, very sorry that people are hurt, myself included,\u201d he said, but \u201cI don't think it's fair.\u201d",
      "Watson, who faced a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison and potentially as much as 37 years, remains free for now on $3 million bond. He is to surrender to prison March 28. Any restitution will be determined after a hearing in February.",

      "\u201cYour internal apparatus for separating truth from fiction became badly miscalibrated,\u201d he told Watson in sentencing him.",
      "Prosecutors accused the former cable news commentator and host of playing a leading role in a scheme to deceive Ozy investors and lenders by inflating revenue numbers, touting deals and offers that were nonexistent or not finalized, and flashing other false indications of Ozy's success.",
      "Watson even listened in and texted talking points while his co-founder posed as a YouTube executive to praise Ozy on a phone call with potential investors, prosecutors said.",
      "\u201cHis incessant and deliberate lies demonstrated not only a brazen disregard for the rule of law, but also a contempt for the values of honesty and fairness that should underlie American entrepreneurship,\u201d Brooklyn-based U.S. Attorney Breon Peace said in a statement Monday. His office prosecuted the case.",
      "During the trial, Watson's defense blamed any misrepresentations on others, particularly co-founder Samir Rao and former Ozy chief of staff Suzee Han. She and Rao pleaded guilty, are awaiting sentencing and testified against Watson.",
      "Watson portrayed himself Monday as a founder who put everything he had into his company, saying that he took an average salary of around $51,000 from Ozy in its final years, has triple-mortgaged his home and drives a 15-year-old car.",
      "After court, he questioned why Brooklyn-based federal prosecutors had gone after a California-based company and founder. Prosecutors declined to comment; the indictment alleged that scheming happened in the Brooklyn-based jurisdiction and elsewhere.",
      "\u201cI do think this is an attack on Black excellence,\u201d Watson said after noting that his sentence wasn't far from the 11-year term meted out to Elizabeth Holmes. She's the white former Silicon Valley CEO convicted of duping investors in the Theranos blood-testing device hoax.",
      "There's no parallel between faking blood test results and Ozy's roster of real programs and events, Watson said.",
      "Ozy, founded in 2012, was styled as a hub of news and culture for millennials with a global outlook.",
      "Watson boasted an impressive resume: degrees from Harvard University and Stanford Law School, a stint on Wall Street, on-air gigs at CNN and MSNBC, and entrepreneurial chops. Ozy Media was his second startup, coming a decade after he sold a test-prep company that he had founded while in his 20s.",
      "Mountain View, California-based Ozy produced TV shows, newsletters, podcasts, and a music-and-ideas festival. Watson hosted several of the TV programs, including the Emmy-winning \u201cBlack Women OWN the Conversation,\u201d which appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Network.",
      "Ozy snagged big advertisers, clients and grants. But beneath the outward signs of success was an overextended company that struggled \u2014 and dissembled \u2014 to stay afloat after 2017, according to insiders' testimony.",
      "The company strained to make payroll, ran late on rent and took out pricey cash advances to pay bills, former finance vice president Janeen Poutre told jurors. Meanwhile, Ozy gave prospective investors much bigger revenue numbers than those it reported to accountants, according to testimony and documents.",
      "On the witness stand in July, Watson said the company's cash squeezes were just a startup norm and its investors knew they were getting unaudited numbers that could change.",
      "Only one of those investors spoke at the sentencing \u2014 Beverly Watson, who stands by her brother. She told the court Monday that her biggest loss was \u201cthis important platform that elevated people and ideas that weren't being heard before.\u201d",
      "Ozy disintegrated in 2021, after a New York Times column disclosed the phone-call impersonation gambit and raised questions about the true size of the startup's audience."

      "\u201cAs you know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d Trump said during a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. His campaign saw the platform as a way to reach younger, less politically engaged voters.",
      "Trump was meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at Mar-a-Lago on Monday, according to two people familiar with the president-elect\u2019s plans who were not authorized to speak publicly about them and spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.",
      "The companies have said that a shutdown lasting just a month would cause TikTok to lose about a third of its daily users in the U.S. and significant advertising revenue.",
      "The case could attract the court's interest because it pits free speech rights against the government's stated aims of protecting national security, while raising novel issues about social media platforms.",
      "The request first goes to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency appeals from courts in the nation's capital. He almost certainly will seek input from all nine justices.",
      "On Friday, a panel of federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an emergency plea to block the law, a procedural ruling that allowed the case to move to the Supreme Court.",
      "The same panel had earlier unanimously upheld the law over a First Amendment challenge claiming that it violated free speech rights.",
      "Without a court-ordered freeze, the law would take effect Jan. 19 and expose app stores that offer TikTok and internet hosting services that support it to potential fines.",
      "It would be up to the Justice Department to enforce the law, investigating possible violations and seeking sanctions. But lawyers for TikTok and ByteDance have argued that Trump's Justice Department might pause enforcement or otherwise seek to mitigate the law's most severe consequences. Trump takes office a day after the law goes into effect.",
      "The Supreme Court could temporarily put the law on hold so that the justices can give fuller consideration to First Amendment and other issues. They also could quickly schedule arguments and try to render a decision by Jan. 19.",
      "On the other hand, the high court could reject the emergency appeal, which would allow the law to take effect as scheduled.",
      "With that last prospect in mind, the companies' lawyers asked for a ruling on their emergency request by Jan. 6 because they'd need the time \u201cto coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States.\u201d",
      "The case has made a relatively quick trip through the courts once bipartisan majorities in Congress approved the law and President Joe Biden signed it in April.",

      "A former prison guard trainee has been sentenced to death for the 2019 execution-style killings of five women inside a Florida bank",
      "A former prison guard trainee who executed five women inside a Florida bank almost six years ago was sentenced to death on Monday as his judge called the slayings calculated, heinous and cruel.",
      "Zephen Xaver, 27, appeared to gulp but otherwise showed no emotion as Circuit Judge Angela Cowden pronounced the sentence at the Highlands County Courthouse in Sebring. After a two-week penalty trial, a jury in June voted 9-3 to recommend that Cowden sentence Xaver to death.",
      "Cowden said the weeks of planning that Xaver performed before the 2019 murders at Sebring's SunTrust bank, the enormity of the crime and the fear the victims felt as they were shot greatly outweighed the two dozen mitigating factors his attorneys had presented, including his history of mental illness, his benign brain tumor and his jailhouse embrace of Christianity.",
      "\u201cMay God have mercy on your soul,\u201d Cowden told Xaver.",
      "Xaver pleaded guilty last year to five counts of first-degree murder for the slayings of customer Cynthia Watson, 65; bank teller coordinator Marisol Lopez, 55; banker trainee Ana Pinon-Williams, 38; teller Debra Cook, 54; and banker Jessica Montague, 31.",
      "At gunpoint, Xaver ordered the women to lie on the floor and then shot each the head as they begged for mercy.",
      "Kiara Lopez told Xaver and the court that her mother Marisol had welcomed him into the bank with a smile, an act he repaid by murdering her.",
      "\u201cYou shattered me into a million pieces,\" Lopez said. \u201cI will celebrate the day you die, whenever that might be. Let it be known that you will always be a killer, a coward, a nobody and a waste of human life.\u201d",
      "Michael Cook, Debra's husband, also called Xaver a coward and told the judge, \u201cI have absolutely no sympathy for him.\u201d",
      "Xaver\u2019s lead public defender, Jane McNeill, had asked that Cowden spare her client, saying a life sentence would put an end to the case instead of dragging it out for a decade of appeals and possibly a retrial if the sentence is overturned.",
      "\u201cThe only way for this matter to be brought to an end so that the families of the victims and this community is able to move forward is a life sentence,\u201d McNeill argued. The sentence will be automatically appealed.",
      "Under a new Florida law, death penalty sentences can be rendered by a jury vote of 8-4 rather than a unanimous recommendation. The change was adopted after the 2018 Parkland high school shooter could not be sentenced to death for murdering 17 people despite a 9-3 jury vote. McNeill called the new law unconstitutional.",
      "Xaver moved to Sebring, a city of about 11,000, in 2018 from near South Bend, Indiana. In 2014, his high school principal contacted police after Xaver told others he was having dreams about hurting his classmates. His mother promised to get him psychological help.",
      "He joined the Army in 2016. A former girlfriend, who met him at a mental hospital where they were patients, told police he said joining the military was a \u201cway to kill people and get away with it.\u201d The Army discharged him after three months. In 2017, a Michigan woman reported him after he sent her text messages suggesting he might commit \u201csuicide by cop\u201d or take hostages.",
      "Despite his psychological problems and dismissal from the Army, Florida hired Xaver as a guard trainee in November 2018 at a prison near Sebring. He quit two months later, two weeks before the shootings and the day after he bought his gun.",
      "Hours before the murders, Xaver began a long, intermittent text message conversation with a former girlfriend in Connecticut, telling her \u201cthis is the best day of my life\u201d but refusing to say why. Fifteen minutes before the shootings, he texted her, \u201cI\u2019m dying today,\u201d",
      "Then, from the bank parking lot he texted, \u201cI\u2019m taking a few people with me because I\u2019ve always wanted to kill people so I am going to try it and see how it goes. Watch for me on the news.\u201d"

    "summary": "Bates hopes sub-postmasters can get closure as the inquiry's evidence hearings come to an end.",
    "story": [
      "Campaigner Sir Alan Bates has said he wants the \"real baddies\" involved in the Post Office scandal to be held to account.",
      "He said \"many of us know who the guilty ones are\" in relation to the Horizon IT scandal, where more than 900 sub-postmasters were prosecuted for shortfalls caused by bugs in an accounting system.",
      "Sir Alan spoke as a long-running inquiry into what is considered one of the most widespread miscarriages in British justice heard final submissions.",
      "Lawyers acting for sub-postmasters told the inquiry on Monday the Post Office's \"cruel\" and \"malignant culture\" had \"destroyed the innocent\".",
      "In an interview with the BBC's World at One programme, Sir Alan said that he hoped public scrutiny would ensure justice was done.",
      "Between 1999 and 2015, hundreds were wrongly prosecuted after Fujitsu's faulty Horizon IT accounting system made it look like money was missing.",
      "Many lost their livelihoods or were forced to make up shortfalls, while others have described feeling ostracised from their communities. Some former sub-postmasters took their own lives.",
      "On Monday, Edward Henry KC, representing victims, said: \"The truth is this tragedy is not about an IT system. Horizon did not destroy the innocent \u2013 the malignant culture of the Post Office did.\"",
      "\"People were ruined, people were bankrupted, people were imprisoned, there were atrocious miscarriages of justice, people died,\" he said.",
      "His statement marked the beginning of the end of the inquiry which was set up in September 2020 to look at the Post Office scandal.",
      "It has heard from 298 witnesses, received 780 witness statements and dealt with more than 2.2 million pages of disclosure.",
      "Witnesses have included Paula Vennells, the former chief executive of the Post Office, who has been widely criticised for her handling of the matter.",
      "Summing up, Mr Henry told the inquiry: \"The greatest horrors of the world, man's cruelty to man, are not caused by monsters, malfunctions or misfortune but by those who claim to act in the name of good.\"",
      "At the beginning of the year, the ITV drama Mr Bates versus the Post Office captured the public's imagination and won a number of awards by focussing on the human stories behind the scandal.",
      "Sir Alan said that \"the country will be holding quite a few people to account on this and they will want to see real justice\" as a result.",
      "He also said that he hopes the inquiry's chair, Sir Wyn Williams, would \"name names in this one\".",
      "Sir Wyn's final report on the scandal is due to be published next year, but Sir Alan said he was worried it could be \"put on a shelf\" and that little would happen afterwards.",
      "As Sir Wyn considers all the information, one of the barristers representing the victims, Sam Stein KC, requested that the inquiry should remain involved, particularly in holding the Post Office and the Department for Business to account for compensation payments.",
      "Waiting for redress",
      "While the inquiry draws to a close, many former Post Office branch managers are still waiting to finalise compensation due to them 25 years after the scandal began.",
      "Sir Alan said that his most recent offer on redress, which he has rejected, was worth a third of his original claim. The first redress offer was for one sixth of his original claim, he said.",
      "His claim was now with Sir Ross Cranston, a former High Court Judge, who is the Independent Reviewer of the GLO Post Office scheme, he said.",
      "He said that many sub-postmasters were hoping to \"put it behind them\", but that they would continue to \"see it through\".",
      "The inception, roll out and subsequent issues with Horizon spanned Conservative governments, Labour governments, and a Tory and Lib-Dem coalition.",
      "Tim Moloney KC in his summing up on Monday said \"successive governments contributed to the position of crisis and commercial hunger which drove the Post Office as an institution and individuals within it to lose sight of the true value of the network and the individuals within it\".",
      "Sir Keir Starmer has responded to letters sent by the former sub-postmaster Sir Alan Bates, while a No 10 spokesman has said that the government is committed to getting quick redress for victims.",
      "They have, however, said they were wary of setting an \"arbitrary cut-off\" date that could see some claimants miss out.",
      "Neil Sheldon KC for UK Government Investments (UKGI), the government body which owns the Post Office, said it \"should have provided more robust challenge and, had we shown more curiosity, the legitimate concerns raised by sub-postmasters... may have been given more weight\".",
      "\"For that... we apologise unreservedly.\"",
      "He admitted people in government might not have understood what powers they had to hold the Post Office to account. These include dismissing the chair or bringing the chair and chief executive in to talk about the direction of the group.",
      "However, he also defended UKGI, saying there was no evidence of any employee \"ever having deliberately sought to victimise postmasters, hide the truth or engage in any form of cover-up\".",

    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump pitching the US as a great place for business,  firms around the world are figuring out how to answer his call.",
      "Japanese tech billionaire Masayoshi Son, a colourful character known as much for his major flops as his big accomplishments, presented one path on Monday, appearing with Trump at a press conference and pledging to invest $100bn (\u00a379bn) over four years and create 100,000 jobs.",
      "\"He's a great negotiator,\" the CEO said, laughing on stage as Trump pressed him to double his commitment.",
      "But plenty of questions remain about Mr Son's venture, especially in light of the lack of details he provided and the record of similar investments during Trump's first term.",
      "Mr Son has previously discussed the opportunity he sees in artificial intelligence, and Bloomberg reported in February that he was planning a $100bn chip venture.",
      "But his Softbank Group had only about a third of that, $30bn, in cash earlier this year and its global reputation has taken large hits after previous bets, such as a major investment in co-working firm WeWork, imploded.",
      "With the cameras rolling at Mar-a-Lago, Mr Son avoided giving specifics about how he would fund his promise.",
      "Nor did Trump demand details, casting the pledge primarily as a sign of a wider renewal in business optimism, which has been reported in surveys in recent weeks.",
      "\"This historic investment is a monumental demonstration of confidence in America's future,\" the president-elect said.",
      "Trump has indicated that when he returns to the White House he plans to use the bully pulpit to court foreign investment.",
      "His campaign promises to slash both taxes and regulations have already boosted Wall Street and charged up big business to pursue large-scale ambitions.",
      "Specifically, Trump has said he would cut taxes for companies that make products in the US and speed approvals for firms investing $1bn or more.",
      "Investors expect him to green-light takeovers and pull back on enforcing antitrust laws, as well.",
      "Still, there are concerns about Trump's campaign promises to crack down on immigration, which could affect the workforce, and raise tariffs on imports from China, Mexico and Canada. On top of that, he has discussed rolling back manufacturing and energy incentives put in place by President Joe Biden, which some investors like.",
      "Political leaders from both parties often promote business investments and will often take some credit when those ventures boom. President Joe Biden, for example, visited projects by companies such as chipmaker TSMC to highlight historic incentives the government approved for green energy and high-tech firms.",
      "Monday's event recalled pageantry familiar from Trump's first term in office, which was punctuated by high-profile announcements of investments. Many of those planned projects had been in the works already or were hazy in their chances of becoming reality.",
      "Those included Taiwanese semiconductor giant Foxconn's plans to build up a technology park in Wisconsin, which Trump had boasted would become the \"eighth wonder of the world\". Instead of creating more than 13,000 jobs and spending more than $10bn, the company created less than 1,000 jobs and spent around $1bn, according to CNBC.",
      "Trump had also said he would save a failed car factory in Lordstown, Ohio, with an electric vehicle start-up backed by Foxconn and had celebrated promises to create a million jobs over five years made by Alibaba's Jack Ma.",
      "The car company - Lordstown Motors - filed for bankruptcy and reorganized to become Nu Ride Inc earlier this year.",
      "Meanwhile, Alibaba has said it \"supported\" 403,000 US jobs in 2022, five years after Mr Ma made his promise.",
      "Mr Son's relationship with Trump also dates back to his first election.",
      "Shortly after Trump took the White House, the two men appeared together to discuss $50bn Mr Son planned to invest in the US, as his firm was evolving into a kind of technology venture-capital firm.",
      "Its current holdings include US telecom firm T-Mobile and UK microchip designer Arm."

      "His biggest fear was of someday needing to have his foot amputated. Vision loss, another possible complication of diabetes, wasn\u2019t really on his radar. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d lose my sight,\u201d says Quinn, who lives in West Yorkshire.",
      "But one day he noticed bleeding in his eye. Doctors told him he had diabetic retinopathy: diabetes-related damage to blood vessels in the retinas. This required laser treatments and then injections.",
      "Eventually the treatments weren\u2019t enough to prevent the deterioration of his vision. He would hurt his shoulder walking into lampposts. He couldn\u2019t make out his son\u2019s face. And he had to give up driving.",
      "\u201cI felt pathetic. I felt like this shadow of a man that couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he remembers.",
      "One thing that helped him climb out of his despair was the support of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which connected him with a black Labrador named Spencer. \u201cHe saved my life,\u201d says Quinn, who is now a fundraiser for Guide Dogs.",
      "In the UK the NHS invites patients for diabetic eye screening every one or two years.",
      "US guidelines are that every adult with type 2 diabetes should be screened at diagnosis of diabetes, and then annually if there are no issues. Yet for many people, that doesn\u2019t happen in practice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very clear evidence that screening prevents vision loss,\u201d says Roomasa Channa, a retina specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.",
      "In the US barriers include cost, communication and convenience. Dr Channa believes that making the tests easier to access would help patients.",
      "To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.",
      "Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is \u201ca lot of repetitive work\u201d, Dr Channa says.",
      "But some think that artificial intelligence (AI) could speed up the process and make it cheaper.",
      "Diabetic retinopathy develops in fairly clear stages, which means that AI can be trained to pick it up.",
      "In some cases, AI could decide whether a referral to an eye specialist is needed, or work in tandem with human image graders.",
      "One such system was developed by the health technology company Retmarker, based in Portugal.",
      "Its system identifies fundus images that could be problematic and sends them to a human expert for further investigation.",
      "\u201cNormally we use it more as a support tool to give information to the human to make a decision,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Diogo Ramos, Retmarker\u2019s chief executive.",
      "He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this.",
      "Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk\u2019s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity.",
      "Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease.",
      "In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems.",
      "Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy.",
      "It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios.",
      "One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training.",
      "Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people.",
      "Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool.",

      "Cost is a very important aspect of the new technology.",
      "Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around \u20ac5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher.",
      "In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives.",
      "The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over.",
      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.",
      "Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn\u2019t the case for the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",
      "She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect.",
      "But even with those caveats, \u201cthe technology is very exciting,\u201d says Dr Channa.",
      "\u201cI would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.\u201d",
      "Back in Yorkshire, Mr Quinn certainly hopes the new tech takes off.",

      "When all the trimmings are totted up, a family Christmas is set to cost \u00a331.66 in 2024, down from last year's figure of \u00a332.18. It reflects food prices rising at a slower rate in the past year, as UK inflation has eased.",

      "The crown of the Christmas feast, the turkey, has fallen in price by 6% this year, according to this data.",
      "Tom Copas, managing director of Copas Turkeys in Cookham, Berkshire, said the price of turkeys had begun to stabilise after a couple of \"incredibly turbulent\" years that had pushed up the cost of rearing his birds.",

    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 04:11:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Builders and developers say reforms are needed to recruit more tradespeople to build the homes being promised.",
    "story": [
      "The UK does not have enough construction workers to build the 1.5 million homes the government has promised, industry leaders have warned.",
      "Tens of thousands of new recruits are needed for bricklaying, groundworks and carpentry to get anywhere near the target, they told the BBC.",
      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",
      "Based on the government's plans, the estimated number of new workers required for some common trades, for example, would be:",
      "20,000 bricklayers2,400 plumbers8,000 carpenters3,200 plasterers20,000 groundworkers1,200 tilers2,400 electricians2,400 roofers480 engineers",
      "20,000 bricklayers",
      "2,400 plumbers",
      "8,000 carpenters",
      "3,200 plasterers",
      "20,000 groundworkers",
      "1,200 tilers",
      "2,400 electricians",
      "2,400 roofers",
      "480 engineers",
      "The HBF said while the industry had \"the capacity to deliver current build levels, tens of thousands of new people will need to be recruited if we are to reach the targets set out\".",
      "When asked if there were enough workers currently to build the extra homes, David Thomas, chief executive of Barratt Redrow, said: \"The short answer is no.\"",
      "He told the BBC the government would have to \"revolutionise the market, revolutionise planning, revolutionise methods of production\" for their target to be met.",
      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",
      "But the HBF also said the UK \"does not have a sufficient talent pipeline\" of builders to employ. It cited several recruitment constraints, including a poor perception and lack of training within schools, not enough apprenticeships and the costs of taking on apprentices.",
      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",
      "Barratt Redrow boss Mr Thomas said recruitment had not been helped by a drive in past decades to encourage young people into further education rather than trades.",
      "\"If you went back to the 60s and 70s, I think parents, teachers, and the government were very happy with the idea that people became trades - electricians, plumbers, bricklayers,\" he said.",
      "The average rates of pay for these jobs \"are high\" but the issue was \"more about availability of labour with skills, he said.",
      "An experienced bricklayer can earn around \u00a345,000 per year, while carpenters are paid about \u00a338,000 and electricians \u00a344,000, according to government figures.",
      "Where does the government want 1.5 million new homes?",
      "Starmer's plan to solve housing crisis faces first big test",
      "Skills shortages have been an issue in the UK for some time, but the gap had been partially plugged in recent decades with workers from the European Union - a recruitment pool which has dried up after freedom of movement ended as a result of Brexit.",
      "The HBF said 40 to 50% of skilled workers had also left the industry following the 2008 financial crash and \"restrictions\" had made it harder to recruit from overseas.",
      "Mr Thomas said historically the building sector had recruited a significant number of bricklayers from eastern EU countries, admitting that \"in hindsight\", the UK had been over-reliant on overseas workers but it had been the \"norm\".",
      "According to the industry's latest census, Romania, India and Poland were the most common countries of origin for construction workers from overseas. More than half of London's construction workforce are EU/EEA nationals.",
      "Last month, the government announced \u00a3140m of funding to create 5,000 more construction apprenticeship places per year and established \"homebuilding skills hubs\" to fast-track training.",
      "A government spokesperson said the skills hubs showed it wanted to \"make sure this country takes skilled careers like construction seriously\".",
      "But ministers received a blow to its plans from local councils, charged with implementing the new targets in their areas, who said they were \"unrealistic\" and \"impossible to achieve\".",
      "The independent think tank Centre for Cities also estimated the housebuilders will fall 388,000 short of the government's 1.5m target.",
      "But both Barratt Redrow and the HBF have welcomed the government plans. The HBF said \"a more pro-development policy approach\" would enable the industry to \"invest in the people and land needed to increase housing supply\".",
      "Despite recruitment challenges, Barratt Redrow is planning to build between 16,600 and 17,200 in the next financial year, almost 4,000 more than what Barratt itself forecast, before the merger with Redrow in October.",

      "Ms Djerf, 27, told the BBC she was \"deeply sorry\" to anyone who has felt mistreated under her leadership.",
      "But customers like 22-year-old Sumi Mrkulic have vowed to \"never purchase anything or voice support again\".",
      "'Performative and spineless'",
      "Sumi, from London, said she was particularly concerned after Aftonbladet reported that some models were told they didn't fill out a pair of jeans, while others were called fat.",
      "Djerf Avenue's website promotes a world \"filled with kindness, inspiration, and respect,\" and the brand is known for its size inclusivity and diverse model representation.",
      "Sumi told the BBC: \"It renders all of their efforts to be inclusive completely performative. I actually find it really spineless.\"",
      "Influencer Matilda Djerf launched the brand in 2019 and it quickly became popular with young women. It says it made around $35m (\u00a327.5m) in revenue last year.",
      "It recently held its first 10-day pop-up shop in London, which saw queues forming up to three hours before the store opened.",
      "'Betrayal of values'",
      "Giulia Carrozzo, 20, from Germany, received an order from Djerf Avenue the day before the allegations emerged. She said she would be sending it back in light of the report.",
      "\"Djerf Avenue has always marketed itself as a body-positive, inclusive and empowering brand, so hearing allegations of body-shaming and a toxic work environment felt like a complete betrayal of the values they claim to uphold,\" she said.",

      "\"I can't justify supporting a brand that doesn't practise the values it promotes. Until there's real accountability and change, I won't be purchasing from them.\"",
      "'Take criticism very seriously'",
      "Matilda Djerf said in a statement: \"If any team member has felt mistreated in their role because of my actions, I am deeply sorry, and I want to sincerely apologize.",
      "\"I don't recognize myself in all the claims that have been made, and I've chosen not to comment on individual cases. However, I do believe it's valuable that these concerns are being raised, as it gives both me and Djerf Avenue the opportunity to grow and improve.",
      "\"I want to emphasize that I take full responsibility and see this as a chance to reflect, grow, and contribute to a better culture for everyone at Djerf Avenue.\"",
      "Djerf Avenue's chief operating officer, Pernilla Bonny, said the company acknowledged the challenges in its workplace environment and had taken steps to address them.",

      "The name of this pact - CPTPP - is a mouthful, but it's a club of more than 500 million people the UK will have greater access to.",
      "So what does it mean for businesses and households?",
      "What is the CPTPP?",
      "The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) is a trade agreement between 11 nations: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.",
      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",
      "The UK is the first non-founding country to join, and will be the pact's second biggest economy after Japan. It takes the value of the new grouping to \u00a311 trillion.",
      "Representatives from CPTPP countries signed the rebranded Pacific trade pact in March 2018",
      "What's in it for the UK?",
      "The short-term gains are marginal.",
      "The UK already had deals with the majority of these nations as part of its EU membership which have been carried over.",
      "Since Brexit, the UK has added Australia and New Zealand to its trade deal tally.",
      "It was just Brunei and Malaysia left that the UK didn't have a deal with and between them those two account for less than 0.5% of the total of UK trade.",
      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",
      "Also, manufacturers that get components from lots of different places can claim their products qualify for preferential treatment.",
      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",
      "In return, countries must co-operate on regulations, such as food standards.",
      "However, unlike the European Union, the CPTPP is neither a single market nor a customs union.",
      "So countries are not required to have identical regulations and standards.",
      "And countries can strike their own trade deals with others, as the UK has with the EU - although membership of the CPTPP would not be compatible with re-joining the EU itself.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "In short, what has the UK had to agree to as the price of admission?",
      "Some, including members of a House of Lords committee, want to know how the UK intends, for example, to ensure environmental and animal welfare standards will be met.",
      "The government has pointed out that CPTPP allows members to set their own levels of protection and it would not compromise the UK's standards.",
      "As part of the agreement, the UK will grant Canadian farmers more access to UK markets - but hormone-treated meat will still be banned.",
      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",
      "The agreement will loosen restrictions on services and digital trade, which matches the UK's ambitions, and ties it in with some of the faster-growing nations.",
      "But the biggest rewards - and challenges - could occur if others join the club.",
      "China is among those vying to sign up, as is Taiwan.",
      "Could the UK veto China's membership? Or use its membership to shape China's access and ambitions?",
      "The real prize would be if the US reverses the decision made by President Trump not to sign up.",
      "America buys about double the amount of UK exports than the current CPTPP nations put together, but membership doesn't appear to be on President Biden's to-do list.",
      "At present, membership of the CPTPP is a mainly symbolic win for post-Brexit Britain.",

      "\"Letter delays leave millions of people missing urgent medical appointment letters, legal documents and benefit decisions,\" said Tom MacInnes, its director of policy.",

      "However, Ofcom said: \"We do not consider either of these to be justifiable reasons for Royal Mail's failure to provide the levels of service expected of it.",
      "\"Royal Mail took insufficient and ineffective steps to try and prevent this failure, which is likely to have impacted millions of customers who did not get the service they paid for.\"",

      "While there had been some progress, it said the improvement in 2023-24 had only been marginal and \"it needs to do much better\".",

    "story": [
      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 00:08:26 GMT",
    "summary": "AI can create digital humans and digital organs that can be used in clinical trials.",
    "story": [
      "This is the first of a six-part series on how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "The heart in front of me beats and moves like a human organ, but has no blood flowing through it, nor does it live in a human body.",
      "It's a computer-generated heart, or digital twin, used to test implantable cardiovascular devices, like stents, and prosthetic valves that, once confirmed they are safe, will eventually be used on real people.",
      "But the heart's creators, Adsilico, have gone beyond just creating one accurate model.",
      "Using artificial intelligence and huge amounts of data, they have created multiple different hearts.",
      "These AI-generated synthetic hearts can be made to reflect not just biological attributes like weight, age, gender and blood pressure, but health conditions and ethnic backgrounds.",
      "As these differences often aren\u2019t represented in clinical data, digital twin hearts can help device manufacturers conduct trials across more diverse populations than they could with human trials, or trials involving just digital twins without AI.",
      "\u201cThis allows us to capture the full diversity of patient anatomies and physiological responses, which is not possible using conventional methods. This use of AI to enhance device testing leads to the development of devices that are more inclusive and safer,\u201d says Adsilico chief executive Sheena Macpherson.",
      "In 2018 an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists revealed that 83,000 deaths and over 1.7 million injuries were caused by medical devices.",
      "Ms Macpherson hopes that AI powered digital twins can cut down those numbers.",
      "\u201cTo really make these devices safer, you need to test them more thoroughly, and it isn't feasible to do that in a clinical trial environment due to the expense of it,\" says Ms Macpherson, who is based in Northumberland.",
      "\"So you want to be able to use the computer-generated version, to make sure that whatever you're doing, you've tested it as thoroughly as possible before you test it on a human.",
      "\u201cEven a fraction of those deaths - and the associated lawsuits - could have been avoided with more thorough testing. You can also get more detailed results.",
      "\"You could take the same [virtual] heart and you could test under low or high blood pressure, or against different disease progression, to see whether that affects the device in any way.\u201d",
      "Ms Macpherson adds: \u201c[Virtual] testing gives medical device manufacturers many more insights. It also means that we can test in other sub patient groups, not just white men which clinical trials have traditionally been based on.\u201d",
      "Adsilico\u2019s AI models are trained on a combination of cardiovascular data, and data from real MRI and CT scans, that includes medical imaging from consenting patients.",
      "The data draws from detailed anatomical structures of the heart, to help create accurate digital representations of how medical devices will interact with different patient anatomies.",
      "Adsilico\u2019s trials involve the creation of a digital twin of the device to be tested, which is then inserted into the virtual heart in an AI-generated simulation.",
      "It all takes place inside a computer, where the test can be replicated across thousands of other hearts - all AI-simulated versions of a real human heart. Human and animal trials, on the other hand, tend to involve just hundreds of participants.",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Perhaps the biggest incentive for drug and device manufacturers to supplement clinical trials with AI digital twins is how it reduces the time it takes, which translates into big cost savings, too.",
      "Drug manufacturer Sanofi, for example, hopes to reduce the testing period by 20%, while also increasing the success rate. It is using digital twin technology in its immunology, oncology and rare disease specialism.",
      "Using biological data from real people, Sanofi creates AI-based simulated patients - not actual clones of specific individuals - that can be interspersed across the control and placebo groups within the trial.",
      "Sanofi\u2019s AI programmes also then creates computer-generated models of the drug to be tested, synthesising properties like how the drug would be absorbed across the body, so it can be tested on the AI patients. The programme predicts their reactions, too - replicating the real trial process.",
      "\u201cWith a 90% failure rate across the industry of new drugs during clinical development, an increase of just 10% in our success rate by using technologies like digital twins could result in $100m in savings, given the high cost of running late phase clinical trials,\u201d says Matt Truppo, Sanofi\u2019s global head of research platforms and computational research and development.",
      "The results so far have been promising, Mr Truppo, who is based in Boston, US, adds.",
      "\u201cThere is still a lot to do. Many of the diseases we are now trying to impact are highly complex. This is where tools like AI come in. Powering the next generation of digital twins with accurate AI models of complex human biology is the next frontier.\u201d",
      "Digital twins might have weaknesses though, says Charlie Paterson, an associate partner at PA Consulting and a former NHS service manager.",
      "He points out that the twins are only as good as the data that they are trained on.",
      "\"[Due to] aged data collection methods, and low representation of marginalised populations, we could end up in a position where we could still be introducing some of those biases when we're programming virtual recreations of individuals.\u201d",
      "Working with limited legacy data to train its AI is an issue Sanofi is aware of and working to resolve.",
      "To fill gaps in its internal data sets - made up of millions of data points from the thousands of patients that undergo its trials each year - it sources data from third parties, like electronic health records and biobanks.",
      "Back at Adsilico, Ms Macpherson is hopeful that one day AI digital twin technology will eliminate animal testing from clinical trials, which is still currently considered an essential part of the drug and device testing process.",
      "\u201cA virtual model of our hearts is still closer to a human heart than that of a dog, cow, sheep, or pig, which tends to be what they use for implantable device studies,\u201d she says.",

      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",

      "Toby has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), he explains, and requires a very flexible schedule, allowing him to spend a few minutes or a few hours on an activity, or learn \"on the move\" so he is not confined to sitting at a desk.",
      "Two of Daniel's older children, who are both autistic, are doing well at a special school but he says that Toby's educational needs aren't severe enough to qualify him for a place.",
      "\"I don't claim to be a great teacher,\" he continues. \"But I've got enough creativity and inquisitiveness to find learning opportunities as we go.\"",
      "They start the day with 20 minutes of reading. On the day we meet, they're looking at a storybook full of illustrations. Their week so far has also included gymnastics, ice-skating and forest walks.",
      "As Daniel explains all of this, Toby is busy figuring out a puzzle in a maths workshop in a meeting room near their south London home with a group of other home-educated children.",
      "Post-pandemic: a perfect storm",
      "Covid lockdowns gave families a glimpse into the world of home education, as video communication technology suddenly became commonplace in many schools. Digital learning businesses and online schools sprung up too.",
      "What followed was a perfect storm: as schools re-opened, some children found the transition back to the classroom difficult, resulting in an increase in persistently absent children - around double the levels seen before the pandemic.",
      "The latest figures from the Department for Education show that nearly one in five children missed school more than 10% of the time in the autumn and spring terms of 2023/24.",
      "Earlier this month, Sir Martyn Oliver, the chief inspector of Ofsted, England's schools regulator, said that the issue of children missing school was a \"stubborn and damaging issue\", and expressed concern over \"flexi-schooling\", where parents educate their children at home for part of the week.",
      "\"Even ten years ago [many people had] quite an idealised vision of home education involving self-directed learners who go off to Cambridge,\" explains Amber Fensham-Smith, co-director of the Open University's Children's Research Centre. \"The situation is a lot more complex now.\"",
      "\"It's plugging a gap,\" she continues. \"If your child is struggling with their mental health, you can't get an NHS referral and you want to keep them safe, what do you do? That's very different to a parent who chooses it.\"",
      "The Department for Education says it knows \"far too many children with SEND aren't having their needs met\" and recently announced \u00a3740m of funding to increase the number of places for pupils within mainstream schools.",
      "More than 1.6 million children have SEND in schools in England, an increase of 101,000 from 2023. Experts say there are various reasons for this, including greater awareness.",
      "In October, the public spending watchdog warned the special educational needs system is broken and families have lost confidence in it. Which begins to explain part of the spike in home education.",
      "What remains unclear is how effective this is as a solution.",
      "In the US, a much larger proportion of the population - an estimated 6% of children - learn at home, and studies there have found that home-educated children perform as well as, or outperform, their peers in most academic tests.",
      "However, some experts point to the fact that participants in surveys tend to be in highly educated, middle-class families with internet access, which leaves out under-represented groups.",
      "In the UK, the Education Committee called on the government in 2021 to commission research on the life chances and social outcomes of home-educated children \u2013 but three years later, the research is still limited.",
      "One challenge with measuring success in the UK is that there is no obligation for home-educated children to follow the national curriculum or sit exams. Parents simply have a duty to provide a \"suitable education\".",
      "Earlier this month, the Education Policy Institute, an independent research organisation, warned that a lack of clarity around the law and what is required, \"potentially risks some children missing out,\" and that not knowing who or where they are \"raises questions about variation in the quality and suitability of home education.\"",
      "Others argue that there should be, for example, a minimum bar required for literacy and numeracy.",
      "But Fadoua Govaerts, who taught her five children at home and has a PhD from the University of Bath that focused on home-education experiences, believes that it's right for it to have the flexibility to be \"more holistic and inclusive\".",
      "\"Outcomes could be anything from being comfortable within their own skin, finding a new talent, become an elite athlete or actor, to gaining national qualifications or becoming an entrepreneur as a teenager,\" she says.",
      "What the children say",
      "Riyad Ozpolat has never been to school. He is 12 years old now and lives in Bristol with his parents and four siblings. His mother Weronika, a speech and language therapist, works one day a week at a school and the rest of the time home-educates three of her children.",
      "\"I've been home-schooled my whole life\", explains Riyad, as he swings on an office chair, while his 18-month old sister wanders around behind him. \"The reason I don't want to go to school is because I don't know if I'll be able to cope with sitting down.\"",
      "He sees his best friends every week at Scouts and says that he doesn't feel he's missing out on anything.",
      "Ms Ozpolat says that home-educating her children gives them a chance to focus on their passions. \"There's so much wasted time at school. I think the earlier that they can focus on their interests the better because it just means they have more expertise and extra knowledge in the thing they want to do when they're older\".",
      "However, she continues: \"As the children get older, we need to pay for them to do the GCSE exams. If they're having extra tuition and you have to pay for all of the books and resources that you need to get in order to do the exam.\"",
      "'I tried everything to get my daughter to go to school'",
      "Homeschooling mum teaches kids while travelling",
      "More families being 'forced' into home education",
      "Parents who choose to home-educate take on full financial responsibility - there is no specific government support for home education.",
      "Children who are home-educated are not obliged by law to sit their GCSE exams, but if they choose to, they normally have to pay an exam board fee and an exam centre fee. Prices vary widely but for example the total cost of sitting all three GCSE maths papers at one private exam centre in London, would be \u00a3225.",
      "Then there is the question around whether a home education always prepares people well for certain workplaces. Rachael Barrow, who is now 31, was home-educated for nine years after being bullied in school, and says she loved being taught away from the traditional classroom, but when she entered the workplace she found certain challenges.",
      "During her first job, in human resources, she struggled to adjust to having a fixed routine. \"I felt as though I was losing some of my autonomy in deciding my own schedule\", she says.",
      "She has since changed careers and is now completing a PhD at Lancaster University. As part of this she has interviewed other adults who were previously home-educated, and found they tended to avoid corporate careers or 9-5 jobs.",
      "Some told her that \"politics in the workplace\" was a struggle.",
      "However she is positive about the experience overall: \"I don't regret being home-educated at all\", she says. \"I think it set me up quite nicely for a career in academia.\"",
      "Safeguarding and registers",
      "Some critics argue that there are gaps around regulating home-education in the UK. The current rules don't require a parent to tell the council if they are home-educating their child from the start; they only stipulate that a school must tell the local authority if a child has been de-registered.",
      "\"The UK is an absolute outlier in being the least regulated in Europe,\" says Daniel Monk, professor of law at Birkbeck, University of London.",
      "The death of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, who was removed from school by her father and stepmother to be home-educated, after her teachers raised concerns with social services, has added to the debate around strengthening regulation.",
      "Dame Rachel de Souza, the Children's Commissioner for England,  said it was \"madness\" that the law currently allowed parents to take a child out of school when concerns had already been raised.",
      "The government has set out plans to introduce a requirement for families subject to a protection plan to get council permission before removing a child from school to be home-educated.",
      "Earlier this year it also announced plans to introduce a national register in England to help account for all home-educated children. This could come into force in 2025.",
      "Where next for Iran now that its 'Axis of Resistance' is shattered",
      "How Jaguar lost its way - long before that polarising advert",
      "No more Mr Nice Guy for Keir Starmer",
      "Dame Rachel has welcomed the decision. \"If we get proper registers, and we have local authorities taking their role seriously to engage with these families, we may find we can get lots of them back to school, which is where they need to be\", she told the Education Committee in November.",
      "But Wendy Charles-Warner argues that it is \"deeply offensive\" to parents to suggest that every child is at risk unless the local authority knows where they are. \"Home education is a big ask of parents. In most cases it's a positive move for their child, because they're acting to protect their child.\"",
      "However she acknowledges: \"Parents should not be home educating in cases where they don't want to.\"",
      "Back in south London, Toby's home education is going well - his father says he is calmer and happier - but he is all too aware that the situation is different for him than for many other families. As he puts it, they have the financial stability to be able to devote this time to educating Toby as a family.",
      "\"My wife's a doctor, we've never been financially vulnerable,\" he says. \"I'm educated, and we're very, very lucky.\"",
      "Despite all of this, he says that it has been \"bloody hard\".",
      "\"All of our kids have spent time out of school, and we have been in crisis,\" he says. \"It's not always easy but we are figuring it out\".",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 01:17:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Better Man tells the story of Robbie Williams' life, with him portrayed by a CGI monkey.",
    "story": [
      "Robbie Williams is thoroughly enjoying his wander into the world of film, even if he is still learning the correct lingo.",
      "\"I was at this thing called the Governors' Ball the other night. That was amazing,\" the singer says.",
      "He is talking about the Governors' Awards, held in Los Angeles, where he joined other guests including Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie and Daniel Craig.",
      "\"I'm super excited because it's all brand new to me. I feel like an artist that's just been signed. I'm full of hope, full of excitement, bewildered by it all.\"",
      "The project that currently has him walking red carpets with the biggest names in Hollywood is his biopic Better Man.",
      "\"Kevin Costner sought me out,\" he giggles, adding with growing incredulity: \"He wanted to come and tell me about the movie.\"",
      "Better Man deals with Williams' life from childhood, through the Take That years, to about 2003, the year he broke records by playing three huge gigs at Knebworth (with the aim of annoying Oasis, who had only managed two).",
      "The twist in the tale, or tail, is that throughout the film, and with no explanation, he is portrayed on screen as a monkey.",
      "At least that is how everyone involved in the film refers to the animal. If Sir David Attenborough veered into film reviewing, he would be quick to point out, in hushed tones, that the creature singing Angels and Rock DJ is a chimpanzee, not a monkey - because it has no tail.",
      "To paraphrase the debut album of Williams' old boyband, Ape That and Party.",
      "Williams is speaking to me at London's Soho Hotel, a venue so popular with the movie industry that at the exact same time, Rupert Everett is presenting an award on one floor, while in the basement there is a screening of a documentary produced by Jennifer Lawrence.",
      "Williams is sitting next to Michael Gracey, the director of 2017 hit The Greatest Showman.",
      "Now, after a gap of seven years, Better Man is Gracey's next film, and it was his idea to turn the main man into a monkey.",
      "For a year and half, Williams and Gracey had been sending messages back and forth, discussing a possible film musical based on his life.",
      "\"There have been a lot of musical biopics,\" says Gracey. \"I wanted to come at this with a different lens.",
      "\"Quite often Rob will say, 'I'm just like a performing monkey' or 'I'm up the back like a performing monkey'.",
      "\"It just sparked this idea of, we've got this chance to tell this story, not from the perspective of how we see Rob, but how he sees himself.",
      "\"And so I pitched the idea to Rob. I said, 'You know, if you were to be an animal, how would you see yourself?'\"",
      "Williams takes up the story: \"I was looking for some self-worth at the time and I was like, 'I am a lion'. And he just cocked his head and went, 'Mmmm.'",
      "\"I went, 'Monkey?'",
      "\"And he went, 'Yeah, so here's the idea.' And before the end of the sentence was out of his mouth, I'm like, 'Yes, that, that, that, please'.\"",
      "The monkey was created by Weta, the special effects company responsible for Gollum in Lord of the Rings and Caesar in Planet of the Apes. They used a combination of motion capture and CGI, with the role and the speaking voice taken on by English actor Jonno Davies, best known as Tobias in the Al Pacino TV series Hunters.",
      "But it turns out that the original plan was for Williams himself to play the monkey.",
      "\"I was going to, but it involved me leaving my family for loads and loads of months,\" he says. \"And the thought of that was just too much for me to bear.",
      "\"There are loads of things that I want to do that are just best being an idea. It was great at dinner parties, 'I'm playing me in a story about me.'",
      "\"And by the time it came round to it, I was bored of the idea. 'I've said it at dinner parties now. I've done it.'\"",
      "Me and My Monkey",
      "Williams did perform the whole of My Way while wired up to help with the motion capture, at a specially arranged pair of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in 2022.",
      "\"We also scanned his eyes,\" explains Gracey, \"So when you look at the monkey's eyes, it's actually one for one Rob's eyes.\"",
      "\"I kind of don't want to know which bit's me and which bit's not me,\" interrupts Williams.",
      "\"I want the magic of the film just to be the magic of the film.",
      "\"Also, Jonno, who plays me, has got a wonderful bottom and I want to believe that bit is me, that my bum will be memorialised as that epic.\"",
      "Robbie Williams sums up Better Man as \"the greatest hits of my trauma for the TikTok generation\".",
      "And the film doesn't shy away from dealing with his drug addictions and mental health problems, or when Nicole Appleton from All Saints was pregnant with their child and was pressured by people in the music industry, she said, into having an abortion.",
      "\"My part in her life I still have shame about. It's the most difficult part of the film for me to watch,\" Williams admits.",
      "\"She did me no harm and is a kind, lovely person. I was an idiot younger boyfriend.\"",
      "Chimp off the old block",
      "Appleton is supportive of the film and was consulted throughout production - unlike Williams' father Peter Conway, a singer with whom he has performed many times over the years.",
      "In Better Man, he is played by Inside No 9's Steve Pemberton and portrayed as someone who let down his family.",
      "\"He hasn't seen it yet. And I don't know if I want him to,\" says Williams.",
      "\"I haven't spoken to him about it. I'm embarrassed. I love my dad. Best mate, charming, wonderful man.",
      "\"But as it is with everybody's childhood, like the Philip Larkin poem, 'They mess you up your mum and dad.' And I'm messing my kids up.\"",
      "The film also paints a pretty poisonous portrait of Williams' time in Take That.",
      "\"There's a pattern - boys join a boyband, boyband becomes huge, boys get sick. And I don't think anybody gets to escape that,\" is his summary.",
      "\"I don't know what it is completely about fame that warps. I just know that it does. I know that young fame, in particular, is corrosive and toxic. It should come with a health warning.\"",
      "The death earlier this year of One Direction's Liam Payne, who he mentored on The X Factor in 2010, has made him want to change the way boybands are looked after.",
      "\"It's going to take a bunch of creatives to sit around, and I want to head that. I want to do that,\" he says.",
      "\"It has to be creative people, not members of Parliament or record company bosses. I think this needs to be oversensitive people with complicated inner lives, who understand what it's like to have a complicated inner life and what help that would need.\"",
      "But these plans will have to wait.",
      "At the moment, Williams' full attention is on the film and the Oscars.",
      "Success in the US is quite a change for a singer who famously never broke America. (Angels reached 53 in the Billboard chart, Millennium 72 and that was it.)",
      "In 2002, he even made fun of the situation with the self-deprecating I Will Talk And Hollywood Will Listen, in which the title rhymed with the lyric \"Mr Spielberg look just what you're missing\".",
      "How things change. Better Man has already earned a Golden Globe nomination for best song. And on Tuesday, he will find out whether Forbidden Road, which plays over the end credits, is among the 15 songs on the shortlist for the Academy Awards.",
      "And there are other categories in which the film could get a nomination.",
      "\"Best visual effects,\" starts Gracey, before Williams interjects once more.",
      "\"Best musical monkey!\" he beams.",
      "Gracey laughs. \"If that was a category, we would definitely win.\"",

      "He and his co-accused, Alex Blake-Walker, were both found not guilty on three joint counts of rape following a trial at Oxford Crown Court.",

    "story": [
      "This year's Christmas number one single will be unwrapped on Friday, with a mixture of old favourites, new efforts and wild cards all in the running.",
      "Last year, Wham! classic Last Christmas topped the yuletide singles chart, remarkably for the first time since its release in 1984, when the original Band Aid kept it off the number one spot.",
      "As is tradition, the festive number one will be announced on BBC Radio 1's chart show from 16:00 GMT on the Friday before Christmas.",
      "At the time of writing, a stocking full of artists - naughty and nice - are hoping to top the list.",
      "Wham!'s hit is the frontrunner after reclaiming the top spot in the last chart before the Christmas one, as people streamed it to get into the festive spirit. It has also been reissued on CD and 12-inch vinyl for its 40th anniversary for the final week of the chart race, giving it a further boost.",
      "Another seasonal staple, Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas, is not far behind.",
      "Also in this year's mix are Brenda Lee's golden oldie Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree and the latest incarnation of Band Aid.",
      "They're joined by a new festive tune by Tom Grennan, while songs by Ariana Grande and Kelly Clarkson have established themselves as returning Christmas classics.",
      "Or the chart crown could go to something non-Christmassy - like recent hits by Gracie Abrams, Rose and Bruno Mars, or the fast-rising Lola Young.",
      "There was a long period when the Christmas number one was reserved for the latest X Factor winner - seven times between 2005-14 - or novelty charity-fundraising sausage-roll enthusiast LadBaby, a five-time victor between 2018-22.",
      "And just like with buying gifts, the key for any artists involved now, according to Official Chart Company boss Martin Talbot, is to step into Christmas with confidence and a strategy, and to go early.",
      "\"The singles market is very much dominated by streaming these days, in general terms, throughout the year,\" he says.",
      "\"But the Christmas market is the one market where you can sell a lot of physical [copies and] a lot of downloads and actually make a big difference. Because people want to buy gifts.",
      "\"That's where Wham! will do really well this year.\"",
      "Physical or download sales count for much more than streams in the chart in the digital era.",
      "\"The other thing is, if you've got a charity record, let's not be shy about it,\" Talbot notes.",
      "That's an adage not lost on Bob Geldof and the Band Aid team, who are going again with their own 40th anniversary Ultimate Mix, which has made headlines this time after Ed Sheeran said he would have preferred for his vocals not to have been used again because of the song's portrayal of Africa.",
      "\"When people engage with charity records, they're not doing it because they specifically want to listen to the charity record over and over again, Talbot notes.",
      "\"Streaming doesn't really work.\" Instead, he says: \"It's all about voting. And you cast your vote by buying a download or by buying physical products.\"",
      "East 17, Reverend and the Makers and The Celebs are all also having a go in aid of various charities this year, as are South Yorkshire Fire & Rescue.",
      "Mariah's slow-burning 1994 anthem finally topped the UK chart for the first time in 2020, returning to the summit in 2022.",

      "\"I guess I turned it into, if there's something that you love, it means more than all that stuff.\" Aww.",
      "Her tune, like Wham!'s and Band Aid's, has benefitted from being heavily promoted by streaming services like Spotify, Apple and Amazon on their top Christmas playlists.",
      "In recent years, Amazon has thrown its might behind new Christmas songs that are exclusive to its service. They have included Sam Ryder's You're Christmas To Me, which narrowly lost out to Wham! last year, and Ellie Goulding's River, which topped the chart just after Christmas in 2019.",
      "This year, Grennan's soulful, lovelorn It Can't Be Christmas is only available via Amazon Music.",
      "Grennan, who actually penned the track in Los Angeles in the summer, said it was a \"no-brainer\" for him to team up with the streamer to create his own festive song.",
      "Amazon has also commissioned Icelandic-Chinese singer-songwriter Laufey's Christmas Magic.",

      "Chart expert James Masterson says the Christmas number one race began as an invention of British bookmakers in 1984.",
      "While it used to produce many bona fide pop hits, he believes the concept has been \"ruined\" in recent years, not least by the admittedly well-intentioned LadBaby.",
      "\"It became pointless speculating as to what was going to be Christmas number one,\" he says of the LadBaby era.",
      "\"Which is why, when he didn't release a song last year, it left this void and it was a void that nobody came along to fill.\"",
      "Last Christmas \"won by default\", he says, because it appears at the top of all the Christmas playlists playing \"the same old songs, every single year, in much the same order\".",
      "'Disaster for the concept'",
      "Due to a crowded Christmas market, Masterson says many record labels began to feel it's not worth worrying about the end of year chart any more.",
      "Chart rules dictate that songs released in the last three years are weighted more favourably than those already in the Christmas canon.",
      "But even with that factor in their favour, he feels it is increasingly difficult for artists with genuinely good new seasonal songs to \"achieve enough momentum\" to \"get lucky\".",
      "\"My view is that if Last Christmas by Wham! gets the Christmas number one again by default, it would be a disaster for the whole concept,\" he concludes.",

      "The charity's announced it's teaming up with streaming giant Spotify to fund 15 youth clubs over the next year to provide more opportunities and support to pursue music.",
      "\"We have a real opportunity not just to fund but to story tell,\" says Spotify's global head of social impact, Lauren Wurgraft.",
      "Spotify has drawn criticism from artists over how much they get paid by the platform, and Youth Music says it had to consider that carefully when agreeing to the deal.",
      "But it's been welcomed by south London rapper Still Shadey who tells Newsbeat music was a \"saving grace\" and a spark \"for something positive\" when he was growing up.",
      "The MOBO award winner launched his own scheme to support young people in his area over the summer with funding from Arts Council England, Mirror Mirror.",
      "\"We have huge brands taking a step that will hopefully create a catalyst where other organisations can do the same,\" he says.",
      "Spotify would not tell Newsbeat how much it's spending on the project with Youth Music but Matt says it's \"over six figures\".",
      "The money will be used to protect youth clubs across the UK that are at risk of closure in a bid to get more young people into music.",
      "It follows Youth Music's Sound of the Next Generation report, a survey the charity does every five years, with its latest one asking 2,100 young people about their lives and attitudes towards music.",
      "\"Top of the tree as their favourite thing in their lives is music,\" says Matt.",
      "\"But there was also a contrasting [finding] about access to music getting more limited, particularly access to making music and creating and composing your own music.\"",
      "Girls and people from the North of England are particularly affected according to the report which highlights the cost of music education as a major block.",
      "Meanwhile, research from the YMCA suggests that since 2011, about half of England's youth clubs have closed - rising to 60% in Wales.",
      "The Local Government Association adds that, in that same time, government funding for youth clubs has declined by 73% in real terms.",
      "Shadey says it was \"the last phase of youth clubs\" when he was growing up, describing the centres as little more than a warm space.",
      "\"We felt this was ending, things were closing down, derelict buildings, old PlayStation games, nothing being updated.",
      "\"That's not enough to keep a young person engaged. They want to learn and grow and be a part of something.\"",
      "Lauren agrees that access is a \"huge barrier\".",
      "\"You can dream about being an artist but if you don't actually have a place where you can go and create and learn, then that really is never going to become a reality.\"",
      "The 15 youth hubs which will be receiving the money haven't yet been decided - although according to Matt the funding could be allocated as soon as Christmas.",
      "Youth Music says it will be targeting programmes and centres across the UK it already works with.",
      "\"It's very important these aren't just based in major cities because we know these spaces are important to youth all over the place,\" says Lauren.",
      "For Shadey, he hopes projects like this will help with what he sees as the biggest problem facing young people: feeling \"disconnected\" from the areas where they live.",
      "\"Feeling like they don't belong,\" he says.",
      "Spotify and monetising music",
      "Youth Music's stated mission isn't just to help marginalised young people make music, it's also to help them monetise it.",
      "And Spotify has a reputation - it says an unfair one - for not being very profitable for artists.",
      "The platform pays royalties to copyright holders and while sometimes that's the artist, it often means publishers and labels.",
      "Last year, 1,000 British artists were streamed enough to be paid at least \u00a3100,000 but on average they would only pocket 16% of what they earn from the app, all while Spotify reports record breaking billion dollar profits.",
      "Spotify says rights holders take around 70% of revenue, and UK recording artists made \u00a3750 million in royalties from streaming last year, with the streamer having no say in how the money's split - that's an agreement between the artists and their management.",
      "Copyright holders are also not paid at all if their song is streamed fewer than 1,000 times in a year.",
      "Matt says squaring that with Youth Music's ethos of helping artists monetise their work was something the charity had to \"think about\".",
      "\"The debate about how artists, particularly emerging artists, make a living is very, very live,\" he says.",
      "\"You make a judgement call that in the end, this is going to make a difference for young people and their lives in music at this urgent time.\"",
      "Lauren acknowledges this scheme is more targeted at opening that initial door for artists of the future than sustaining a career in the industry.",
      "\"To basically provide opportunities for them to learn and grow and connect and be nurtured so they can actually even imagine becoming an artist and making a livelihood off it,\" she says.",
      "Spotify isn't the only private company that's announced schemes aimed at filling the gap in youth services this year.",
      "Working with BBC Children in Need and fronted by rapper AJ Tracey, McDonald's launched its Makin' It project, partnering restaurants with youth workers so they can host workshops and drop-in sessions.",
      "And in south London, Stormzy set up a youth club in partnership with Adidas earlier this year, something Lauren says inspired Spotify.",
      "\"It's great these bigger companies are coming in and investing in those communities as part of their corporate social responsibility,\" says Shadey.",
      "\"But the depth is only gonna be seen if they partner with community leaders and grassroots organisations so it's authentic.\"",
      "Stormzy's Merky FC is a state-of-the-art facility with a full-size football pitch, recording studio and gaming centre and the rapper told the BBC he'd be a regular visitor, providing songwriting masterclasses and gaming.",
      "Spotify on the other hand will be taking a more hands-off approach and won't be involved in the Youth Music scheme beyond the funding they've pledged.",
      "But Shadey thinks the power of brand alone will draw people in.",
      "His Mirror Mirror project supported 60 young people - all of whom had to apply - and provided trips to 1Xtra and Abbey Road studios and the Houses of Parliament to give them a taste of the music industry.",
      "\"I think youth clubs today need to create that same model where people know it's a privilege, they know it's an opportunity.\"",
      "While this project has some government support, Matt says the charity would prefer not to rely so much on private investment.",
      "\"Short term funding, it's great at the time but you're always planning for the next days without getting that longer term certainty,\" he says.",
      "\"Government support is vital... It's always a combination, but you do have to see the government really shouting loudly, not just about music, but about young people.\"",

      "Mr Hamaguchi most recently accepted a Game Award for best score and music at the industry's biggest ceremony in Los Angeles.",
      "Newsbeat speaks to him at the Golden Joysticks in London, where Rebirth scoops prizes for Best Soundtrack, Best Storytelling and performance.",
      "The initial announcement of developer Square Enix's intention to split the project into three was met with some scepticism - the original game could be completed in about 40 hours.",
      "So does Mr Hamaguchi think he's proved the doubters wrong?",
      "\"I hope we've convinced them,\" he says.",
      "\"With the original being so famous, so many people have their own visions of what Final Fantasy VII is. It\u2019s very difficult to please absolutely every single fan out there.\"",
      "Despite his own concerns about the remakes taking up so much of his professional life, he says he's happy he took the plunge.",
      "\"Final Fantasy was one of the big inspirations for me to want to become a game creator in the first place,\" he says.",
      "\"This was my way of giving back to the series.\"",

      "\"I want to move away from it and take on a completely new kind of challenge\", he says.",
      "\"I've given everything I have to this.\"",
      "Mr Hamaguchi says the game development climate when the first game was released means the approach to making the new games is fundamentally different.",
      "Because it takes years to make a blockbuster game for modern machines, he says teams need to think about how the landscape will look in five to ten years' time.",
      "For example, emerging markets such as the Middle East and South East Asia \"are undergoing very rapid economic growth\" and creating a new generation of gamers.",
      "\"It's really interesting to see so many young people getting into gaming in these regions,\" he says.",
      "In contrast to making a game 20 years ago, developers need to make sure cultural references work across regions where video games are more popular than they once were.",
      "The games market is tougher, too.",
      "Square Enix has said Rebirth - which released exclusively on PlayStation 5 - did not perform as well as it had hoped, and it recently confirmed a PC version would be coming soon.",
      "People play on more platforms and there's evidence that many gamers are sticking with a \"home game\" such as Fortnite, Roblox or Call of Duty for longer periods.",
      "Drawing them away is hard, but Mr Hamaguchi says the buzz from an awards nomination can give a game a boost.",
      "\"Previously we'd release a game on a console and it would sell very well for the first couple of weeks,\" he says.",

      "Final Fantasy VII's history stretches back more than 20 years, but does Mr Hamaguchi have any thoughts on where gaming might be in the same amount of time in the future?",
      "\"Something along the lines of virtual reality, or perhaps more like augmented reality, where you can create a digital environment which merges with the real world and people can interact with things in that world,\" he says.",
      "\"I think that\u2019s a very different feeling to what we have when we play games with a standard controller today\".",

      "\"No-one knew about it,\" he says.",
      "Fans can breathe a sigh of relief, though.",
      "Khan didn't quit for long. And now he's back and is promoting Laapataa Ladies - or Lost Ladies - a film he's produced. It is India's official pick for the Oscars in the best international feature film category.",

      "He is also no stranger to the Oscars. Lagaan, a film about cricket set in the 19th Century during the British Empire, was nominated for best foreign language film in 2002.",
      "Khan is now trying to make history with Laapataa Ladies. If it succeeds, it would be the first Indian film to win the coveted international prize. He will find out whether it has made the shortlist on Tuesday.",
      "Khan said he's \"not quite sure how seriously\" to take awards. \"Cinema is so subjective,\" he says.",
      "But he admits a win would mean a lot to India.",
      "\"I think Indians are so film crazy and we've been dying to win the Academy Award for an Indian film, which hasn't happened till now. So the country will go ballistic. They'll just go mad if we win,\" he says.",

      "Khan describes the plot as \"a bit Shakespearean\", with its focus on humour and mistaken identities.",
      "But, he adds, it's saying \"a lot of important things about women's issues, their independence, their right to decide for themselves what they want to do\".",
      "It was these issues that drew him to the film in the first place, he explains.",
      "\"Every now and then you get an opportunity as a creative person to actually also sensitise people about certain issues that we face in society,\" he says.",
      "\"Women all over the world have been subjected to a lot of challenges in their lives. Women have a raw deal in life. So I felt that here is a story which really brings that out well in such a nice way, which is why I wanted to produce it.\"",

      "The pair, who married in 2005, announced their separation in 2021. But they have remained close, both professionally and personally.",
      "\"I think the reason I chose Kiran was because I knew that she would be very honest with it and that's what I wanted,\" he says.",

      "\"We can't make a film without an argument. So we argue every point and we have strong opinions,\" he says.",

      "\"India has made really great films over the years. Occasionally it's a matter of the right film not getting sent or the best film not getting sent,\" he says.",
      "\"But otherwise we have to understand that the films you're competing against - you're not competing against five or six films, you're competing against almost 80 or 90 films, which are the best in the world.\"",
      "As to whether a Bollywood film could one day scoop the best overall film award, Khan says it is \"possible\".",
      "But Indian film-makers would first need to start making movies for a global market, he adds.",
      "\"I've never really looked at an international audience,\" he says. \"We have such a large audience of our own that it doesn't come in to our mind.",
      "\"That will only happen when Indians start making films for a world audience. I don't think we have the bandwidth for it right now.\"",
      "'I don't work after 6 o'clock'",
      "For now, Khan is focusing on a range of projects alongside Laapataa Ladies, which also include his next film Sitaare Zameen Par, due for release in 2025.",
      "Looking further out, he's hoping to make one film a year, while his \"dream project\" is to take on Mahabharat - the ancient Indian epic.",

      "Khan says he has also started therapy in recent years, inspired by his daughter Ira, who works in mental health.",

    "story": [
      "Zakir Hussain, the legendary tabla virtuoso and global ambassador of Indian classical music who has died aged 73, leaves behind a timeless rhythmic legacy that will inspire generations.",
      "A child prodigy, he collaborated with Indian classical icons like Ravi Shankar, Ali Akbar Khan, and Shivkumar Sharma and global musicians like John McLaughlin and George Harrison.",
      "Born on 9 March, 1951, in Mahim, Mumbai, he was the eldest son of Ustad Allarakha, one of history's most iconic players of the tabla - a pair of traditional Indian hand played drums.",
      "Hussain's journey, from a child prodigy to an internationally celebrated percussionist, was a masterclass in balancing tradition and innovation.",
      "Hussain's life revolved around rhythm from the very beginning.",
      "The sound of the tabla was his first language, his earliest \"words\". By the age of 12, he was already performing globally, accompanying stalwarts like Pandit Ravi Shankar and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan during his teenage years.",
      "While rooted in the Hindustani classical tradition, Hussain possessed an insatiable curiosity that propelled him to explore other genres, leading to ground-breaking collaborations across the world.",
      "In 1973, he co-founded Shakti with guitarist John McLaughlin, a group that fused Indian classical music with jazz and Western traditions, creating a new global sound.",
      "Over five decades, Shakti evolved, featuring luminaries like violinist L Shankar, percussionist Vikku Vinayakram, and mandolin maestro U Srinivas.",
      "Their first studio album in 46 years, This Moment, won the Grammy for Best Global Music Album in 2024, marking a fitting finale to their 50th-anniversary tour. Hussain's virtuosity on the tabla was pivotal to Shakti's success and to the global appreciation of Indian rhythms.",
      "Zakir Hussain's contributions extended far beyond Shakti.",
      "He was a key collaborator in Planet Drum and Global Drum Project, both with Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, earning him Grammy Awards in 1991 and 2008.",
      "He worked with banjo maestro B\u00e9la Fleck and bassist Edgar Meyer on the Grammy-winning As We Speak (2024), further cementing his status as a pioneer of cross-genre collaborations. He also collaborated with musicians as diverse as Yo-Yo Ma, George Harrison, Van Morrison and Billy Cobham, bringing Indian classical music to global audiences.",
      "His ventures like Tabla Beat Science, a fusion of Indian classical music with electronic and world music, and orchestral works such as Peshkar for the Symphony Orchestra of India showcased his unrelenting drive to innovate while respecting his roots.",
      "\"The moment you think you're a maestro, you are distancing yourself from the others,\" Hussain told Rolling Stone India magazine earlier this year. \"You have to be part of a group, and not dominate it.\"",
      "This philosophy made him not only a consummate artist but also a lifelong learner and mentor.",
      "Hussain's flamboyance and speed and precision of his performances earned him widespread admiration.",
      "The New York Times, in its review of a 2009 jazz performance at Carnegie Hall, described his artistry as embodying \"an impish strain of virtuosity\".",
      "\"He's a fearsome technician but also a whimsical inventor, devoted to exuberant play. So he rarely seems overbearing, even when the blur of his fingers rivals the beat of a hummingbird's wings.\"",
      "His accolades are as numerous as the beats he crafted.",
      "A recipient of the Padma Bhushan and Padma Shri, Hussain was also a National Endowment for the Arts National Heritage Fellow in the United States. He delighted audiences at prestigious venues like Carnegie Hall and collaborated with jazz legends, Western classical orchestras, and Carnatic music maestros.",
      "Despite his global acclaim, Hussain remained deeply connected to his Indian roots. His early years in a modest chawl - large tenement complexes - in Mahim shaped his values.",
      "\"For the first three-and-a-half years of my life, we all lived in one room that had no toilet. We had to use the common toilets,\" Hussain told Nasreen Munni Kabir.",
      "Offstage, Hussain was an avid reader and a fan of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. He loved poetry, cricket, and tennis, counting Roger Federer among his heroes. His curiosity extended to biographies of musical greats like Ravi Shankar and Miles Davis, reflecting his hunger for stories that transcended boundaries. Hussain would also later say that his TV advert for a popular tea brand - Taj Mahal - \"made me famous in India\".",
      "Hussain's death marks the end of an era but leaves an indelible mark on global music. Kabir, who chronicled his life, aptly captured his essence: \"Zakir's extraordinary playing and the extreme sense of rigour he brought to his art made him a phenomenon.\"",
      "Music for Hussain was not just a career but a spiritual journey - a way to connect with people, traditions, and cultures across the globe.",
      "In his final years, Hussain remained as active as ever, performing, mentoring, and composing.",
      "\"Being a student and having a drive to learn keeps me going. The opportunity to get inspired by all the young musicians out there helps me revamp myself. Age doesn't affect my energy and drive,\" he said last year."

      "Then... silence.",

      "\"We can't just release any old piece of music,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"We take it very seriously and, especially for our first album, we want to represent ourselves in the best way with the best message.\"",
      "In the end, that meant scrapping a huge number of completed tracks half-way through the recording sessions.",
      "They did so on the advice of LVRN (Love Renaissance), the US management company who helped launch the careers of Summer Walker and 6lack.",
      "\"They came on board during the recording process and they were like, 'Come on, guys, this ain't gonna cut it',\" recalls Downer.",
      "\"It was hard to hear because you become biased [towards the songs you have] but they really opened our eyes to the fact that we could do better.",
      "\"We're very open to criticism, even if we felt a little emotional at the time.",
      "\"But then we quickly realised that, OK, this is for the good.\"",
      "Reinvigorated, they doubled their efforts, criss-crossing the Atlantic to work with new writers and producers while \"filling in the blanks\" in their lyrical themes and \"honing their sound\".",
      "\"It was a long process because it was very detailed,\" explains Downer.",
      "The wait was worth it.",
      "Released last month, Flo's debut album Access All Areas quickly picked up rave reviews.",
      "\"If a girl group's main job is to supply harmonies for days and kick out songs that roll around your head like marble, Access All Areas achieves it all,\" said Pitchfork, awarding the album 8 out of 10.",
      "DIY called it \"a definitive debut\" while Rolling Stone asked \"Are Flo the next great girl group?\"",
      "In the UK, the album entered the charts at number three \u2013 making Flo the highest-charting British R&B girl group in 23 years (matching the chart position of Mis-Teeq's debut album Lickin' On Both Sides).",
      "\"We're grateful everyone's enjoying it,\" says Douglas. \"It feels like our artistry is a bit more real, like we've got a bit more credit to our names and we're moving in the right direction.\"",
      "From a certain perspective, their success seems pre-ordained.",
      "Since the demise of Little Mix, there's been a girl band-shaped hole in the pop charts. And, because pop always travels in 20-year cycles, there's a renewed interest in the harmony-driven hits of the 2000s.",
      "Flo know those songs back-to-front. Although Quaresma \"wasn't even born\" when Mis-Teeq made the top three, the girls were all raised on the music of Brandy, Faith Evans and Mariah Carey.",
      "That education came at home. All three are only children, and all three were raised by music-loving single mums.",
      "The shared background helped them forge a unique bond \u2013 first at stage school, where Renee and Stella met, then during auditions for Flo, where they hooked up with Jorja.",
      "\"Being in a girl group is one thing, but finding each other has given it a totally different meaning,\" says Jorja.",
      "\"I wouldn't feel the same if I was with two other girls that kind of came from a different background.",
      "\"It's like we're one person that's got some kind of personality disorder!\"",
      "'Hardest music to sell'",
      "That strength helped them hold firm when, in the early days, managers tried to change the band's line-up; and it made them fight for Cardboard Box to be their debut single, against record label advice.",
      "Studying R&B taught them more than how to harmonise \u2013 it showed them how the music industry, particularly in the UK, can be stacked against black women.",
      "Time after time, promising artists like Jamelia, Sadie Ama and even Raye have been let down by labels that don't know how to promote R&B to a UK audience. Others, like Mahalia and Ella Mai, have focused on breaking the US, where the genre has deeper roots.",
      "\"That's the music I love the most, and it's probably the hardest music to sell in this country,\" Radio 2's Trevor Nelson told The Guardian last year. \"It just is. It's always been.\"",

      "\"How many black girls do you see on centre stage now? / Yet you wonder why they going to the States now.\"",
      "\"I actually think we've been pretty lucky, but we've definitely seen little comments here and there, or people not being accustomed to the music that we make,\" says Douglas.",
      "\"When we go out in the UK, people love R&B, but I think people who make the decisions in the industry in the UK aren't so familiar with it. So I think it can make people feel a little bit unappreciated.",
      "\"I think what sets us apart is that we speak about it,\" says Downer. \"We're all thinking it, all the R&B artists in the UK. We're not content with making music and it reaching fewer people.",
      "\"We're very happy that we're starting to be seen as the catalyst for change,\" adds Quaresma, \"but it's obviously a problem\".",
      "For now, the trio are playing the game. The first single from Access All Areas was the irresistibly catchy Walk Like This, a pop hit in R&B clothing. Then they targeted urban radio with the slinky, serpentine grooves of Caught Up.",
      "\"We're constantly doing  a push and pull between 'this is a bit more pop-leaning, and this is more R&B',\" says Downer.",
      "\"We have to be open to putting our pop foot first sometimes, because of the world that we live in. But a few years down the line, it's gonna be different.\"",
      "R&B aficionados have already locked on to the band's deliciously seductive grooves.",
      "Wicked star Cynthia Erivo voices the introduction to their album, while the deluxe edition features guest appearances from Chl\u00f6e and Halle, GloRilla and Bree Runway.",
      "Last year, they were VIP guests on Beyonc\u00e9's Renaissance tour (\"Right next to her dad. It was a bit nerve-wracking, to be honest\") and they spent autumn on the road with US soul star Kehlani.",

      "Which reminds me: The last time we spoke to Flo was in 2022, and they'd just been given treadmills, so they could build up the stamina to sing and run at the same time. How did that work out?",
      "\"It didn't last that long,\" admits Quaresma. \"Mine got sold.\"",
      "The lack of stamina came back to bite them on their US tour - not on stage, but at an afterparty.",
      "\"We were in New Orleans and Kehlani insisted we try out a mechanical bull,\" says Downer.",
      "\"We were all very bad,\" laughs Quaresma. \"It's much harder than it looks.\"",
      "\"I thought I had the core strength but, really, I did not,\" says Douglas.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Dec 2024 00:03:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The Colombian singer is the world's most-watched artist when it comes to streamed videos.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G?",
      "While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online.",
      "That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024.",
      "This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion.",
      "So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernab\u00e9u Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year?",
      "Born in the Colombian city of Medell\u00edn in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005.",
      "Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it.",
      "While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked.",
      "She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed.",
      "Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart.",
      "Karol G's style of music is more often described as \"reggaeton\". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish.",
      "While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Roc\u00edo Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer \u2013 and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos.",
      "\"Streaming democratised the landscape,\" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world.",
      "\"Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution.\"",
      "Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%.",
      "Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (\u00a31.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this.",
      "And this year, Karol's G's Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify.",
      "This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Ma\u00f1ana Ser\u00e1 Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist.",
      "Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event.",
      "\"There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,\" he adds.",
      "Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Espa\u00f1ol at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map.",
      "\"I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,\" she says. \"And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top.",
      "\"And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,\" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music.",
      "Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs \"Bichota\". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality.",
      "She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them.",
      "Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour.",
      "Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify.",
      "Ms Cobo says: \"She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music.\"",
      "Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation.",
      "This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates.",
      "Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group.",
      "Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora.",
      "However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. \"It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,\" she says.",

    "story": [
      "Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet has been praised by critics for his portrayal of Bob Dylan, in a new film biopic of the US singer-songwriter.",
      "A Complete Unknown has already scored three Golden Globe nominations and is likely to be in the Oscars race in the new year.",
      "The Guardian said Chalamet showed \"amazing bravado\" in his performance, while Empire said the actor is \"superb\" and his \"musical talent is unimpeachable\".",
      "But the Independent said the biopic itself \"plays too safe\" and Screen Rant described the \"serviceable\" film as a \"fascinating yet frustrating\" portrait.",
      "A Complete Unknown is released on Christmas Day in the US, and 17 January in the UK.",
      "Dylan himself has endorsed the film, although he had not actually seen it at the time he posted about it last week on X.",
      "\"Timmy's a brilliant actor so I'm sure he's going to be completely believable as me. Or a younger me. Or some other me,\" Dylan said.",
      "In her three-star review, the Independent's Clarisse Loughrey said the film \"takes a reverent stance to Dylan's artistry, populated by technically accomplished musical performances\".",
      "She said Chalamet's voice \"isn't perfect, but it's undoubtedly impressive\", adding the film is \"shot with a real sensitivity to the emotional landscape of each track\".",
      "The film is based on Elijah Wald's 2015 book, Dylan Goes Electric!",
      "Set in the early 1960s, it tells the story of Dylan's rise to fame, and the conflict between his folk roots and his desire to expand his repertoire to include rock 'n' roll.",
      "The friction is represented by the choice between his use of an acoustic and electric guitar, and Dylan's lyrics gradually become bolder and more reflective of the world he sees around him.",
      "The film climaxes with a famously chaotic performance at at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965, where Dylan was booed by some members of the audience for playing an electric set with an amplified band.",
      "Deadline's Pete Hammond praised the film's production design, costumes and cinematography, as well as its lead performance.",
      "\"At the centre of this all is a remarkable performance by Chalamet, who performs all the songs himself in astonishing and authentic fashion. There is no lip-syncing or blending of voices between actor and subject,\" he noted.",
      "\"The music of course is worth the price of admission, but in Mangold's hands fortunately there is so much more to add, thus making Bob Dylan a little less than complete unknown by the time the credits roll.\"",
      "The film also follows Dylan's romantic relationships with two women in particular - civil rights activist Sylvie Russo (played by Elle Fanning) and folk musician Joan Baez (Monica Barbaro).",
      "Screen Rant's Mae Abdulbaki reflected: \"I could understand both women more clearly than Chalamet's Dylan. Behind his sunglasses and tight body language, Dylan remains elusive.",
      "\"The film is very much about an artist who doesn't explain himself, and I have immense respect for that, but it also creates an emotional disconnect in narrative form. It was as though I was watching a series of events that I couldn't bring myself to care about. That's what Mangold risks by keeping Dylan out of reach.\"",
      "There was a rave review from the Guardian's Peter Bradshaw, who awarded the film five stars and praised Chalamet's \"hilarious and seductive portrayal\".",
      "\"Interestingly the story, despite the classic music-biopic tropes that Mangold did so much to popularise, does not conform to the classic rise-fall-learning-experience-comeback format,\" he said. It's all rise, but troubled and unclear.\"",
      "The Times Kevin Maher was far less enthusiastic, awarding just two stars",
      "\"There will be audiences who will regard the recreation of Newport '65 as a monumental cinematic event. But for many it will land with a giant shrug of indifference,\" he noted.",
      "\"[Chalamet's] performance is an unhelpful study in blank-eyed lockjaw minimalism, while his singing voice is fine if, occasionally, close to parody (but all Dylan imitators sound like parody).\"",
      "With an acclaimed back catalogue built up over seven decades, Dylan is best known for hits such as Blowin in the Wind, Mr. Tambourine Man, It Ain't Me Babe, Girl From The North Country and The Times They Are a Changin'.",
      "\"Perhaps Dylan himself is too mercurial a figure for a biopic to ever capture him completely,\" wrote the Telegraph's Robbie Collin in a four-star review. \"A Complete Unknown comes about as close as one could reasonably hope.",
      "\"For the most part, the film plays like a juicy rise-to-power drama rather than a scenic tour of an artist's Wikipedia page.\"",
      "Elsewhere, the Evening Standard's Nick Curtis joked the film made him \"really, really want to learn to play harmonica\".",
      "\"It's a defiantly unlikeable performance, miles away from Chalamet's romantic leads,\" Curtis noted.",
      "\"He captures Dylan's craning stance and the way he used hair and sunglasses as a mask, the insistent buzz and keen of his speaking and singing voice and the odd, touchy, insularity.\"",
      "A Complete Unknown also stars Edward Norton and is directed by James Mangold, the filmmaker behind Johnny Cash biopic Walk The Line and films in the X-Men and Indiana Jones franchises.",
      "The Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney added: \"Commendably, neither the movie nor the actor sugarcoat the abrasiveness of a creative genius whose insensitivity toward people close to him often stands in stark contrast to the humanity in his songs.\"",
      "\"That detachment leaves something of a hole where the emotional centre should be in the screenplay by Mangold and Jay Cocks. Making a film about an enigmatic subject is inherently challenging and the writers deserve credit for declining to try to solve the mystery of Bob Dylan, even if that also risks making them seem incurious.\"",
      "Empire's John Nugent concluded: \"Frustratingly, for a story about a poetic genius, it struggles to find something fresh to say.",
      "\"There is some interesting stuff about the burden of talent... But by 1965 he is almost always behind sunglasses, his enigma calcified.",

      "She recommends cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) to enable the player to reframe dartitis as a challenge they need to overcome.",
      "Kevin has been trying to conquer the condition with hypnotherapy - and CBT - taking sessions with Chris O'Connor whose company Eccleston Park Hypnotherapy is the official \"hypnotherapy partner\" of the Professional Darts Players Association (PDPA).",

      "\"It's all about getting them to visualise an area of their life they want to improve.\"",
      "After eight sessions, it seemed Kevin's dartitis had been cured for good. But two weeks later, during a televised match at the World Senior Darts tour, the condition returned. \"I was really, really disappointed,\" he said. \"I thought it had gone.\"",
      "He's now back working with Mr O'Connor on cracking the disorder long term.",
      "The therapy Mr O'Connor offers is tailored for each person he treats, using a mixture of Solution Focused Brief Therapy, hypnosis and visualization techniques to eliminate dartitis, he said.",
      "Mr O'Connor said: \"It's results-based, with clients often noticing changes after just a few sessions.",
      "\"I work with four world champions across UFC, darts, and snooker, and seven elite PDC darts players in the world top 30. So far, I have helped over 50 clients eliminate dartitis in the last two years.\"",
      "Unlike Kevin, Jack has managed to shake his dartitis and with lasting results.",
      "In January, the 31-year-old decided to start throwing with his left hand.",
      "\"[It was] the biggest decision of my entire life playing darts,\" he said.",

      "Alongside his better performances, Jack found another benefit - he no longer needed to drink alcohol to play.",
      "\"I used to shake if I didn't have a beer I'd be so nervous,\" he said.",
      "\"If you'd have told me a year ago I'd play darts sober, I wouldn't have believed you.\"",
      "In another bid to aid his recovery, Kevin has also started to drink less.",
      "Despite there being no established link between drinking and dartitis, it's a sign of his determination to try everything to kick the condition.",
      "\"It's no secret everyone likes a drink when they play,\" he said.",
      "\"But you have to put the effort [into the treatment]. I like to go for a walk in the mornings to clear my head.\"",
      "\"Everyone's been very supportive,\" he said.",
      "\"I've spoken to so many people who have it or have had it. I wouldn't have had those conversations if I didn't get dartitis.\""

      "But the body representing district councils has warned the plans could spark \"turmoil\" and argued \"mega-councils\" could undermine local decision-making.",
      "In a speech announcing the plans, Rayner said devolution would be the \"default\" rather than \"at the whim of a minister in Whitehall\".",
      "She described the UK as the \"most centralised\" country in Europe and pledged to end \"micromanaging by central government\".",
      "Rayner said the government would work with local leaders to deliver its plans but where they are unable to agree on a way forward, ministers would get the power in law to \"knock heads together\" and create larger authorities.",

      "Some areas, particularly larger towns and some cities, have \"unitary\" authorities responsible for both - while the regions surrounding big cities are increasingly covered by multi-council \"combined\" authorities with greater powers in areas such as transport policy, planning and housing.",
      "The Conservatives created 11 such areas, which have an elected \"metro\" mayor, and set a target that every part of England that wanted greater powers in some form would get a devolution deal by 2030.",
      "Despite this, around half of England's population live in an area not covered by a devolution deal.",

      "Elected mayors would then oversee areas representing two\u00a0or more councils, and be handed more powers over things such as planning decisions and public transport.",
      "Dozens of district councils could be abolished as a result \u2013 prompting some to claim it would deprive people of genuinely localised decision-making.",
      "It would require a series of deals nationwide emulating North Yorkshire, which now has a unitary authority after eight councils were merged together last year.",
      "This would mark a scale of reorganisation that goes beyond what Labour promised in its election manifesto, and amount to arguably the biggest shake-up of local government since the 1970s.",
      "Labour argues the overhaul will make local government simpler and produce savings by making the delivery of services more efficient.",
      "The plans are opposed by the District Councils' Network, an umbrella group for such councils, which says there is \"little evidence\" from past reorganisations that taxpayers' money will be saved.",
      "Hannah Dalton, vice-chair of the network, said the \"creation of mega councils\" could prove \"the opposite of devolution\".",

      "Some places have both district and county councils that each provide some services; some places have one council that does everything, and some places have a mayor who oversees that.",
      "Rayner's plan is to make the system similar across England. So bins and libraries, planning and leisure centres will all fall under one, single council.",
      "The government says merging councils could save \u00a32bn. That comes amid a bleak picture of council finances across the country.",
      "Neighbouring areas would then be grouped together under what's called a strategic authority with a directly elected metro mayor. Recent examples of this include Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, who now fall under the East Midlands Combined County Authority, and elected their first mayor, Labour's Claire Ward, in May.",

      "\"We must rewire England and end the hoarding in Whitehall by devolving power and money from central government to those with skin in the game,\" Rayner said.",
      "Mayoral devolution deals also usually come with a 30-year investment fund of hundreds of millions of pounds. Some mayors also have powers to charge their own precept on council tax - although not all those that do have that power actually charge one.",
      "Areas that can demonstrate sound financial management will get so-called integrated settlements. That means they get one pot of money from Whitehall and can choose to allocate it how they see fit, rather than specific budgets for specific things.",
      "London-style transport networks across the country",
      "Local mayors are to be given powers over their area's transport under the plans.",
      "It could mean London-style networks, where buses and light commuter trains are all run as part of the same system.",
      "Some areas which already have mayors are doing this already. Greater Manchester has taken all bus services back under control as part of the Bee Network alongside its Meterolink tram, with plans to add commuter trains to the system by 2028.",

      "Research by the Centre for Cities suggests that transport has the most cut-through of all policies mayors had put in place.",

      "More roads, junctions and reservoirs?",
      "Mayors would be given responsibilities for strategic planning. That means they'd have to come up with plans for building housing and infrastructure.",
      "Housing is one of the government's top priorities, with a pledge to build 1.5m more houses in England before the next election.",
      "Local authorities wouldn't get a say in how many houses they have to build, after areas were given targets. But they would get a say in how to manage housing growth in their region, helping identify areas for building and making decisions on affordable housing.",
      "They'd also be able to charge developers a levy to help pay for the infrastructure needed to support the increase in homes, such as roads, major junctions and reservoirs. They'd also have a say in freight and logistics.",
      "And mayors would be able to intervene in planning applications they see to be strategically important to an area - similar to the government saying they'll intervene in applications that are strategically important to the whole country, like prisons.",
      "A right to buy pubs, historic buildings and sports facilities",
      "Local communities currently have a right to bid for local community assets that are at risk of being lost.",
      "This includes things like sports facilities, historic buildings, pubs, libraries and cafes, as well as local news outlets and youth clubs.",
      "The government says it wants to replace this right to bid with a right to buy, with funding available to purchase community assets.",

      "\"For all of those reasons, using all the channels that we have available, and those are diplomatic and of course intelligence-led channels, we seek to deal with HTS where we have to.\"",
      "The diplomatic contact with HTS does not mean the foreign secretary has personally been in touch with the rebel group.",
      "Whitehall sources say the contact referred to is permitted under the terms of existing terrorism legislation, under which, for example, NGOs would be able to have contact in order to provide humanitarian assistance.",
      "Such contact does not mean that the UK's listing of HTS as a terrorist group is being lifted. But it does indicate that the UK government has embarked on a process of judging HTS on the basis of its actions.",

      "The Home Builders Federation (HBF), along with the UK's largest housebuilder Barratt Redrow said skills shortages, ageing workers and Brexit were some of the factors behind the shrinking workforce.",
      "The government confirmed there was a \"dire shortage\" of construction workers but said it was \"taking steps to rectify\" the problem.",
      "Last week, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer repeated the pledge he made soon after taking power to deliver 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029.",
      "And on Thursday he unveiled sweeping changes to the planning system and vowed to override \"blockers\" standing in the way of building the new homes.",
      "Labour hopes building more homes will reduce house prices and make buying and renting homes more affordable, especially for younger people.",
      "Its target means building an average of 300,000 new homes a year - in recent years the number has been about 220,000.",
      "The current workforce is estimated to be 2.67 million, according to the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB).",
      "But for every 10,000 new homes to be built, the sector needs about 30,000 new recruits across 12 trades, according to the HBF, the trade body for the house building industry in England and Wales.",

      "\"They're challenging targets, I think we have to recognise that this is a national crisis,\" Mr Thomas said.",

      "The industry body admitted the sector itself had not \"attracted\" enough new recruits in recent years.",
      "All of these factors over time has resulted in an ageing workforce, with a quarter of workers being aged over 50, it said.",

      "Sir Brian Leveson, a retired High Court judge, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme \"radical\" steps would need to be taken to tackle the \"crisis\" which has seen cases added to the criminal justice system \"faster than they can be removed.\"",
      "Figures released by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) show 73,105 trials were unheard at the end of September, almost double the number in 2019.",
      "Sir Brian's report, due next year, will consider the creation of intermediate courts, where cases could be heard by a judge flanked by magistrates, to reduce the backlog.",
      "Speaking for the first time since the announcement of the review, Sir Brian said the number of prosecutions waiting to be dealt with was \"unsustainable\" - with listings now running into 2027.",
      "\"This isn't so much a challenge,\" he told the BBC, \"it's a crisis in the criminal justice system which has to be addressed\".",
      "Adding: \"It isn't acceptable for victims, it isn't acceptable for witnesses who have to - bear in mind - remember what had happened and be able to deal with it so many years later, it isn't acceptable for defendants who have allegations hanging over their heads for years and years.\"",
      "Figures published by the MoJ  on Thursday showed the backlog in Crown Courts at the end of September was up 10% in a year.",
      "Asked whether the number of cases being dealt with in the courts needed to be considered, Sir Brian said: \"I think that's a good question, and one of the issues that will have to be considered.",
      "\"The extent to which we can divert people from the criminal justice system is a live one and that's one of the areas I will be looking at,\" he said, adding intermediate courts currently do not exist, \"so you're either in the magistrates' court or you're in a Crown Court.\"",
      "One suggestion is that the jury could be replaced in many middle-ranking cases by a single district judge and two community magistrates.",
      "Sir Brian would consider whether magistrates should have a broader remit to deal with more cases, potentially including increasing their sentencing powers.",
      "On Thursday, Justice Secretary, Shabana Mahmood described the backlog as \"unprecedented\".",
      "\"We owe it to victims to find bold, innovative approaches that will speed up justice,\" she said, adding criminals should know \"they will quickly face the consequence of their actions.\"",
      "The review was also welcomed by the chair of the Magistrates' Association which said its members were willing to help with the backlog - with \"highly trained\" magistrates already dealing with 90 per cent of criminal cases.",
      "However, the chair of the Criminal Bar Association - which represents barristers who are central to Crown Court cases - said the review had to also address how much cash was available for justice.",
      "\"Action and investment into the criminal courts system is needed now,\" said Mary Prior KC.",
      "Former judge Sir Brian, also made reference to the widespread disorder over the summer which spread across the UK following the killing of three girls in Southport.",
      "Fuelled by a surge of online misinformation, the riots saw buildings including mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers vandalised and dozens of police officers injured.",
      "\"The best deterrent to crime is speedy justice,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that was revealed recently during the riots, where cases were put through the courts very quickly and those riots died down.",
      "\"People were being sentenced, convicted, tried, all within a speedy time,\" said Sir Brian, \"and that's the way we deter crime best - by early detection, early prosecution and early resolution.\"",
      "Sir Brian's report will land on ministers' desks around the same time as a parallel review of sentencing of offenders.",
      "If both reviews recommend major changes, and ministers accept those ideas, they would represent the most significant changes to the criminal justice system in a generation.",

      "The UK economy shrank for the second month in a row in October as concerns about the Budget continued to weigh on confidence.",
      "Official figures showed a 0.1% drop, despite expectations that the economy would return to growth after a fall in September.",
      "The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said that activity had stalled or declined with pubs, restaurants and retail among sectors reporting \"weak months\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the figure was \"disappointing\", but added: \"We have put in place policies to deliver long-term economic growth.\"",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said: \"This fall in growth shows the stark impact of the chancellor's decisions and continually talking down the economy.\"",
      "KPMG's chief economist Yael\u202fSelfin said that activity was \"held back by uncertainty ahead of the Budget on 30 October\" as businesses and consumers held back on spending.",
      "But some industries, such as real estate, law firms and accountancy, brought forward work before Reeves announced the Budget, the ONS said.",
      "Separately, a survey measuring consumer confidence in December found people were a little more positive about their personal finances for the year ahead.",
      "But the findings from market research firm GfK found that \"views on the economy are unchanged from November which suggests people don't know where we are going\".",
      "\"In a nutshell, it's the continuing uncharitable view on the UK's general economic situation that's suppressing consumer confidence,\" said Neil Bellamy, consumer insights director at NIQ GfK.",
      "Shortly after becoming prime minister in July, Sir Keir Starmer warned that the Budget would be \"painful\" following 14 years of Tory government.",
      "He later denied that he was talking down the economy.",
      "The economy has grown just once over the past five months, ONS figures show.",
      "Capital Economics said GDP was 0.1% lower than before Labour won the election in July.",
      "\"That suggests it's not just the Budget that is holding the economy back,\" said Capital's chief UK economist Paul Dales.",
      "\"Instead, the drag from higher interest rates may be lasting longer than we thought.\"",
      "The Bank of England has cut interest rates twice this year but, at 4.75%, they are still relatively high compared with recent years.",
      "The Bank will meet next week for the last interest rate decision of 2024, though it is not widely expected to reduce borrowing costs again until next year.",
      "Economists cautioned about placing too much emphasis on the reading for October.  It is an initial estimate of economic growth by the ONS and could be revised.",
      "Over the three months to October, the economy expanded by 0.1%.",
      "'People are still cautious'",
      "The manufacturing industry recorded the sharpest drop in activity in October, down 0.6%, followed by construction which fell by 0.4%.",
      "Meanwhile, the services sector, which makes up the bulk of the UK economy,  stalled with zero growth.",
      "Rick Gaglio, owner of menswear shop Twisted Fabric in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, said \"people are still being cautious\", and added that prices are still comparatively high.",
      "\"That's just down to inflation and customers are feeling those price increases,\" he said.",
      "Mr Gaglio also said that retail sales were slow during the summer months due to wetter than usual weather.",
      "\"It's been tough,\" he said. \"2024 generally for small businesses has been very, very tough and we just want to hear more good news, not bad news.\"",
      "Sir Keir has said he wants the UK to secure the highest sustained economic growth of the G7 group of rich nations.",
      "Last week, he set out additional \"milestones\" to allow people to measure the government's progress. On the economy, he has pledged to increase real household disposable income per person.",

      "A baroness who called a peer of Indian origin \"Lord Poppadom\" is facing a suspension from the House of Lords after an investigation found her comments amounted to harassment \"related to race\".",
      "The Lords' Conduct Committee recommended suspending Conservative Baroness Meyer for three weeks.",
      "It also rebuked her for touching a black MP's hair without permission. She initially denied making the remarks, but later apologised for both incidents.",
      "Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said people should \"treat each other with respect\".",
      "The committee also recommended suspending Lord Stone of Blackheath, a former Labour peer, for six months for bullying, after he called security staff \"thick\" and \"stupid\".",
      "The committee upheld a complaint that Lady Meyer twice used the derogatory term to refer to Lord Dholakia during a taxi ride during a visit to Rwanda with parliament's Joint Committee on Human Rights in February.",
      "The comments came after Lady Meyer had earlier mistaken him for Lord Popat, another peer of southeast Asian heritage, the report states.",
      "Lord Dholakia was in the car but did not initially hear the comments. Others on the committee confronted her over the remarks, including Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, the report heard.",
      "Lady Meyer initially denied using the term, but faced with evidence from two witnesses she admitted she may have said it - blaming a long day and a dinner where she drank \"possibly three glasses of wine\".",
      "The investigation found Lady Meyer's behaviour towards Lord Dholakia had breached harassment rules with a \"racial element\".",
      "She then asked Ribeiro-Addy if she could touch her braids, and did so before receiving a reply.",
      "Ribeiro-Addy said she laughed off the incident but said it made her feel \"extremely uncomfortable\".",
      "Lady Meyer said she saw Ribeiro-Addy's reaction and instantly regretted her actions.",

      "She was appointed to the House of Lords by Theresa May in 2018.",
      "Asked about the committee's findings during a visit to Essex on Friday, Badenoch said it was important the rulings were followed.",
      "\"We need to make sure that we all treat each other with respect at all times,\" she added.",
      "Earlier, Conservative peer Lord Greenhalgh said he was \"surprised and disappointed\" by Lady Meyer's comments.",
      "\"The use of that sort of language is not what I would have expected from my Conservative colleague,\" he told the BBC.",
      "After a separate investigation the committee called for Lord Stone to be suspended for six months after finding he had bullied parliamentary security staff.",
      "The former Marks and Spencer executive admitted to using an \"aggressive\" tone when contacted by security staff after leaving his suitcase unattended by an entrance to the parliamentary estate, contrary to the rules.",
      "The report said: \"In subsequent exchanges with security officers, on the telephone and in person, Lord Stone raised his voice, gesticulated, spoke over them and described (an officer) as 'thick and stupid'.\"",
      "He refused to move his suitcase and used rude and offensive language.",
      "Lord Stone appealed against an initial investigation by the Lords' Standards Commissioner that found he had bullied the staff, but the Conduct Committee upheld the findings.",
      "He had previously been found to have sexually harassed staff by the Commissioner in 2019, leading to him losing the Labour whip.",
      "After two allegations against him were upheld, he agreed to take part in a course of \"bespoke training and behaviour coaching sessions\".",
      "In Thursday's report, the committee said: \"The present case demonstrates that the clear pattern of Lord Stone's poor behaviour continues.",
      "\"Despite the hope we expressed in 2020, Lord Stone appears to have no greater insight into his behaviour now than he did then.",
      "\"His continued inability to control his behaviour and to treat staff with respect and courtesy is unacceptable.\"",

    "story": [
      "The government is not \"waging war on rural England\" with plans to force councils to allow more homes to be built in their areas, the housing minister has said.",
      "Matthew Pennycook hit back at Conservative claims the government was \"concreting over\" green belt land.",
      "He told MPs new housing targets for local councils were focused on parts of the country where housing was least affordable - and it was \"wrong\" to say rural areas would bear the brunt of the changes.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has made increasing housebuilding a key priority, promising 1.5 million new homes in England over the next five years.",
      "\"Our plan for change will put builders not blockers first, overhaul the broken planning system and put roofs over the heads of working families and drive the growth that will put more money in people's pockets,\" said the PM.",
      "However, councils, including some Labour-run authorities, have previously raised concerns higher housing targets will be almost impossible to achieve.",
      "They point to strains on local infrastructure, land shortages and a lack of capacity in the construction industry as among the constraints on housebuilding.",
      "The government has said councils must meet their housing targets and that, if they refuse to put a local plan in place to do this, ministers will intervene and in extreme cases could take over plans themselves.",
      "Housing campaigners have welcomed the policy, saying it is vital for addressing the shortage of homes.",
      "Eve McQuillan, who is 31 and lives in east London, is one of the millions of people across the country trying to get on the housing ladder.",

      "\"Ultimately, for my generation, it's just not possible, it is just so expensive.\"",
      "Neil Jefferson, chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, also welcomed the changes to the planning system.",

      "Woman with \u00a350,000 savings still can't buy a house",
      "Under the updated National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), previously developed land - known as \"brownfield\" sites - will be prioritised for new homes.",
      "However, Pennycook told the House of Commons brownfield land alone would not be enough to deliver the number of homes the country needed.",
      "Councils will also be ordered to review green belt boundaries - which were created to prevent urban sprawl - by identifying lower-quality \"grey belt\" land that can be built on.",
      "Building on green belt land, which is higher quality, will be allowed if other options have been exhausted - but it must comply with a set of \"golden rules,\" the government said.",
      "Developers will need to prioritise necessary infrastructure, such as nurseries and GP surgeries, as well as guarantee affordable housing and access to green spaces.",
      "It is still not clear what will count as grey belt land.",
      "The government has previously given disused petrol stations and car parks as examples.",
      "It gave some further explanation in the document, such as land that does not preserve the character of historic towns - but councils will have to wait until the new year for full guidance.",
      "Pennycook said the government had listened to feedback from councils who wanted housing to be better targeted at areas where affordability pressures were most acute.",
      "London, the south-east and east of England now have higher housing targets than those proposed by the government in July, while the targets for other regions are lower.",
      "However, Conservative shadow housing secretary Kevin Hollinrake said: \"This planning framework pushes development to rural areas, concreting over green belt, green fields and over our green and pleasant land, rather than focusing on supporting building in urban areas, where we need to build the most.\"",
      "He added that it was \"vital\" homes were built in the right places with the right infrastructure and the government would \"bulldoze through the concerns of local communities\".",
      "Craig Bennett, chief executive of the Wildlife Trusts, said there was a danger the environment could suffer from plans to boost housebuilding.",
      "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be \"a colossal, historic missed opportunity\" to build new homes \"in a way that destroys nature, rather than at the same time, restores and rebuilds our natural infrastructure\".",
      "Overall, councils are being told they must reach a combined target of 370,000 new homes a year \u2013 although the government has not set a date for when this will be achieved.",
      "There is an expectation that not all the homes planned for by this target will be delivered within five years.",
      "The government has also promised \u00a3100m of extra funds for councils and 300 additional planning officers to speed up decision-making processes.",
      "It said local authorities would have 12 weeks to come up with timetables for new housebuilding plans or risk intervention from ministers.",
      "The Local Government Association (LGA) said tackling local housing challenges would require a \"collaborative approach\" between councils and the government.",
      "Councils and communities who know their local areas well are \"best placed to make judgement decisions on how to manage competing demand for land,\" LGA spokesman Adam Hug said."

      "The prime minister, his cabinet colleagues and nearly all their political rivals agree that this trade must end. People from all over the world risk their lives to try and get here - and hundreds of communities are affected when those who make it are sent to live in hotels or other accommodation while their cases are dealt with.",
      "But there's huge disagreement over what should be done.",
      "Labour replaced Rishi Sunak's \"stop the boats\" slogan with its own three word mantra: \"smash the gangs\". One of Sir Keir Starmer's first acts was to ditch the Conservatives' plan to send people who arrived in the UK without permission straight to Rwanda.",
      "Conservatives fume that Labour got rid of what might, theoretically, have stopped smugglers and migrants in their tracks. Frankly, we don't even know if the first plane would have left the tarmac, and Conservatives can't be sure that it would have worked as a deterrent \u2013 but the government can't be sure that it wouldn't have.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, who will be on our show on Sunday morning, has instead concentrated on trying to do deals with other countries to stop the criminals who exploit the distress and ambition of those desperate to come to the UK. This weekend we're with her in Italy as she brokers more cooperation with other governments.",
      "The jargon is to \"disrupt at source\", to hamper the gangs, and cut the number of people who get into flimsy rubber boats in the cold seas in the hope of making it to the UK.",
      "There's been no shortage of activity. The measures agreed so far range from the UK paying to help train border security forces in Iraq to a new criminal offence being created to prosecute people smugglers in Germany. There have also been deals with Slovakia, Slovenia, and Kurdistan, as well as cash for Sudan, Chad, Vietnam, and Egypt.",
      "She's also focused on speeding up the system that decides what happens to those who make it here and are living in a horrible limbo, and on returning more people back home. For years the backlog of cases has run to the tens of thousands \u2013 an unhappy status quo.",

      "So the overall approach is pretty clear: make it harder for people to get here without permission, and sort out what happens to those who do much faster.",
      "But clear is not the same as effective.",
      "Since Labour's been in power the number of people making the crossing in small boats has gone up. More than 20,000 have arrived since July, up from 17,000 in the same period last year. And the government has admitted that the number of hotels being used to house asylum seekers has also risen since the election, to more than 35,000 people as of September.",
      "The government is well aware of the unhappiness this causes to some of the public, seeing migrants \"walk on to the coast like they're getting ferries\", one insider says. And there is acknowledgement that this hotel housing causes a \"major problem with social cohesion\", says the same source.",
      "It's not unheard of for Labour MPs and even some now ministers to object publicly to groups of new arrivals, who aren't allowed to work, being put up at the taxpayers' expense in communities without the right support or infrastructure, and without full explanation or support for local people either.",
      "But ending the use of these hotels has become one of the promises Labour made during the election that is proving harder than they suggested to keep.",
      "Cooper's team, though, point to increasing number of failed asylum seekers being returned to their countries, and progress they have made in cutting the backlog of cases stuck in the system.",
      "Neither stopping using hotels nor specifically cutting migration numbers or stopping the boats have made it on to Sir Keir's very public list of \"milestones\". Never fear, say sources in his operation \u2013 it's not a milestone but a \"foundation\". What on earth does that mean? In short, the government is well aware of how important it is that it gets a grip on illegal immigration and sources suggest the PM himself is spending a lot of time concentrating on it, and that it's on the agenda with every world leader he sees.",
      "But No 10 won't repeat the practice of previous administrations, creating specific targets or setting lofty goals on immigration. Maybe it's trap they won't set for themselves.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "That lack of a visible measure of success, however, leaves the government open to accusations that they are not taking the public's concern seriously enough. If there are targets for health, why not immigration? If there are numbers for kids' education, why not boats?",
      "With Nigel Farage's Reform Party on the march in some polls, Labour's opponents are on the hunt for any sniff of a lack of commitment to making immigration a top concern. The Conservatives fume that Labour gave up the chance of a deterrent that may or may not have prevented cross channel journeys taking place. They cite Australia, where boats were turned around and Belgium, where police have intercepted boats in the water.",
      "One Tory strategist said there has been a \"lack of political will\" to solve the problem. The economy relies on migration, so gearing up the government machine to confront legal and illegal immigration requires a more fundamental level of honesty about the trade-offs that are needed, they say.",
      "The criticism comes from inside Labour itself, too.",
      "\"There's a fear, a lack of courage,\" one source in the party tells me \u2013 with others describing Cooper as cautious. The only way to solve the hideous problem of vulnerable people arriving into the UK in a chaotic manner would be to do something entirely different, some argue, such as opening up more safe routes for people to come to the UK or developing so-called humanitarian visas to help those in danger flee their countries (although that wouldn't necessarily stop others making the dangerous small boats journey).",
      "Sir Keir's leadership does not want to argue that it should be easier for people in desperately poor countries to move to the UK. Yet there are Labour voices who say a more grown up and honest conversation is required. Last year, I spoke to five former home secretaries about how hard it was to manage immigration, and they all felt they'd been hampered by the politics of the issue.",
      "Labour, right now, does not want to pick a bolder deterrent, like the Conservatives' Rwanda plan, or a more radical humanitarian approach. As so often, Sir Keir is picking what seems a pragmatic tack \u2013 do reasonable things better, and hope (like hell) that with enough effort, it works.",
      "It is, critics on the right and left say, a muddle in the middle.",
      "As 2025 approaches there is little doubt about the importance or the political emotion that surrounds the issue of illegal immigration. But nothing's obvious about the viability of the government's solutions \u2013 or the success or failure of what they are trying to do.",

      "Those founding members signed the Pacific trade pact in March 2018.",
      "Between them, they generate 13% of the world's income.",

      "Representatives from CPTPP countries signed the rebranded Pacific trade pact in March 2018",
      "What's in it for the UK?",

      "Even with some changes to the trading arrangements with other countries, the gains from the expanded accord is expected to be fairly small - around 0.08% of GDP over 10 years, according to the government's best stab at an estimate, external.",
      "However the Business and Trade Secretary likens CPTPP to a start-up, indicating the estimates do not account for the fact that some members - for example, Vietnam - are rapidly growing in importance in global trade.",
      "Even so, by contrast, leaving the EU, the government's independent forecasters reckon, will have reduced the UK's growth by far more - perhaps 4% of our income, external.",
      "In total, the CPTPP accounted for 8% of UK exports in 2019 - less than we sold to Germany.",
      "What changes?",
      "The key perk is greater access to each others' markets, and a pledge to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges or tariffs.",
      "But some are kept to protect sensitive domestic areas, such as Japan's rice farming industry.",

      "That means they can tick the so-called \"rules of origin\" box, as long as 70% of those components come from any of the participating countries.",
      "The provisions could help UK producers of items such as machinery and medicines - our most valuable exports to those nations - by reducing their costs and allowing them to expand their supply chains across the constituent countries.",
      "Away from trade, membership means investors from CPTPP countries get the same treatment as domestic firms when they put money into projects taking place in other member states, which could benefit UK firms.",
      "In 2017, the CPTPP nations accounted for about \u00a31 in every \u00a312 of foreign investment in the UK, and the same going the other way - supporting business and jobs.",

      "And it is conceding to lower tariffs on imports of Malaysian palm oil - which has been blamed for aiding deforestation. Those charges currently can be up to 12%.",
      "Trade unions have voiced concerns that plans to encourage more investment could allow multinational companies to legally challenge British policies - although trade experts say this capacity exists in other trade deals, and hasn't ever been successfully exercised against the government.",
      "What about the future?",
      "The treaty will be scrutinised and ratified by members before coming into force, which could take at least a year.",
      "It is the partnership's potential that is key.",

      "Cities facing an increase include St Albans, where the target is rising from 885 under the previous Conservative government to 1,660. In Oxford, the target is rising from 762 to 1,087.",

      "There is no official data on the size of the grey belt.",
      "However, estate agent Knight Frank carried out research and identified 11,000 previously developed sites \u2013 making up less than 1% of the green belt.",

      "\"The starting point is local plans, and that's really important for councils to develop the plan according to the target, taking into account local need, and working with developers. So that's where it starts,\" he said.",
      "\"But are we going to push it though if those plans don't work? Yes, yes we absolutely are.\"",
      "Responses from local councils to an Freedom of Information request by the BBC suggest the government could be on a collision course with local authorities.",

      "Of those, 261,471 are classed as \"long-term empty,\" meaning no-one has lived there for six months or more.",

    "summary": "At least 37 people appear to have been butchered and likely eaten in a Bronze Age massacre in Somerset.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists have uncovered the aftermath of an \"exceptionally violent\" attack about 4,000 years ago in Somerset when at least 37 people appear to have been butchered and likely eaten.",
      "It is the largest case of violence between humans identified in early Bronze Age England, which had been considered a peaceful time.",
      "The victims' bones were found by cavers in the 1970s. Experts believe they were thrown into a 15m shaft by the prehistoric attackers.",
      "The massacre was probably driven by a furious \"desire for revenge\" and its effects likely \"echoed through generations\", says Professor Rick Schulting at Oxford university.",
      "He says the victims may have been eaten as a ritual to \"dehumanise\" them and to send a message by \"insulting the remains\".",
      "Around 3,000 fragments of bones found at a cave system called Charterhouse Warren in the Mendip Hills, Somerset, were analysed by a team of archaeologists.",
      "They believe that at least 37 people died, including men, woman and children. Teenagers and older children made up about half of the victims.",
      "Villages in early Bronze Age Britain were made up of around 50 to 100 people, so the experts think this could have equated to wiping-out almost one entire community.",
      "The Bronze Age in Britain lasted from about 2500\u20132000 BC until 800BC, and was a time when bronze replaced stone for making tools and weapons. People developed new agricultural methods, creating large and permanent farms.",
      "In the newly-identified attack there was no evidence of a fight back, suggesting the victims were taken by surprise.",
      "Scrape and cut marks on the bones indicate that the attackers systematically dismembered their victims using stone tools and likely consumed them.",
      "\"If we saw these marks on animal bones, we'd have no question that they were butchered,\" says Prof Schulting.",
      "The scientists do not believe the attackers ate the remains out of hunger because the fragments were found alongside animal bones, indicating there was sufficient food.",
      "The extensive dismembering of the bodies is the first documented case for this era.",
      "There is limited evidence that tension in this era was caused by a fight over resources.",
      "That led the experts to suspect this violence was caused by a huge breakdown in relationships.",
      "\"This was something exceptional. This level of almost erasing the person, literally chopping them into pieces, seems like something you would only do if fuelled by anger, fear and resentment,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "One theory was that someone did \"something horrible that justified this in the eyes of those doing it\", he says.",
      "\"This is not a homicidal maniac. This is a community of people that came together to do this to another community,\" Prof Schulting adds.",
      "He says perhaps a culture of honour led to the attack.",
      "\"If you felt wronged, it was ultimately your responsibility to do something about it. It's not like you could go to the magistrate and ask for something to be done,\" Prof Schulting says.",
      "He suggests that this looks like a case where \"things cycled out of control and normal checks and balances failed.\"",
      "That could be because of one particularly antagonistic person who didn't \"let things rest\" or \"had their own agenda\".",
      "\"If you have those kinds of people on two sides of a conflict, it starts to spiral out of control,\" he suggests.",
      "Experts have usually believed that early Bronze Age England was not particularly violent because very limited signs of conflict have been found.",
      "There is no evidence of weapons like swords or of fortifications that would suggest communities needed to protect themselves.",
      "Before this discovery, only about 10 victims of violent attacks had been found from the period, Prof Schulting says.",
      "The scientists said they do not believe this would have been a one-off attack because \"there would have been repercussions\".",
      "\"But at some point calmer heads probably prevailed and people got on with their lives and some sense of normality returned,\" Prof Schulting suggests.",
      "He cautions that the attack should not be seen as a sign that the past was \"particularly savage and bloody\" or that \"we're beyond all of that now.\"",
      "\"I hope it gives us insights into human nature that extend beyond just the Bronze Age,\" he adds.",

      "While these early European humans were long seen as a species which we successfully dominated after leaving Africa, new studies show that only humans who interbred with Neanderthals went on to thrive, while other bloodlines died out.",
      "In fact, Neanderthal genes may have been crucial to our success by protecting us from new diseases we hadn't previously encountered.",
      "The research for the first time pinpoints a short period 48,000 years ago when Homo sapiens interbred with Neanderthals after leaving Africa, after which  they went on to expand into the wider world.",
      "Homo sapiens had crossed over from the African continent before this, but the new research shows these populations before the interbreeding period did not survive.",
      "Prof Johannes Krause of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Biology, in Germany, told BBC News that the history of modern humans will now have to be rewritten.",
      "\"We see modern humans as a big story of success, coming out of Africa 60,000 years ago and expanding into all ecosystems to become the most successful mammal on the planet,\" he said. \"But early on we were not, we went extinct multiple times.\"",
      "For a long time, deciphering how the only surviving species of humans evolved was based on looking at the shapes of fossilised remains of our ancestors living hundreds of thousands of years ago and observing how their anatomy subtly changed over time.",
      "The ancient remains have been sparse and often damaged. But the ability to extract and read the genetic code from bones that are many thousands of years old has lifted a veil on our mysterious past.",
      "The DNA in the fossils tell the story of the individuals, how they are related to each other and their migration patterns.",
      "Even after our successful interbreeding with Neanderthals, our population of Europe wasn't without hitches.",
      "Those first modern humans that had interbred with Neanderthals and lived alongside them died out completely in Europe 40,000 years ago - but not before their offspring had spread further out into the world.",
      "It was the ancestors of these early international pioneers who eventually returned to Europe to populate it.",
      "The research also gives a new perspective on why Neanderthals died out so soon after modern humans arrived from Africa. No one knows why this happened, but the new evidence steers us away from theories that our species hunted them out of existence, or that we were somehow physically or intellectually superior.",
      "Instead, Prof Krause says that it supports the view that it was due to environmental factors.",
      "\"Both humans and Neanderthals go extinct in Europe at this time,\" he said. \"If we as a successful species died out in the region then it is not a big surprise that Neanderthals, who had an even smaller population went extinct.\"",
      "The climate was incredibly unstable at the time. It could switch from nearly as warm as it is today to being bitterly cold, sometimes within a person's lifetime, according to Prof Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in London, who is independent of the new research.",
      "\"The study shows that near the end of their time on the planet, Neanderthals were very low in numbers, less genetically diverse than the modern human counterparts they lived alongside, and it may not have taken much to tip them over the edge to extinction,\" he said.",
      "A separate DNA study, published in the journal Science, shows that modern humans held on to some key genetic traits from Neanderthals that may have given them an evolutionary advantage.",
      "One relates to their immune system. When humans emerged from Africa, they were extremely susceptible to new diseases they had never encountered. Interbreeding with Neanderthals gave their offspring protection.",
      "\"Perhaps getting Neanderthal DNA was part of the success because it gave us better adaptive capabilities outside of Africa,\" said Prof Stringer. \"We had evolved in Africa, whereas the Neanderthals had evolved outside of Africa.\"",
      "\"By interbreeding with the Neanderthals we got a quick fix to our immune systems.\"",

    "summary": "Read the winning essay from the Young Science Writer of the Year 2024 award",
    "story": [
      "In her award-winning essay, young British science writer Jasmin Notarangelo carried out a very personal investigation into  a pressing global health issue that affects her family directly.",
      "Jasmin\u2019s essay, about managing Type 1 diabetes, won the 2024 Young Science Writer of the Year award. Here is an edited version of that essay.",
      "I am a teenager whose mother and grandmother both have type 1 diabetes.",
      "It is a disease which cannot be cured, only managed - an autoimmune condition, meaning that the body\u2019s defence system attacks cells in the pancreas. These cells are then damaged and cannot produce insulin - the hormone which helps keep blood sugar levels within a safe range.",
      "In people without diabetes, insulin is released when we eat, preventing our blood sugar levels from going too high. That does not  happen to diabetics. Without treatment, their blood sugar can spike - dangerously. Glucose monitors, healthy dietary choices, scheduled exercise, and most importantly insulin injections, are all used to control it.",
      "Insulin injections can be painful. They can cause bruising and a build-up of scar tissue, fat, and protein, which is called lipohypertrophy. As I have seen, these injections can be upsetting and restricting. Diabetics have to have their insulin with them and, for those who have problems with their eyesight, or with their mobility, it can be a struggle to inject.",
      "This is why I believe there is a better, more efficient way to deliver insulin.",
      "Your chocolate bar - my family's struggle",
      "Friendly fungi help forests fight climate change",
      "The insulin pump is a small device - around the size of a deck of cards - which supplies a continuous flow of longer-acting insulin through a cannula underneath the skin. This device comes in two forms, tubed and tubeless. Tubed pumps last for multiple years, with the insulin supply getting replaced every two to three days.",
      "Tubeless pumps are worn once and a new pump is applied every two to three days. They are changed often to stop the insulin supply running out and to prevent infection.",
      "An advantage of the insulin pump is that it allows increased flexibility for people with unpredictable schedules or who require smaller doses of insulin. This means that people with changing work shifts, who don\u2019t necessarily eat and exercise at set times each day can still have set doses of insulin.",
      "A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2011 says that 86% of survey respondents cited that the insulin pump fits in with their lifestyle much better than injections.",
      "It is also more convenient to change an insulin supply or pump every two or three days, than it is to inject, on average, four times a day.",
      "However, there are disadvantages with pumps, as they are not for everyone. It may be difficult for people with eyesight or mobility problems to change their pump, but this issue is also related to insulin injections. Cannulas can also bend, restricting the flow of insulin, and the pump can sometimes become disconnected from the tubing without the user noticing.",
      "The NHS only offers insulin pumps to those who experience frequent episodes of dangerously low or high blood sugar without warning. These are known as \u201chypos\u201d or \u201chypers\u201d. This means that many people choose to self-fund an insulin pump, which typically costs \u00a32,000-\u00a33,000. On top of that, the cost of the equipment needed costs just over \u00a31,000 per year. That is not affordable for many diabetics.",
      "Dr Iain MacLeod., who works as a GP at Prestonpans Group Practice in Scotland told me that insulin pumps had been \u201clife-changing for many patients\u201d.",
      "\u201cI think [they] have been an excellent addition to the range of options available for managing diabetes,\u201d he said.",
      "Dr MacLeod also expressed that pumps  \u201callow more flexibility\u201d, but that they \u201dare a lot more expensive than standard insulin therapy so, in these times of huge financial pressures within the NHS, it is probably not realistic for all diabetic patients to get the more expensive treatment options.",
      "\u201cIf the pump is the best option for a patient, then I would gladly recommend it,\u201d he added.",
      "Insulin pumps are becoming more accessible - and even more fashionable -  with companies selling accessories and pouches to protect pumps. I think this is making it easier to live with and accept the reality of the device, which is often life-changing.",
      "I believe it is important for diabetics to have access to whatever treatment options they need to not just manage their condition, but thrive.",
      "Jasmin is from Musselburgh Grammar School, East Lothian and the judges called her essay an \u201coutstanding piece that presented a compelling message about the accessibility of healthcare\".",
      "Runners up were Anna Joby, for her essay on light pollution and Lissie Marsh for a piece on the unseen environmental consequences of the overuse of tyres.",

      "His biggest fear was of someday needing to have his foot amputated. Vision loss, another possible complication of diabetes, wasn\u2019t really on his radar. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d lose my sight,\u201d says Quinn, who lives in West Yorkshire.",
      "But one day he noticed bleeding in his eye. Doctors told him he had diabetic retinopathy: diabetes-related damage to blood vessels in the retinas. This required laser treatments and then injections.",
      "Eventually the treatments weren\u2019t enough to prevent the deterioration of his vision. He would hurt his shoulder walking into lampposts. He couldn\u2019t make out his son\u2019s face. And he had to give up driving.",
      "\u201cI felt pathetic. I felt like this shadow of a man that couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he remembers.",
      "One thing that helped him climb out of his despair was the support of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which connected him with a black Labrador named Spencer. \u201cHe saved my life,\u201d says Quinn, who is now a fundraiser for Guide Dogs.",
      "In the UK the NHS invites patients for diabetic eye screening every one or two years.",
      "US guidelines are that every adult with type 2 diabetes should be screened at diagnosis of diabetes, and then annually if there are no issues. Yet for many people, that doesn\u2019t happen in practice.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s very clear evidence that screening prevents vision loss,\u201d says Roomasa Channa, a retina specialist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the US.",
      "In the US barriers include cost, communication and convenience. Dr Channa believes that making the tests easier to access would help patients.",
      "To screen for diabetic retinopathy health professionals take pictures of the rear interior wall of the eye, known as the fundus.",
      "Currently, interpreting fundus images manually is \u201ca lot of repetitive work\u201d, Dr Channa says.",
      "But some think that artificial intelligence (AI) could speed up the process and make it cheaper.",
      "Diabetic retinopathy develops in fairly clear stages, which means that AI can be trained to pick it up.",
      "In some cases, AI could decide whether a referral to an eye specialist is needed, or work in tandem with human image graders.",
      "One such system was developed by the health technology company Retmarker, based in Portugal.",
      "Its system identifies fundus images that could be problematic and sends them to a human expert for further investigation.",
      "\u201cNormally we use it more as a support tool to give information to the human to make a decision,\u201d says Jo\u00e3o Diogo Ramos, Retmarker\u2019s chief executive.",
      "He believes that fear of change is limiting the take-up of AI-powered diagnostic tools like this.",
      "Independent studies have suggested that systems like Retmarker Screening and Eyenuk\u2019s EyeArt have acceptable rates of sensitivity and specificity.",
      "Sensitivity is how good a test is at detecting disease, while specificity is how good it is at detecting the absence of disease.",
      "In general, very high sensitivity could be linked to more false positives. False positives create both anxiety and expense, as they lead to unnecessary specialist visits. In general, poor-quality images can lead to false positives in AI systems.",
      "Google Health researchers have been examining the weaknesses of an AI system they developed to detect diabetic retinopathy.",
      "It performed very differently when trialled in Thailand, compared to hypothetical scenarios.",
      "One problem is that the algorithm required pristine fundus images. This was a far cry from the realities of occasionally dirty lenses, unpredictable lighting, and camera operators with different levels of training.",
      "Researchers say they have learned lessons about the importance of working with better data and consulting a wide range of people.",
      "Google is confident enough in its model that in October, the company announced that it was licensing it to partners in Thailand and India. Google also said that it was working with the Thai Ministry of Public Health to assess the cost-effectiveness of the tool.",

      "More on AI and Medicine",
      "Cost is a very important aspect of the new technology.",
      "Mr Ramos says that Retmarker's service could cost around \u20ac5 per screening, though with variations according to volume and location. In the US, medical billing codes are set considerably higher.",
      "In Singapore, Daniel S W Ting and colleagues compared the costs of three models of diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "The most expensive was human assessment. However, full automation was not the cheapest, because it had more false positives.",
      "The most affordable was a hybrid model, where the initial filtering of results was performed by AI, before humans took over.",
      "This model has now been integrated into the Singapore Health Service\u2019s national IT platform and will be going live in 2025.",
      "However, Prof Ting believes that Singapore has been able to achieve cost savings because it already had robust infrastructure for diabetic retinopathy screening.",
      "So the cost-effectiveness is likely to vary greatly.",
      "Bilal Mateen, the chief AI officer at the health NGO PATH, says that the cost-effectiveness data around AI tools to preserve eyesight has been fairly strong in rich countries like the UK, or a few middle-income countries like China. But that isn\u2019t the case for the rest of the world.",
      "\u201cWith the rapid advances in what AI is capable of doing, we need to ask less if it\u2019s possible, but more and more whether we\u2019re building for everyone or just the privileged few. We need more than just effectiveness data for effective decision-making,\u201d Dr Mateen urges.",
      "Dr Channa points to the health equity gap even within the US, which she hopes that this tech can help bridge. \u201cWe do need to expand it to places that have even more limited access to eye care.\u201d",
      "She also stresses that older people and people with vision problems should see eye doctors, and the convenience of AI for routinely detecting diabetic eye disease should not deter attention to all the other eye diseases. Other eye conditions, like myopia and glaucoma, have proven tougher for AI algorithms to detect.",
      "But even with those caveats, \u201cthe technology is very exciting,\u201d says Dr Channa.",
      "\u201cI would love to see all our patients with diabetes screened in a timely fashion. And I think given the burden of diabetes, this is a really potentially great solution.\u201d",
      "Back in Yorkshire, Mr Quinn certainly hopes the new tech takes off.",

    "summary": "Quentin Sommerville is on patrol with HTS in Latakia, as they pledge to protect minorities.",
    "story": [
      "Noor stands trembling in the chill afternoon light of the courtyard, not from the cold, but from fear.",
      "Dressed in her thick winter coat, she has come to make a complaint to the men of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), Syria's new de-facto rulers, and the new law in town.",
      "She begins to cry as she explains that three days earlier, just before nine in the evening, armed men had arrived in a black van at her apartment in an upscale neighbourhood of the city of Latakia. Along with her children and her husband, an army officer, she was forced out onto the street in her pyjamas. The leader of the armed men then moved his own family into her home.",
      "Noor - not her real name - is Alawite, the minority sect from which the Assad family originates, and to which many of the former regime's political and military elite belonged. Alawites, whose sect is an offshoot of Shia Islam, make up around 10% of Syria's population, which is majority Sunni. Latakia, on Syria's north-west Mediterranean coast is their heartland.",
      "As with other cities, an array of different rebel groups have rushed into the power vacuum left after Assad's soldiers abandoned their posts. The regime had exploited sectarian divisions to maintain its grip on power, now the Sunni Islamist HTS has pledged to respect all religions in Syria. But Latakia's Alawite population is fearful.",
      "Some people haven't even left their homes since the regime change because they worry that there will be a reckoning, and that they will have to pay a heavy price for the support of the old regime.",
      "Noor shows CCTV footage from her apartment, to 34-year-old Abu Ayoub, HTS general security commander. In the film, a group of bearded fighters, some wearing baseball caps and others in military fatigues, is pictured on her doorstep.",
      "They are not from HTS, she says, but another group, rebels from the northern city of Aleppo.",
      "\"They broke down the door. There were 10 militants at our door and 16 others waiting down the street with three cars,\" Noor tells Abu Ayoub. His men are mostly from Idlib and Aleppo, where the HTS and allied rebel factions were based before launching the offensive that overthew Assad three weeks ago. They stand around in combat fatigues, holding their rifles and listening intently as she describes how the family's belongings were thrown into the street.",
      "HTS was once aligned with al-Qaeda and is still proscribed as a terror organisation by most Western countries, although the UK and US say they have been in contact with the group. In a matter of weeks, it has gone from enemy of the state to the law of the land. Abu Ayoub and his men are adjusting to the change in roles from revolutionaries to policemen.",
      "Noor is only one of a long line of complainants who have come to their general security station with grievances. The base, the city's former military intelligence headquarters, was perhaps the most feared place in Latakia. Now it is a shambles, with broken radios and equipment scattered across the courtyard. Torn portraits of Bashar al-Assad lie in the dirt.",
      "A man joins the queue of those making complaints. He has a black eye, broken ribs, and his shirt is torn and bloodied. He says men from Idlib had broken into his apartment.",
      "\"Some of them were civilians, some wore military clothes and were masked,\" he says. \"They hit my daughter and aimed weapons at my son's head. They stole money, they stole gold.\"",
      "Every call-out here is a show of force, especially with so many armed groups in the city. With the man's son directing them, the HTS security force drives to one of the poorer neighbourhoods, weaving through a warren of back streets, past scrapyards and middens.",
      "The armed police take up positions along the street and at the doorway of the apartment. They bring two suspects back to the station for questioning.",
      "But they barely have time to clear their weapons when there is another complaint, a dispute over gas bottles that left another man beaten.",
      "He says three men had pulled guns on him.",
      "Another race in the cars to a crowded commercial and residential neighbourhood. When the police pull a suspect out into the street - his face still bloody from the earlier fight - local women come to their balconies and shout \"Shabiha! Shabiha!\". They are accusing the suspect of being a member of the shadowy militia force, mostly made of Alawite men, who did the Assad regime's dirty work.",
      "Since its lightning-fast sweep to victory across Syria, Islamist HTS has pledged to keep the peace and protect all of the country's minorities. And every day Abu Ayoub has to make good on that pledge.",
      "\"Some infiltrators into the revolution, some saboteurs, and some weak-minded people are taking advantage of the situation in the areas that were recently liberated,\" he says.",
      "Abu Ayoub admits the situation in the city was \"a bit chaotic\" but turns his attention to Noor. \"We are here now, we weren't here when the army left. We were initially in Damascus and then we came. They are thugs, and we will evict them from your house. We will return your belongings. You have my word,\" he said. And with that he orders his men into their pickup trucks and with sirens blaring they head for the apartment.",
      "Latakia is a city liberated. Last Friday, tens of thousands of people from all sects, gathered on the streets to celebrate the downfall of the Assad dynasty. In a city square, they sat atop the plinth where the statue of Hafez al-Assad, Bashar's father - who ruled for 29 years before his death in 2000 - once stood, and joyfully waved the flag of a free Syria.",
      "The message that day was unity, of one Syria, without sectarian division. But after half a century of tyrannical rule from a regime which fanned sectarian hatred and warned that Alawites would be massacred if they ever lost power, it is an adjustment to say the least.",
      "On Saturday, three HTS fighters were killed, and 14 injured outside the city, in what it said was gun battle with a criminal gang. HTS, which is trying to maintain calm, claims there was no sectarian element to the attack.",
      "On the way to Noor's apartment, the HTS convoy speed through the streets and passersby cheer them and flash the peace sign.",
      "The new Syrian flag, with its green instead of red stripe, and three red stars instead of two green, is commonplace on shop shutters and hanging from balconies. But in Alawite areas, people mostly watch in silence as the convoy moves along. There are fewer new flags in evidence.",
      "Azam al-Ali, 28, an HTS security officer from Deir al-Sour in eastern Syria sits in the front seat. After so much oppression, he says, it will take time for people to trust authority again.",
      "\"Most of the oppressed that come with complaints are from two sects, the Sunni and the Alawite. We do not differentiate. But the extreme poverty that this regime left behind caused this vast chaos,\" he tells me as the traffic parts for the convoy.",
      "And he notes that Alawites, some of whom were among the poorest in Syria, suffered too under the Assad regime.",
      "We arrive at Noor's apartment and half a dozen armed HTS men hurry up the stairs.",
      "The woman behind the door refuses to open up, but after some negotiation the door opens, and she and her family are ordered to leave. Noor goes in to retrieve some clothes and books for her daughter who is studying for exams. Weapons and ammunition belonging to the rebel squatters are confiscated.",
      "\"When I went to HTS today I was terrified,\" says Noor. \"Their appearance was so intimidating and frightening. Honestly, though, they were very nice.\"",
      "But she won't be returning to the apartment. One nightmare has ended in Syria, and for Alawites, another has begun, she says.",
      "As she clutches her belongings, Noor says she no longer feels safe in her home.",
      "\"It's impossible for me to live here again. I do have hope, but not in the near future. At the moment I don't dare.\""

    "story": [
      "Angolan tycoon Isabel dos Santos, once dubbed \"Africa's richest woman\", has hit out at the UK for imposing sanctions on her, telling the BBC the move came as a surprise as she had not been found guilty of \"any corruption in any court in any country\".",
      "Last month, the daughter of Angola's former president was described by the UK government as a \"notorious kleptocrat\" and slapped with an asset freeze and travel ban for allegedly siphoning wealth out of oil-rich Angola.",
      "She said Angola's government was behind a campaign to tarnish her image.",
      "\"It's political at the end of the day,\" Dos Santos, 51, told the BBC Africa Daily podcast from her base in Dubai.",
      "\"There was not an inquiry, where somebody came and investigated and looked at evidence or asked me to clarify. There was no due process,\" she said.",
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced the sanctions on Dos Santos as part of his campaign to crack down on \"dirty money\".",
      "A government statement alleged she had \"systematically abused her positions at state-run companies to embezzle at least \u00a3350m [$442m], depriving Angola of resources and funding for much-needed development\".",
      "A spokesperson for Angola's attorney-general said it was not a political institution and only investigated evidence of alleged criminality. They said she had been accused of several crimes and so needed to defend herself.",
      "A spokesperson for the British foreign office said that under Global Anti-Corruption Sanctions Regulations, the UK could \"designate an individual where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual is or has been involved in serious corruption\". They also pointed out that anyone sanctioned could ask for a review at any time.",
      "The allegations against Dos Santos, which she denies, were first made in 2020 when BBC Panorama reported on leaked documents that had been shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ).",
      "The expos\u00e9 , known as \"Luanda Leaks\", alleged that one of the most suspicious deals had been made via a London-based company.",

      "Africa's richest woman 'ripped off Angola'",
      "Angola's Isabel dos Santos eyes the presidency",
      "Dos Santos, the eldest daughter of former President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos - in power from 1979 to 2017 - was educated at private schools in the UK during Angola's long civil war.",
      "After graduating from King's College London as an electrical engineer, she took up an office job at a consultancy firm in Europe.",
      "But in her early twenties, Dos Santos decided she wanted to pursue a more entrepreneurial career back home, telling the BBC she started out by delivering crates of beer - Uber style - to restaurants and shops.",
      "She went on to build a huge business empire, setting up a mobile phone company, a satellite TV operator, a commercial bank, a brewery and a cement factory - with stakes in other companies in Angola and Portugal.",
      "A month before her 40th birthday, she made it to Forbes magazine's rich list and was not only said to be Africa's richest woman but also the continent's youngest billionaire.",
      "Dos Santos told BBC Africa Daily she never thought of herself in that way but did see herself as a \"pioneer\".",
      "\"I'm also my country's largest private employer. I've created over 200,000 jobs. I've been one of my country's largest taxpayers and contributed the most to build Angola's economy.\"",
      "In 2016, she was controversially put in charge of the struggling state-owned oil firm, Sonangol. Her appointment was challenged by critics at the time but the Supreme Court stood by it, she said.",
      "\"I did have a track record in the private sector. I have a particular knowledge of turning around companies... that are not doing well, to drive them to efficiency.\"",
      "Some of the most serious allegations of corruption against her date from her time in charge of Sonangol.",
      "Within months of her father stepping down in 2017, she was sacked by his chosen successor, President Joao Louren\u00e7o, and two years later her assets were frozen.",
      "The former first daughter of Angola believes Louren\u00e7o, who targeted the Dos Santos family as part of an anti-corruption drive, has betrayed her father: \"He started blaming the past, saying that everything that happened before him was bad.",
      "\"But he himself is from the [ruling] MPLA, he was the vice-president of the party. He was minister of defence.",
      "\"If anything, I think he had a lot more to do with the Angolan economy and the Angolan decision-making and the political decision-making than most Angolans.\"",
      "Dos Santos is also angry that despite her assets being frozen in Angola five years ago, the case has not yet been heard in court - something she says would usually happen within, at most, 18 months as it is a civil case that tends to involve allegations of unpaid debts. She says she faces no criminal proceedings.",
      "She also alleges that the original freezing order was based on faked documents, including a passport in her name bearing the signature of late martial arts expert Bruce Lee.",
      "The spokesperson for Angola's attorney-general said they would not discuss the details of any ongoing legal disputes in public but said that any evidence that documents had been falsified should be presented in court.",
      "By 2021 Forbes had dropped her from its list of top billionaires - Dos Santos explains that the asset freeze means she can no longer get dividend payments and is barred from receiving any financial contributions from her companies.",
      "The mother of three has also had to contend with personal losses over the last few years - her husband died in a diving accident and when her father died in 2022, she did not go back to Angola to attend his funeral.",
      "If she were to return to Angola, she may well face arrest - at the government's behest, Interpol has issued a Red Notice, which is a request to \"locate and provisionally arrest\" someone, however it is not an international arrest warrant.",
      "Dos Santos says after these difficult years and further asset freezes, she now wants people to hear her side of a \"complex\" story to \"hopefully start clarifying the misconceptions that exist\".",
      "When asked if she would ever stand for the presidency, she said it was \"a possibility\" - echoing comments she made to the BBC four years ago.",
      "\"Look, I will always serve my country,\" she said. \"To lead is to serve, and I wish to serve Angola, whether it's in politics, or whether it's in business, whether it's in philanthropy, or culture.\"",

    "story": [
      "Iran's National Security Council has paused the implementation of the controversial \"hijab and chastity law\", which had been due to come into force on Friday.",
      "President Massoud Pezeshkian called the legislation \"ambiguous and in need of reform\", signalling his intention to reassess its measures.",
      "The proposed new law - which would introduce harsher punishments for women and girls for exposing their hair, forearms or lower legs - had been heavily criticised by rights activists.",
      "The strict dress codes imposed on women and girls, which have been treated as a national security priority by the rulers of the Islamic Republic of Iran for decades, have previously triggered protests.",
      "Under the new law, repeat offenders and anyone who mocked the rules would face heavier fines and longer prison sentences of up to 15 years in jail. It would also mandate that businesses report anyone who violates the rules.",
      "Human rights groups had expressed alarm. Amnesty International said Iranian authorities were \"seeking to entrench the already suffocating system of repression\".",
      "During the presidential election in July, then candidate Pezeshkian openly criticised the treatment of Iranian women over the hijab issue.",
      "He promised not to interfere in their personal lives, a stance that resonated with many Iranians, especially from a younger generation frustrated by the government's rigid control.",
      "Masoumeh Ebtekar, a former vice-president for women and family affairs, also criticised the law, saying: \"The new legislation is an indictment of half the Iranian population.\"",
      "The hijab debate gained further momentum last week when Parastoo Ahmadi, a popular Iranian singer, was arrested after streaming a virtual concert with no audience present on YouTube while not wearing the hijab.",
      "The concert quickly went viral and the arrest of Ahmadi and her bandmates sparked widespread backlash. Facing public outcry, authorities released them the following day.",
      "Tensions surrounding the hijab have remained high since nationwide protests in 2022 triggered by the death of Mahsa \"Zhina\" Amini, a young Kurdish woman who died in police custody after being detained for allegedly violating the dress code.",
      "Over the past two years, many young Iranian women have defiantly removed their hijabs in public, challenging the government's authority.",
      "Last week, more than 300 Iranian rights activists, writers and journalists publicly condemned the new hijab law, calling it \"illegitimate and unenforceable\" and urged Pezeshkian to honour his campaign promises.",
      "Despite pressure from hardline factions close to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, many younger people in Iran appear to be unafraid to confront the regime's restrictions.",
      "Pezeshkian's supporters believe the new hijab law will fail to discourage young women from defying it and could even worsen the situation.",
      "However, supporters of the legislation have pressured the president to move forward, criticising the National Security Council's hesitation and demanding that he sign the law to clear the path for its enforcement.",
      "The decision to pause its implementation suggests the government fears it could trigger another wave of mass protests, like those seen two years ago."

    "summary": "Despite losing, the result was the outcome the SDP leader wanted and paves the way for early elections.",
    "story": [
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has lost a vote of confidence in parliament, paving the way for early elections on 23 February.",
      "Scholz called Monday's vote and had expected to lose it, but calculated that triggering an early election was his best chance of reviving his party's political fortunes.",
      "It comes around two months after the collapse of Scholz's three-party coalition government, which left the embattled chancellor leading a minority administration.",
      "Ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said it would now be up to voters to \"determine the political course of our country\", teeing up what is likely to be a fiercely fought election campaign.",
      "Losing Monday's no-confidence vote was the outcome Scholz had wanted.",
      "Thanks to the loss, elections can now happen in February, rather than in September as originally scheduled.",
      "There were 207 MPs, mainly from his own party, who voted for Scholz, while 394 voted against him and 116 abstained.",
      "Since Scholz's argumentative three-party governing coalition collapsed in November, he had been reliant on support from the opposition conservatives to pass any new laws, effectively rendering his administration a lame-duck government.",
      "Given Germany's stalled economy and the global crises facing the West, staggering on until the scheduled election date of September 2025 risked being seen as irresponsible by the electorate.",
      "Scholz's Social Democratic Party (SDP) is trailing heavily in opinion polls, while the conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) under Friedrich Merz appears to be on course for a return to government.",
      "Opening the debate ahead of Monday's vote, Scholz said the snap election was an opportunity to set a new course for the country and called for \"massive\" investment, particularly in defence, while Merz said more debt would be a burden for younger generations and promised tax cuts.",
      "'Kamikaze' move",
      "Scholz's decision to stage a vote he expected to lose in order to dissolve his own government was described as a \"kamikaze\" move by the German tabloid Bild - but it is generally the only way a German government can dissolve parliament and spark early elections.",
      "The process was designed specifically by the post-war founders of modern Germany to avoid the political instability of the Weimar era.",
      "This vote of confidence is not a political crisis in itself: it is a standard constitutional mechanism that has been used by modern German chancellors five times to overcome political stalemate - and one Gerhard Schr\u00f6der deployed on two occasions.",
      "However, there is a deeper problem within German politics.",
      "On the surface, the collapse of the coalition was sparked by a row over money. Scholz's centre-left SDP and his Green partners wanted to ease Germany's strict debt rules to finance support for Ukraine and key infrastructure projects.",
      "That was blocked by Scholz's own finance minister, Christian Lindner, who is the leader of the business-friendly liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), which prioritised driving down the debt.",
      "Lindner was sacked and the coalition collapsed. After years of unedifying bickering, you could almost hear the sigh of relief in Berlin's corridors of power - but the underlying cause is more difficult to resolve and more worrying.",
      "Germany's party political system has become more fragmented, with more parties than ever in parliament. The new upstart political forces are also more radical.",
      "In 2017, the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) entered the Bundestag for the first time, winning 12.6%.",
      "In 2021, it slipped to 10.4%, but is now polling at almost 20%.",
      "Germany engulfed by political crisis as Scholz coalition falls apart",
      "Germany plans February election after coalition collapse",
      "The AfD will not get into government because no-one will work with it to form a coalition. But the far-right is eating into the share of the vote that goes to the two centrist big-tent parties which have always put forward modern German chancellors.",
      "The bigger the AfD share is, the more difficult it becomes for mainstream parties to form a stable governing coalition.",
      "That was arguably the underlying problem that pulled apart Scholz's fractious coalition: big-spending left-leaning Social Democrats and Greens trying to work with free-market small-state liberals.",
      "Rather than going away after the next election in February, that problem is likely to get worse. If the far-right wins a fifth of seats in parliament, it could be even more difficult after February to form a stable coalition between like-minded parties.",
      "Another new populist political party could also get into parliament for the first time, the anti-migrant nativist far-left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance BSW, which is named after its firebrand Marxist leader.",
      "The conservatives are leading in the polls, but as things stand their options for coalition partners are limited.",
      "They refuse to work with the far-right and it is hard to imagine they would like to work with the radical left either. The free-market liberals may not even get into parliament, and some conservatives refuse to consider the Greens.",
      "That leaves Scholz's SDP as a possible partner - even though Scholz is likely to be ousted from power after his stint in power saw his popularity plummet.",
      "Whatever the next government looks like, the era of cosy consensual coalitions in Germany seems to be over."

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 00:14:31 GMT",
    "summary": "In the years before the mass rape trial that has shocked France, Gis\u00e8le almost caught Dominique Pelicot.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual abuse",
      "It was November 2011, and Gis\u00e8le Pelicot was sleeping too much.",
      "She spent most of her weekends in a slumber. She was annoyed, because during the week she worked hard as a supply chain manager, and her time off was precious.",
      "Yet she could not seem to stay awake, often drifting off without even realising it and waking hours later with no memory of having gone to bed.",
      "Despite this, Gis\u00e8le, 58, was happy. She counted herself lucky to have her husband of 38 years, Dominique, by her side. Now their three children Caroline, David and Florian were grown, the couple were planning to soon retire and move to Mazan, a village of 6,000 people in France's idyllic southern region of Provence, where Mr Pelicot could go on bike rides and she could take Lanc\u00f4me, their French bulldog, on long walks.",
      "She had loved Dominique since they met in the early 1970s. \"When I saw that young man in a blue jumper it was love at first sight,\" Gis\u00e8le would reflect, much later. They both had complicated family histories marked by loss and trauma, and had found peace with one another. Their four decades together had hit rough patches - frequent financial troubles and her affair with a colleague in the mid-1980s \u2013 but they had made it through.",
      "Years later, when asked by a lawyer to sum up their relationship, she said: \"Our friends used to say we were the perfect couple. And I thought we would see our days through together.\"",
      "By that point, Gis\u00e8le and Dominique were sitting on opposite sides of a courtroom in Avignon, not far from Mazan: she surrounded by their children and her lawyers, and he, dressed in grey, prison-issue clothes, in the defendants' glass box.",
      "He was facing the maximum jail term for aggravated rape and was rapidly becoming known in France and beyond as \u2013 in his own daughter's words \u2013 \"one of the worst sexual predators of the last 20 years\".",
      "But in 2011, when Gis\u00e8le felt she was sleeping too much, she couldn't have guessed that was how things would play out.",
      "She had no idea that, in his late 50s and nearing retirement, her husband Dominique Pelicot had been spending a lot of time on the internet, often talking to users on open forums and chatrooms where sexual material \u2013 often extreme or illegal \u2013 was freely available.",
      "In court, he would later pinpoint that phase as the trigger for his \"perversion\" after a childhood trauma of rape and abuse: \"We become perverted when we find something that gives us the means: the internet.\"",
      "Sometime between 2010 and 2011, a man claiming to be a nurse sent Mr Pelicot photos of his wife, drugged with sleeping pills to the point of unconsciousness. He also shared precise instructions with Mr Pelicot so that he could do the same to Gis\u00e8le.",
      "At first he hesitated \u2013 but not for long.",
      "Through trial and error he realised that with the right dosage of pills he could plunge his wife into a sleep so deep nothing would wake her. They had been lawfully prescribed by his doctor, who thought Mr Pelicot suffered from anxiety due to financial troubles.",
      "He would then be able to dress her in lingerie she refused to wear, or put her through sexual practices she would have never accepted while conscious. He could film the scenes, which she would not have allowed while awake.",
      "Initially, he was the only one raping her. But by the time the couple had settled in Mazan in 2014, he had perfected and expanded his operation.",
      "He kept tranquilisers in a shoebox in the garage, and switched brands because the first tasted \"too salty\" to be surreptitiously added to his wife's food and drink, he said later.",
      "On a chatroom called \"without her knowledge\" he recruited men of all ages to come and abuse his wife.",
      "He would film them too.",
      "He told the court his wife's unconscious state was clear to the 71 men who came to their house over the course of a decade. \"You're just like me, you like rape mode,\" he told one of them in the chat.",
      "As the years went by, the effects of the abuse Ms Pelicot was subjected to at night increasingly began to seep into her waking life. She lost weight, clumps of hair fell out and her blackouts became more frequent. She was riddled with anxiety, certain that she was nearing death.",
      "Her family became worried. She had seemed healthy and active when she had visited them.",
      "\"We'd ring her but most of the time it was Dominique who picked up. He would tell us Gis\u00e8le was asleep, even in the middle of the day,\" said her son-in-law Pierre. \"But it seemed likely because she was doing so much [when she was with us], especially running after the grandchildren.\"",
      "Police station visit changed everything",
      "Sometimes, Gis\u00e8le came close to having suspicions. Once, she had noticed the green colour of a beer her husband had handed her, and hastily poured it down the sink. Another time, she noticed a bleach stain she couldn't recall making on a new pair of trousers. \"You're not drugging me by any chance, are you?\" she remembered asking him. He broke down in tears: \"How can you accuse me of such a thing?\"",
      "Mostly, though, she felt lucky to have him with her as she navigated her health issues. She developed gynaecological problems, and underwent several neurological tests to determine if she was suffering from Alzheimer's or a brain tumour, as she feared, but the results didn't explain the increasing tiredness and the blackouts.",
      "Several years later, during the trial, Dominique's brother Joel, a doctor, was asked how it was possible that medical professionals had never put the clues together and understood Gis\u00e8le was a victim of the little-known phenomenon of chemical submission \u2013 drug-facilitated rape. \"In the field of medicine we only find what we're looking for, and we look for what we know,\" he replied.",
      "Gis\u00e8le only felt better when she was away from Mazan \u2013 an oddity she barely noticed.",
      "It was on her return from one of these trips, in September 2020, that Dominique told her, in floods of tears: \"I did something stupid. I was caught filming under women's clothes in a supermarket,\" she recalled during the trial.",
      "She was very surprised, she said, because \"in 50 years he had never behaved inappropriately or used obscene words towards women\".",
      "She said she forgave him but asked him to promise her he would seek help.",
      "He acquiesced, \"and we left it at that\", she said.",
      "But Dominique must have known the end was near.",
      "Soon after he was arrested in the supermarket, police confiscated his two phones and his laptop, where they would inevitably find more than 20,000 videos and photos of his wife being raped by him and others.",
      "\"I watched those videos for hours. It was troubling. Of course it had an impact on me,\" J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Bosse Plati\u00e8re, the director of the investigation, told the court.",
      "\"In 33 years in the police, I'd never really seen that sort of thing,\" his colleague St\u00e9phane Gal said. \"It was sordid, it was shocking.\"",
      "His team was tasked with tracking down the men in the videos. They cross-checked the faces and names of the men carefully logged by Dominique alongside facial recognition technology.",
      "They were eventually able to identify 54 of them, while another 21 remained nameless.",
      "Some of the men who were unidentified said in conversations with Dominique that they were also drugging their partners. \"That, for me, is the most painful part of the case,\" Mr Bosse Plati\u00e8re said. \"To know that there are some women out there who could still be victims of their husbands.\"",
      "On 2 November 2020, Dominique and Gis\u00e8le had breakfast together before heading to a police station, where Mr Pelicot had been summoned in relation to the upskirting incident. She was asked by a policeman to follow him into another room. She confirmed Dominque was her husband -  \"a great guy, a good man\" \u2013  but denied ever taking part in swinging with him, or engaging in threesomes.",
      "\"I will show you something you won't like,\" the police chief warned her, before showing her a picture of a sexual act.",
      "At first, she didn't recognise any of the two people.",
      "When she did, \"I told him to stop... Everything caved in, everything I built for 50 years\".",
      "She was sent home in a state of shock, accompanied by a friend. She had to tell her children what had happened.",
      "Recalling that moment, Gis\u00e8le said that her \"daughter's screams are forever etched in my mind\". Caroline, David and Florian came down to Mazan and cleared out the house. Later, photos of a seemingly drugged Caroline were also found on Dominique's laptop, although he has denied abusing her.",
      "'You cannot imagine the unimaginable'",
      "David, the eldest child, said they no longer had any family photos because they \"got rid of everything linked to my father there and then\". Within days, Gis\u00e8le's life was reduced to a suitcase and her dog.",
      "Meanwhile, Dominique admitted to his crimes and was formally arrested. He thanked police for \"relieving him of a burden\".",
      "He and Gis\u00e8le wouldn't meet again until they sat facing one another in the Avignon courtroom in September 2024.",
      "By then, the story of the husband who drugged his wife for a decade and invited strangers to rape her had started to ripple across the world, aided by Gis\u00e8le's unusual and remarkable decision to waive her anonymity and open the trial to the public and the media.",
      "\"I want any woman who wakes up one morning with no memories of the night before to remember what I said,\" she stated. \"So that no more women can fall prey to chemical submission. I was sacrificed on the altar of vice, and we need to talk about it.\"",
      "Her legal team also successfully pushed for the videos taken to be shown in court, arguing they would \"undo the thesis of accidental rape\" \u2013 pushing back against the line of defence that the men had not meant to rape Gis\u00e8le as they didn't realise she was unconscious.",
      "\"She wanted shame to change sides and it has,\" a woman who came to watch the trial in Avignon said in November. \"Gis\u00e8le turned everything on its head. We weren't expecting a woman like this.\"",
      "Medical examiner Anne Martinat Sainte-Beuve said that in the wake of her husband's arrest, Gis\u00e8le was clearly traumatised but calm and distant \u2013 a coping mechanism often employed by survivors of terrorist attacks.",
      "Gis\u00e8le herself has said that she is \"a field of ruins\" and that she fears the rest of her life may not be enough to rebuild herself.",
      "Ms Sainte-Beuve said she had found Gis\u00e8le \"exceptionally resilient\": \"She turned what could have destroyed her into strength.\"",
      "Days before the trial started, the Pelicots' divorce was finalised.",
      "Gis\u00e8le has gone back to her maiden name. She went by the name Pelicot for the trial so that her grandchildren could be \"proud\" of being related to her and not ashamed of being associated to Dominique.",
      "She has since moved to a village far from Mazan. She sees a psychiatrist but doesn't take any medication, because she no longer wants to ingest any substance. She continues to go on long walks, but is no longer tired.",
      "In the early days of the trial, Caroline's husband Pierre took the stand.",
      "A defence lawyer asked him about the Mazan years, when Gis\u00e8le was suffering from memory loss and her husband was dutifully accompanying her to unfruitful medical appointments. How could the family not have realised what was happening?",
      "Pierre shook his head.",

      "Indonesia did not commute the sentences of the remaining five, now aged 38 to 48, and they were transported back to Australia as prisoners. However the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that the men are effectively free to live unhindered in Australian society.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:43:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Inside the infamous prison's corridors it becomes clear how hard it will be to mend the Syria that Assad broke.",
    "story": [
      "Saydnaya prison sits on a forbidding hill about half an hour's drive from the centre of Damascus.",
      "In the last few days the entrance has been repainted in the green, white and black of Syria's revolutionary flag. The new colours did not dispel the sinister atmosphere of the place.",
      "As I walked through the gates, I thought of the despair that must have gripped the thousands of Syrians who made the same journey.",
      "One estimate is that more than 30,000 detainees were killed in Saydnaya in the years since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. That is a large proportion of the more than 100,000 people, almost all men but including thousands of women \u2013 as well as children \u2013 who disappeared without trace into Bashar al-Assad's gulag.",
      "Other parts of Assad's prison system were less cruel. Phone calls home were allowed, and families were allowed to visit.",
      "But Saydnaya was the dark and rotten heart of the regime. Fear of being consigned there and killed without anyone knowing what had happened was a central part of the Assad regime's system of coercion and repression.",
      "The authorities did not have to tell families who had been incarcerated there. Allowing them to fear the worst was another way of applying pressure. The regime kept its boot on the throat of Syrians because of the power, reach and savagery of its myriad and overlapping intelligence agencies, and because of the routine use of torture and execution.",
      "I was in other infamous prisons in the days after they were liberated, including Abu Salim, the former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi's notorious jail in Tripoli and Pul-e-Charki outside Kabul in Afghanistan.",
      "Neither were as foul and pestilent as Saydnaya. In its overcrowded cells men had to urinate into plastic bags as their access to latrines was limited.",
      "When the locks were smashed open, they left behind their filthy rags and scraps of blankets which were all they had to cover themselves as they slept on the floor. Torture and execution have already been documented in Saydnaya.",
      "In the months to come it is certain that more information about the horrors perpetrated inside its walls will emerge from former inmates.",
      "In Saydnaya's corridors you can see how hard it will be to mend the country Assad broke to try to save his regime. Now that the prison has been broken open, like the country, it has become a microcosm of all the challenges Syria faces since the Assad regime crumpled and was swept away.",
      "The record",
      "One challenge is making a record of exactly what the regime did to its victims. In a sign of how far Syria has come in just a week, volunteers went to the prison to try to preserve Saydnaya's records.",
      "Paperwork is scattered around offices and even on the concrete floor of the prison yard. Families pick up files and sheets of tattered documentation, trying to find a name, a date or a place that they recognise.",
      "The disarray of the records looks as if someone tried to destroy what was done here in the name of Bashar al-Assad's Syria. When dictators and their henchmen fall, making sure they don't take the truth with them is a big part of a better future.",
      "A musician called Safana Bakleh gave her group of volunteers face masks and blue nitrile gloves along with instructions about photographing and collecting documents.",
      "Safana admitted they were amateurs and said they were taking matters into their own hands because the international human rights groups were not there, and evidence and documents were disappearing.",
      "\"Even if one family gets one answer that their loved on is not here anymore is deceased or he died in the hospital it is enough for me\" Safana told me. \"It is very chaotic... Where are the international originations supposed to be documenting all this chaos?\"",
      "It is not just about families getting some release through at least knowing what happened to the disappeared. One day there might be trials of the perpetrators. Documents are evidence.",
      "The truth the volunteers uncovered with their own eyes shocked them. All Syrians knew that the prisons were bad, but Saydnaya was much worse than they expected.  Widad Halabi, one of the volunteers, took off her face mask and broke down in tears after an hour or so looking for evidence in the cell blocks.",
      "\"What I've seen here is a life not fit for humans. I imagined how they lived, their clothes. How did they breathe? How did they eat? How did they feel?",
      "\"It's terrible\u2026 terrible. There are bags of urine on the floor. They couldn't go to the toilet, so they had to put urine in bags. The smell. There's no sun or light. I can't believe people were living here when we were living and breathing our normal lives.\"",
      "Justice, or revenge?",
      "It will be hard for Syrians and their new rulers to track down the people they want to punish. Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia with his family. His brother Maher, with a reputation for violence and corruption as bad as anyone in his extended family, is thought to be in Iraq.",
      "A couple of Assad's cousins ran into rebel fighters as they tried to escape to Lebanon. One of them, according to Reuters news agency, was killed in the resulting shootout.",
      "When I entered Syria a week ago hundreds of cars full of despondent and scared families with some link to the regime, who believed they would be in danger in the new Syria, were leaving, queuing to get over the border into Lebanon. At the same time hundreds were driving in the opposite direction, desperate to get home.",
      "Eventually there might be a legal process to prosecute Bashar al-Assad, members of his family and some of those who carried guns for the regime. Gathering evidence would be part of that. But the exodus in the last hours of the regime and in the confused days and nights that followed means that it will be hard to get to the people responsible.",
      "At Saydnaya prison, families wander through the building, desperate for information, searching for those they've lost, horrified by everything they are seeing. Just being in Saydnaya's cells and corridors, freezing cold in December, reinforces a widespread desire to see the punishment of everyone implicated in the Assad regime's crimes.",
      "A group of men gathered in the prison yard, smoking silently, some leafing through files that they had picked up off the ground. All those I spoke to said that the future must be built on justice for the past. The men in the group, all looking for missing, sons, brothers and cousins, called Saydnaya a mass grave. They want the head of Bashar al-Assad, literally. They murmured agreement when one of them said he had to be decapitated.",
      "One of them, a young man called Ahmed, said he knew the brother he was searching for was alive because he could see him in his dreams. Ahmed himself had spent three years in Saydnaya.",
      "\"It was so bad, the torture, the food, everything. We were suffering.\"",
      "Mohammed Khalaf, an older man, had been searching for his son Jabr since he was dragged from the family breakfast table by thugs from one of the state's intelligence agencies in 2014.",
      "\"We are many. People came from Qamishli, Hasaka, Deir al-Zour, Al Raqqa looking for our loved ones. Thousands are still in the streets looking for their children. It's not just me.\"",
      "Inside one of the cell blocks, young men from Aleppo were warming themselves on a fire that they had lit in a metal tin, burning old prison uniforms that are scattered around every cell. They were looking for brothers who had been detained and then disappeared.",
      "Like many others looking for information or a body at Saydnaya, the men had no money for a hotel. So they camped in the prison where they believe their brothers were consigned and most likely killed.",
      "One of the men from Aleppo, Ezzedine Khalil, wants news of a brother taken by the regime on 1 September 2015. They all know the precise dates.",
      "\"We don't know if he is alive or dead. If he is dead, they should give us his body. They should tell us if he's dead. We just want to know. We want to know what to do next.\"",
      "His friend Mohammed Radwan was looking for a brother and a cousin who were detained in 2012. Rumours were flying around that the night before the fall of the regime, 22 freezer lorries were brought to the prison to remove bodies. The rumours have not been confirmed but Mohammed and Ezzedine were convinced that they were true.",
      "Mohammed looked exhausted and his anger flared up. He addressed himself to Assad.",
      "\"Where did you, pig, take the 22 fridge trucks? Everyone who took part in this crime, and everyone who served her in Saydnaya prison should be brought to justice. Everyone! Even if they were working in cleaning. They should all be brought to account.\"",
      "\"Because if they knew what was happening, at least they should have told the families of the prisoners that their dear ones were killed, slaughtered, hanged or tortured.\"",
      "Both men ended with an Islamic prayer: \"Allah is sufficient for me, and He is the best disposer of affairs.\"",
      "Their hunger to see Assad and his men punished could become one of the drivers of events in the next few months. Syrians want to see their tormentors punished.",
      "Corruption",
      "The extended Assad clan used Syria as their bank account. They helped themselves to stakes in businesses that might make profits. They controlled the lucrative market for telecoms and mobiles. As they raked in cash, Syrians struggled to eke out a living in an economy smashed by war and drained dry by rapacious and corrupt regime favourites. The new rulers of Syria have inherited big debts and an almost worthless currency. A couple of hundred dollars equals a plastic trash bag of bundles of Syrian pounds.",
      "Corruption extended to the prison system. Victims and families desperate to avoid years in a hell-hole were prepared to pay big money to stay out.",
      "Hassan Abu Shwarb served 11 years under sentence of death for terrorism, which was the word the Assad regime used for rebellion. Hassan, a quietly spoken man who is now 31, denies he ever joined an armed group. Instead, he says he was detained at a government office when he was getting documents necessary to apply for a passport so he could accept an offer to study in Canada.",
      "His brother said the family paid a total of $50,000 (\u00a339,509) in bribes on five separate occasions to try to get him out. In all cases the corrupt officials who had offered help for cash pocketed the money without releasing Hassan. A couple of weeks before the regime collapsed yet another corrupt judge offered to free Hassan for another $50,000.",
      "After his arrest Hassan Abu Shwarb was tortured when he was detained for 80 days at a military intelligence interrogation centre. Among other injuries, the torturers broke one of his legs. Hassan says he was with one of his cellmates, a 49-year-old man, when he died after three days of torture. The jailors recorded death from a stroke.",
      "Hassan was overjoyed to get home.",
      "\"When my mother held me after 11 years, I can't describe the feeling. There is nothing like going back to your home and neighbourhood.\"",
      "But like many Syrians, Hassan's optimism about the future starts with determination that the fallen regime's leaders and acolytes should suffer for their deeds.",
      "\"They should be punished. We are human souls, not stones after all. And those who killed should be publicly executed. Otherwise, we won't get through this.",
      "\"We need to forget and move on. This is a happiness for all Syrians. We need to return to our work and responsibility to continue. We need to forget. We turned the page. All the sadness is behind us.\"",
      "The leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has started using his real name, Ahmed al-Sharaa, instead of his war time pseudonym, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani. The name change contains a message about looking ahead. The evidence is that Ahmed al-Sharaa will need to prioritise justice for the deposed regime if he does not want the chaos of people taking matters into their own hands.",
      "The future is hard, and the past is full of pain. Here in Damascus, it feels as if a collective weight has been lifted from the shoulders of a nation.",
      "Syrians know how deep their problems go. To preserve the optimism created by Assad's fall, Syrians want to see progress.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:14:26 GMT",
    "summary": "BBC Africa speaks exclusively to a man from Ghana who was held captive by insurgents in Burkina Faso.",
    "story": [
      "A man from Ghana has told the BBC how he was seized at gunpoint by jihadists in neighbouring Burkina Faso, before being taken to their vast desert camp where he gained a rare insight into their lives - from the children he believed were trained as suicide bombers, to the tunnels they had dug to shield themselves and their armoured tanks from air strikes.",
      "In his first media interview since his 2019 ordeal, the man - whom we are calling James to protect his identity - said his first day at the camp was terrifying as a huge number of Islamist fighters returned from an operation, firing shots in the air.",
      "\"I thought that was the end. I was just sweating,\" James said, adding that he also ended up wetting his pants when some fighters hit him with their guns - and laughed.",
      "James, who is in his 30s and follows a traditional African religion, said the insurgents later attempted to recruit him, enticing him with the allure of power by saying he could one day become the commander of a battalion.",
      "\"The commander brought out a sack. It contained different weapons, AK-47, M16, and G3 [rifles]. So he asked me which of them I could operate, and I said I had never operated one before. He said: 'We have bigger weapons, so if I give you a battalion to handle, no-one can harm you',\" James added.",
      "He said he was lucky to be released about two weeks later after he begged for his freedom, claiming that he had a sick child at home and promising the camp commander that he would become his recruiting-sergeant in Ghana - a promise he says he never kept.",
      "Ghana's National Commission on Civic Education, a government body which is spearheading a public campaign to prevent young people from joining the jihadists, told the BBC that it was aware of James' experience.",
      "\"I met him in an attempt to sensitise tertiary-level students,\" said Mawuli Agbenu, the commission's regional director in the capital, Accra.",
      "\"We will definitely have a way of engaging with him so that he will be an ambassador or an influencer within his community,\" Mr Agbenu added.",
      "Long a stable democracy, Ghana has so far been spared the violence that has seen the insurgency spread, causing havoc in Burkina Faso and its West African neighbours.",
      "The insurgents who kidnapped James belonged to Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM), or The Support Group for Islam and Muslims. An affiliate of al-Qaeda, it was officially launched in 2017 as an umbrella body for various jihadist groups in the region.",
      "In Burkina Faso, they are strongest in the north, where they control large areas, but they have also expanded to the south, along the porous 550km-long (340 mile) border with Ghana.",
      "More than 15,000 people from Burkina Faso have fled into northern Ghana to escape the conflict, aid agencies say.",
      "Apart from Burkina Faso, the jihadists have also gained territory in Niger and Mali, and have carried out attacks in Ivory Coast,  Benin and Togo - all former French colonies - raising fears that the insurgency was spreading south towards the coast.",
      "In April, a senior UN official said that \"the epicentre of terrorism has shifted from the Middle East and North Africa into sub-Saharan Africa, concentrated largely in the Sahel region [which includes Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger]\".",
      "Jihadists linked to both al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS) group operate in the region.",
      "A Ghanaian security officer stationed along the border with Burkina Faso told the BBC that the jihadists often crossed over to regroup when under pressure from Burkina Faso's military - and they also used the country to smuggle weapons, food and fuel.",
      "\"It\u2019s not safe for Ghana. They hide in towns like Pusiga. Residents of border communities are worried because there\u2019s no tight security,\" he added.",
      "In a report released in July, the Netherlands Institute of International Relations think-tank said the \"absence of real attacks on Ghanaian soil seems to result from JNIM's calculus of not disturbing supply lines and places of rest as well as not provoking a relatively strong army\".",
      "\"Examples of people who are spared by JNIM by showing their Ghanaian identity cards fits this reading,\" it added.",
      "Most Ghanaians are Christians, but the population near the border with Burkina Faso is mainly Muslim - and parts of the region have also been riven with ethnic tensions, raising fears that the jihadists could exploit them to their advantage.",
      "The think-tank said that JNIM had attempted in a \"very small number\" of instances to recruit or incite Ghana's small, largely Muslim Fulani community to carry out attacks.",
      "JNIM claimed that they were marginalised, but its recruitment efforts had \"minimal success\" as the Fulani were \"aware of the chaos that has enveloped the Sahel due to familial networks\" and did not want it to occur in Ghana, the think-tank added.",
      "A Fulani Muslim preacher in Burkina Faso, Amadou Koufa, is the co-founder of JNIM and is its second-in-command. He recruits most of his fighters from the Fulani community in Burkina Faso.",
      "The military has been accused by rights groups of retaliating by stigmatising Fulanis, and carrying out indiscriminate attacks on their villages in Burkina Faso.",
      "In 2022, a France-based NGO, Promediation, said its research showed that the jihadists had recruited between 200 and 300 young Ghanaians.",
      "Although some were operating in insurgency-hit countries like Burkina Faso, others had been sent back to their villages in northern Ghana to preach their \"radical faith\", it added.",
      "This could eventually lead to the jihadists gaining \"a sustainable foothold in remote and peripheral areas in the north\", the NGO said.",
      "Since 2022, Ghana has been at the forefront of efforts to create a new Western-backed, 10,000-strong regional force to combat the Islamist insurgency.",
      "Tamale - the biggest city in northern Ghana - is supposed to be the force's headquarters.",
      "However, the headquarters has not yet opened, and the fate of the initiative is unclear after the region split between pro-Western and pro-Russian states.",
      "Burkina Faso - along with Mali and Niger - have pivoted towards Russia. The three countries have formed their own alliance to fight the insurgents, and have also relied on help from Russian mercenaries.",
      "Ghana and other regional states have remained allied with the West.",
      "Ghana's military has established bases in the north, but newly installed border surveillance equipment was not yet working, the security officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the BBC.",
      "However, more troops have been sent since JNIM carried out two attacks, late last month and earlier this month, on the Burkina Faso side of the border, the officer added.",
      "Ghana's government did not respond to a BBC request for comment.",
      "However, its ambassador to Burkina Faso, Boniface Gambila Adagbila, told the BBC the two countries were helping each other to fight the insurgents, warning that if Burkina Faso fails \"Ghana may likely to be the next place\".",
      "Ghana's National Democratic Congress (NDC) party - which will form the next government after winning elections on 7 December - promised in its campaign manifesto to \"enhance\" border security with \"international partners\", as well as improve the country's intelligence capabilities.",
      "In August 2023, the European Union announced that as part of a 20m euro ($21.6m; \u00a316.6m) aid package it would supply Ghana with about 100 armoured vehicles, as well as surveillance equipment such as drones.",
      "Many civilians and refugees cross the Ghana-Burkina Faso border through footpaths and back roads to work, trade or visit relatives despite the security risk - and James said he was one of them. He was travelling all the way to Senegal on his motorbike when he was taken captive.",
      "After riding for nearly a day, he said he encountered the insurgents in north-western Burkina Faso, as he was nearing the border with Mali.",
      "A handful of jihadists, also on motorbikes, stopped him and took him to their camp where he was interrogated until their commander was convinced that he was not a spy, James said.",
      "He added that his blindfold - the trademark black jihadist flag - was then removed.",
      "James said he found about 500 insurgents - mostly young men, including one who identified himself as a doctor - living in the camp.",
      "Located in desert-like terrain, it was made up of thatch-roofed huts, with small electricity-generating solar panels, he said.",
      "He added that the camp was divided into three sections - for commanders and their families, lower-ranking jihadists and captured villagers and soldiers.",
      "James said he was detained in the latter section, but got \"closer\" to the jihadists in the second week as he increasingly acted as though he had become a sympathiser of their cause.",
      "They sat around in groups of five or 10, and listened to the songs of Salif Ke\u00efta, the Malian musician known as the Golden Voice of Africa, James said.",
      "Other jihadist groups have banned music, saying it is un-Islamic.",
      "James said that while the atmosphere at the camp was generally relaxed, groups of jihadists regularly went to fight, firing celebratory shots when they returned, claiming to have achieved battlefield success.",
      "James said he realised that this was the gunfire he had heard on the first day, and got used to it.",
      "He added that the insurgents parked their tanks and pick-up trucks in two inter-connected tunnels to ensure they were not destroyed if there was an air strike, while only a few vehicles remained outside \"on stand-by, for an emergency\".",
      "He said the jihadists also revealed their darkest sides - telling him they captured women during raids on villages and sold them to each other.",
      "\"They trade the women they\u2019ve captured. Others sell wives that they are fed up with. Those who resist are gang-raped into submission by two or three fighters,\" James added, though he did not see them do this.",
      "James said the women at the camp included the wives of jihadists who performed domestic chores like cooking and cleaning, while those who were captured were either sex-slaves or were forced to become fighters.",
      "He explained that he saw fully veiled women, with AK-47 rifles hidden under their clothes, leave the camp to raid villages for livestock to feed people at the camp - or to sell at markets in nearby towns.",
      "James said he also saw dozens of children, including those of jihadists, being trained in the use of weapons and explosives.",
      "\"You'll see a small kid holding a gun and telling you that if he goes to meet some people, this is how he is going to kill them,\" James added.",
      "He said he twice saw four children being taken to another location, before returning to the camp with suicide vests.",
      "They wore long, loose outfits over them, and left the camp with begging bowls, James said.",
      "Jihadists told him that when they anticipate a tough battle in a town or military camp, they send children disguised as beggars who then blow themselves up, so the fighters can enter amid the chaos, James said.",
      "He added that three jihadists had told him that they \"sacrifice their children as suicide bombers and they get paid after every mission\", though they did not disclose the amount.",
      "He said the jihadists tried to indoctrinate him, preaching that \"anything Western is evil\" and showing him propaganda videos every night, including one of the US invasion of Iraq and the killing of Palestinians in the current conflict with Israel.",
      "According to James, as the insurgency was being waged in French-speaking countries, all the jihadists were Francophone, but one spoke English with a Ghanaian accent, and always kept his face covered so that he could not see him.",
      "In a sign that the jihadists were also influenced by pan-Africanism, James said some of them invoked the names of revolutionaries like Burkina Faso's Thomas Sankara and Ghana's Kwame Nkrumah and told him that people should \"rise up\" against \"bad leaders\" and free themselves from \"bondage\".",
      "James said the jihadists also expressed the view that if Sankara and Nkrumah had \"lived long\",  then \"the whole of Africa would have been a better place - nobody would have travelled from Africa to the West. People would have been travelling from the West to Africa\".",
      "James, unemployed at the time, said their rhetoric was powerful, and only \"strength of heart\" prevented him from joining their ranks.",
      "On how exactly he was captured, James said that two Muslim friends were travelling with him at the time, promising to introduce him to a Muslim spiritual leader in Senegal who could pray for him and improve his fortunes.",
      "All three of them were intercepted by the jihadists as they were coming to the end of the first leg of their trip, he said.",
      "James added one of his friends was shot dead as he attempted to flee, while his other friend was taken with him to the camp.",
      "James said the commander did not release his friend, making him fear that he had been forced to join the jihadists - or was dead.",
      "\"The commander told me that: 'I will let you go if you assure me you will get me more fighters',\" James said.",
      "He added that before driving him to a bus rank and giving him the fare for the trip back home, the insurgents gave him a contact number to keep in touch, but, James said, he never did and changed his number.",
      "According to James, the jihadists also gave him charms, which supposedly had supernatural powers.",
      "Again, many other jihadists reject the use of amulets, believing them to be contrary to the teachings of Islam.",
      "James showed the BBC the amulets, which were made of fowl feathers, animal skins and herbs, covered in leather and cloth.",
      "They included one which the jihadists falsely told him offered protection from bullets.",

    "story": [
      "Sipping a glass of local wine is likely not what springs to mind when visiting Scandinavia, but this colder, northerly region is emerging as a new wine frontier.",
      "Hundreds of commercial vineyards are now dotted across Denmark, Sweden, and even Norway, as a first generation of professional winemakers transform what was once a niche hobby into a small but flourishing industry.",
      "Far north of France's Bordeaux or California's Napa Valley, more than 10,000 vines grow on a hillside on Zealand, Denmark's biggest island.",
      "\"People have found out that it is actually possible to grow wine in Denmark, so newcomers are coming, year after year,\" says Nina Fink, as she shows the BBC her three-hectare (seven-acre) winery, Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd.",
      "Nina and her husband Niels started their operation 13 years ago, after retiring from business jobs in Copenhagen. They grow predominantly green grapes, producing floral white wines, as well as sparkling and ros\u00e9.",
      "\"We have longer summer days with more sunlight than you have in France or in Italy, so the conditions are different,\" she explains.",
      "For most Scandinavian vineyards, solaris is the grape of choice - an aromatic, hybrid variety that's well-adapted to colder climes, ripens easily, and is more disease resistant, allowing vineyards to avoid spraying pesticides.",
      "The grape was first bred in Germany in 1975, but only adopted in Scandinavia from 2004, after which winemaking took off.",
      "Niels Fink says that people are positively surprised when they taste the wines from Vejrh\u00f8j Ving\u00e5rd. \"There's a little twinkle in their eye, then comes this half smile,\" he chuckles. \"People like it.\"",
      "The Finks sell their bottles direct from the winery, but they also supply some of Copenhagen's top restaurants, including the three Michelin star Geranium.",
      "Initially they made just 4,000 bottles annually, but now they sell 20,000. \"We are limited by the supply we are able to offer,\" says Mr Fink.",
      "Commercial vineyards in Denmark and Sweden have only been allowed under European Union rules since 2000. Winemaking picked up around 2010, seeing a shift from amateur growers to more ambitious production.",
      "Curiosity, and the fact \"it's possible\", has attracted wine entrepreneurs, explains Jean Becker, from the Danish Wine Association.",
      "\"I was one of the ones that started in the year 2000. We were six growers,\" says Mr Becker, standing in his vineyard 25km (15 miles) north of Copenhagen.",
      "There are now 150 commercial wineries in Denmark with a combined 125 hectares of vines, plus more than 1,000 hobby growers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sweden has 47 commercial operators spanning 193 hectares, according to the Swedish Wine Association, and the biggest has 125,000 vines.",
      "\"I began with 500 vines,\" said Jean Becker, \"Today, new winegrowers are starting with 15,000-25,000. They start bigger in scale. Is there a market for it? The answer is yes.\"",
      "But it's an industry still in its infancy, compared to the 800,000 hectares cultivated in France, and almost a million hectares in Spain.",
      "In southern Zealand, Jesper Rye Jensen, who runs Vesterhave Vingaard, produces red wines from varieties like pinot noir and merlot, usually associated with France.",
      "\"It is very challenging because it's new for us,\" he says. \"We have to learn it. It's not like southern Europe, where they had generation after generation.\"",
      "Data shows that both Denmark and Sweden have seen average temperatures rise almost two degrees celsius over the past 40-50 years, resulting in milder winters and a longer fruit-growing season. But there remains a risk of frost damage.",
      "Jesper Rye Jensen says that as a northerly wine producer climate change works in his favour. \"We wine growers in Denmark are happy that we are getting a little bit better weather.\"",
      "But Niels Fink reckons that the warming climate is a double-edged sword. \"Climate change is accompanied by all kinds of evils, such as more extreme weather phenomena, long drought, heavy rain. That is as threatening here as it is elsewhere.\"",
      "However, Prof Torben Bo Toldam-Andersen, a fruit science researcher from the University of Copenhagen, says that rather than a longer growing season, it is the emergence of new, hardier grapes that largely kick-started the rise of Scandinavian wineries. \"Climate change makes it easier for sure, but the main driver is the new cultivars.\"",
      "He is leading a programme called \"FastGrapes\", which tests varieties of vines, to find the most robust and best suited to northern Europe.",
      "They are selected according to how quickly their grapes ripen, and their resilience to pests, disease, and other environmental stresses. New seedlings can then be grown on a higher scale.",
      "\"There are so many things that go into the perfect wine,\" says the researcher. \"Part of that search happens in the lab\u2026 you can see the genes that make it strong.\"",
      "The first chosen vines are now growing in 15 test locations, across Scandinavia, Lithuania, northern Germany and Belgium.",
      "But even with the best possible grape varieties and warmer weather, Scandinavian wineries face numerous challenges, such as high labour costs and strict rules on the use of chemical treatments to tackle any disease in the vineyards.",
      "Romain Chichery says it can also be difficult for wineries to find workers. Born and raised in France, he moved to Sweden shortly after completing his studies in winemaking and viticulture.",
      "Now 27, the winemaker works at Thora Vineyard on the country's southwestern Bj\u00e4re peninsula. \"We need to train workers, or we have to bring them from outside [the country],\" he says.",
      "But ''starting from scratch\" in Sweden, he adds that he enjoys the freedom to experiment. \"It's not just copy paste, which has been done for decades, or centuries, in the older viticulture world.\"",
      "Thora's owner, American expat Heather \u00d6berg says all the effort and expense is worth it. \"We can compete with other European wines,\" she says.",
      "Yet, home-grown Scandinavian wine currently makes up just a fraction of the consumer market, and bottles are expensive. Danish wine in Denmark costs from 200 kroner ($27; \u00a322) a bottle upwards, more than twice the price of the cheapest French and Spain imports. Only a negligible amount is exported.",
      "\"We will never get in competition with France, Italy and Spain because they have very low prices,\" says Mr Becker.",
      "At his central Copenhagen wine shop, Vino Fino, owner Nicolai Christiansen mostly sells French wine. Yet he says he has recently sold a case of Danish wine to a bar owner in France.",
      "\"If you can sell it to a French guy, you can probably sell it to everybody,\" he jokes.",
      "However, he is still to be convinced about Danish wine. \"The Danish wine is still too expensive,\" he says. \"It's coming up. but I still think there's some way to go before the quality is there.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 00:10:32 GMT",
    "summary": "India, the world's most populous country, is seeing a debate about having more babies.",
    "story": [
      "Last year, India nudged past China to become the world's most populous country, according to UN estimates.",
      "With nearly 1.45 billion people now, you'd think the country would be quiet about having more children. But guess what? The chatter has suddenly picked up.",
      "Leaders of two southern states \u2013 Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu \u2013 have recently advocated more children.",
      "Andhra Pradesh is mulling providing incentives, citing low fertility rates and ageing population. The state also scrapped its \"two-child policy\" for local body elections, and reports say neighbouring Telangana may soon do the same. Next-door Tamil Nadu is also making similar, more exaggerated, noises.",
      "India's fertility rate has fallen substantially - from 5.7 births per woman in 1950 to the current rate of two.",
      "Fertility rates have fallen below the replacement level of two births per woman in 17 of the 29 states and territories. (A replacement level is one at which new births are sufficient to maintain a stable population.)",
      "The five southern Indian states lead India's demographic transition, achieving replacement-level fertility well ahead of others. Kerala reached the milestone in 1988, Tamil Nadu in 1993, and the rest by the mid-2000s.",
      "Today, the five southern states have total fertility rates below 1.6, with Karnataka at 1.6 and Tamil Nadu at 1.4. In other words, fertility rates in these states match or are less than many European countries.",
      "But these states fear that India's shifting demographics with varying population shares between states, will significantly impact electoral representation and state wise-allocation of parliamentary seats and federal revenues.",
      "\"They fear being penalised for their effective population control policies, despite being better economic performers and contributing significantly to federal revenues,\" Srinivas Goli, a professor of demography at the International Institute for Population Sciences, told the BBC.",
      "Southern states are also grappling with another major concern as India prepares for its first delimitation of electoral seats in 2026 - the first since 1976.",
      "This exercise will redraw electoral boundaries to reflect population shifts, likely reducing parliamentary seats for the economically prosperous southern states. As federal revenues are allocated based on state populations, many fear this could deepen their financial struggles and limit policy-making freedom.",
      "Demographers KS James and Shubhra Kriti project that populous northern states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar stand to gain more seats from delimitation, while southern states such as Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh could face losses, further shifting political representation.",
      "Many, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, have hinted that changes to fiscal shares and parliamentary seat allocations will not be rushed through.",
      "\"As a demographer, I don't think states should be overly concerned about these issues. They can be resolved through constructive negotiations between federal and state governments,\" says Mr Goli. \"My concern lies elsewhere.\"",
      "The key challenge, according to demographers, is India's rapid ageing driven by declining fertility rates. While countries like France and Sweden took 120 and 80 years respectively to double their aging population from 7% to 14%, India is expected to reach this milestone in just 28 years, says Mr Goli.",
      "This accelerated ageing is tied to India's unique success in fertility decline. In most countries, improved living standards, education, and urbanisation naturally lower fertility as child survival improves.",
      "But in India, fertility rates fell rapidly despite modest socio-economic progress, thanks to aggressive family welfare programmes that promoted small families through targets, incentives, and disincentives.",
      "The unintended consequence? Take Andhra Pradesh, for instance. Its fertility rate is 1.5, on par with Sweden, but its per capita income is 28 times lower, says Mr Goli. With mounting debt and limited resources, can states like these support higher pensions or social security for a rapidly aging population?",
      "Consider this. More than 40% of elderly Indians (60+ years) belong to the poorest wealth quintile - the bottom 20% of a population in terms of wealth distribution, according to United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)'s latest India Ageing Report.",
      "In other words, Mr Goli says, \"India is getting old before getting rich\".",
      "Fewer children also mean a rising old-age dependency ratio, leaving fewer caregivers for an expanding elderly demographic. Demographers warn that India's healthcare, community centres and old-age homes are unprepared for this shift.",
      "Urbanisation, migration, and changing labour markets are further eroding traditional family support - India's strong point - leaving more elderly people behind.",
      "While migration from populous to less populous states can ease the working-age gap, it also sparks anti-migration anxieties. \"Robust investments in prevention, palliative care, and social infrastructure are urgently needed to look after the ageing,\" says  Mr Goli.",
      "As if the southern states' concerns weren't enough, earlier this month, the chief of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Volunteers' Organisation), the ideological backbone of Mr Modi's BJP -  urged couples to have at least three children to secure India's future. \"According to population science, when growth falls below 2.1, a society perishes on its own. Nobody destroys it,\" Mohan Bhagwat reportedly said at a recent meeting.",
      "While Mr Bhagwat's concerns may have some basis, they are not entirely accurate, say demographers. Tim Dyson, a demographer at the London School of Economics, told the BBC that after a decade or two, continuing \"very low levels of fertility will lead to rapid population decline\".",
      "A fertility rate of 1.8 births per woman leads to a slow, manageable population decline. But a rate of 1.6 or lower could trigger \"rapid, unmanageable population decline\".",
      "\"Smaller numbers of people will enter the reproductive - and main working - ages, and this will be socially, politically and economically disastrous. This is a demographic process and it is extremely difficult to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson.",
      "This is already happening in some countries.",
      "In May, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared the country's record-low birth rate a \"national emergency\" and announced plans for a dedicated government ministry. Greece's fertility rate has plummeted to 1.3, half of what it was in 1950, sparking warnings from Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis about an \"existential\" population threat.",
      "But demographers say that urging people to have more children is futile. \"Considering the societal shifts, including the significant reduction in gender disparities as women's lives have become increasingly similar to those of men, this trend is unlikely to reverse,\" says Mr Dyson.",
      "WATCH: Why do some in India want couples to have more children?",
      "For Indian states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala, grappling with a declining workforce, the key question is: who will step in to fill the gap? Developed countries, unable to reverse declining fertility, are focusing on healthy and active ageing - prolonging working life by five to seven years and enhancing productivity in older populations.",
      "Demographers say India will need to extend retirement ages meaningfully, and policies must prioritise increasing healthy years through better health screenings, and stronger social security to ensure an active and productive older population - a potential \"silver dividend\".",
      "India must also leverage its demographic dividend better - economic growth that occurs when a country has a large, working-age population. Mr Goli believes there's a window of opportunity until 2047 to boost the economy, create jobs for the working-age population, and allocate resources for the ageing. \"We're only reaping 15-20% of the dividend - we can do much better,\" he says.",

      "But traditional burials can pollute too. Non-biodegradable coffins are often made with harmful chemicals and bodies are embalmed using formaldehyde: a toxic substance which can leach into soil.",
      "In a recent survey from Co-op Funeralcare, conducted by YouGov, one person in 10 said they would want a more 'eco-friendly' funeral.",
      "Rachel, from Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, made a burial shroud for a friend from locally-sourced wool, willow, bramble and ivy, as part of her work as an artist.",
      "For years she has explored the themes of death, dying, grief and nature through crafts and functional objects.",
      "But the 50-year-old sees the shroud, which can also remove the need for a coffin, as more than just artwork - and has since decided to make her own.",
      "A common reaction from those who have seen the creation is to ask if they can touch it, to feel how soft it is.",
      "For Rachel, it is the perfect way of helping people address the taboo topic of death.",
      "She also works as a death doula, which involves supporting people who are dying, as well as their loved ones, to make informed funeral care choices.",
      "\"I find that when we talk about death, everybody I've met finds it a helpful and healthy thing, and something that is life-enriching,\" she says.",
      "\u201cWhen somebody dies it is often so shocking. We just get on a treadmill of \u2018this is what happens\u2019, so I want to open up those conversations.",

      "When Rachel's time comes, she wants a natural burial, which means using a biodegradable coffin or shroud in a shallower grave. The upper layers of soil contain more active microbes, so bodies can decompose in about 20 to 30 years, rather than up to 100 in a traditional grave.",
      "Natural burial grounds are dotted across the UK and bear little resemblance to normal cemeteries \u2013 trees and wildflowers replace man-made grave markings, and no pesticides are used.",
      "Embalming, headstones, ornaments, and plastic flowers are not allowed.",

      "\u201cMore and more people are asking about it and want to make choices that are better for the planet. They often feel it reflects the life of the person who has died because it was important to them,\" she says.",
      "As with many eco-friendly industries, natural burials can cost more. Many grounds, including Tarn Moor, offer cheaper plots to locals. One in Speeton, North Yorkshire, is community-run and puts profits back into the village playground.",
      "At Tarn Moor, a plot plus maintenance for Skipton residents costs \u00a31,177. Non-locals are charged \u00a31,818. The nearest council cemetery charges \u00a31,200 for a grave while cremation costs here start at \u00a3896.",

      "Guards would come in and call names of people who would be led away and never seen again.",
      "\"People wouldn't be executed in front of us. Every time they would call names at 12am, we knew that those people were going to be killed,\" Adnan says.",

      "In some of the cells, inmates would pool all of the food together. But it wasn't enough.",
      "Adnan found the hunger even harder than the beatings. \"I would go to sleep and wake up hungry,\" he says.",
      "\"There was a punishment that we received one month where one day they would pass us a slice of bread, the next day half a slice, until it was a tiny crumb. Then it was nothing. We got no bread.\"",
      "Qasem says one day guards covered the face of his cell's de-facto leader with yoghurt and made others lick it off.",
      "The men said the behaviour of guards was as much about inflicting humiliation as pain.",
      "All described losing significant amounts of weight in the prison because of malnourishment.",
      "\"My biggest dream was to eat and be full,\" Qasem says.",
      "His family paid officers bribes for visitation rights. He would sometimes be brought down on a wheelchair because he was too weak to walk, his father says.",
      "Diseases were rife and the inmates had no way of stopping them from spreading.",
      "Two of the men we spoke to who were released on Sunday say they had contracted tuberculosis in Saydnaya - one said medication was frequently withheld as a form of punishment.",
      "But Adnan says the \"diseases from fear\" were even worse than the physical ones.",
      "At a hospital in Damascus this week, an official said brief medical checks of the detainees that were sent there had found \"mainly psychological problems\".",
      "These accounts paint a picture of a place with no hope, only pain.",
      "The prisoners spent much of their time in silence with no access to the outside world, so it is no surprise that they say they knew nothing of the rebel Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's (HTS) rapid advance in Syria until they were broken free that morning.",
      "Qasem said they could hear what sounded like a helicopter taking off from the prison grounds before the men's shouts in the corridors. But in the windowless cell they couldn't be sure.",
      "Then the doors opened, and the freed inmates began running as fast as they could.",
      "\"We ran out of the prison. We ran from fear too,\" Rakan says, his thoughts on his young children and wife.",

      "He says he will never go back to Saydnaya again.",
      "Adnan, too, says he couldn't look back at the prison, as he ran crying towards Damascus.",
      "\"I just kept going. I can't describe it. I just headed for Damascus. People were taking us from the road in their cars.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 22:33:31 GMT",
    "summary": "As Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.",
    "story": [
      "As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US.",
      "Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years.",
      "Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation.",
      "That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can \"make Argentina great again\".",
      "Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is \"experiencing a giant improvement\" under his leadership.",
      "But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed?",
      "Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires.",
      "In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half.",
      "Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008.",
      "All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department.",
      "Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely.",
      "Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (\u00a31.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing \"a fantastic job\" in Argentina by \"deleting entire departments\" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing.",
      "But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical.",
      "Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that \"taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense\".",
      "\"The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was \"bursting into crisis every few years\".",
      "\"That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else.\"",
      "Marcelo J Garc\u00eda, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a \"masterpiece\" of political marketing that has \"captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe\".",
      "But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants.",
      "\"I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He points out that Trump's policies \"require big government in some areas\", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. \"You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government.\"",
      "In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government.",
      "Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the \"woke agenda\". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different.",
      "Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay.",
      "While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur \"has ended up becoming a prison\".",
      "\"If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?\" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed.",
      "Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's.",
      "Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs.",
      "He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US.",
      "Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: \"You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise.\"",
      "The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population.",
      "As Marcelo J Garc\u00eda sees it, Milei is a \"divisive leader\" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents.",
      "\"The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,\" he says.",
      "\"Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,\" he adds.",
      "In his view, this is a real weakness: \"You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you.\"",
      "Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."

      "The loss of identity can be one of the causes of postnatal depression, which disproportionately affects black women. Though she did not recognise it at the time, this was what Dola was suffering from.",
      "Once out of hospital, she was almost immediately being bombarded with unsolicited advice.",
      "There was \u201ctoo much talk, too much control around how I should raise the child. In a way that also affected my mind. It made me feel like I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. I wasn\u2019t given the chance to be a mother.\u201d",

      "She then made a middle-of-the-night call to her health visitor who, fortunately, picked up and agreed to come round.",
      "\u201cI buried my head in shame, I just felt so much shame because it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even a good mother. I don\u2019t have the strength to be a mother.\u201d",

      "Learning the craft in Nigeria, while studying for a marine biology degree, she stood out from the crowd with her dyed-gold hair and pink boots.",
      "Dola began to build a reputation in Lagos\u2019s male-dominated worlds of fashion and celebrity photography. But she gravitated towards portraiture as it allowed her to document people\u2019s lives and encouraged subjects to share something more profound.",
      "For the therapy she turned the lens on herself \u2013 and, using an app on her phone to remotely control the camera, began to produce a portfolio of shots of her with Monioluwa.",
      "The mother-and-baby portrait, drawing on representations of the Madonna and child, is one of the fundamental motifs of the Western art tradition.",
      "Dola\u2019s photographs fit into this mode but the connection was unconscious at first and it took a mentor to point it out.",
      "She was raised in a religious household - her father was a bishop in a Nigerian church. Paintings of Mary and Jesus were on the walls of her home, and the image of the mother and child was in the Bibles and hymn books.",
      "\u201cThe colours: the green, red and gold; the gold frames and the light glow \u2013 growing up in that environment, it was all there in my subconscious.\u201d",

      "An investigation by Swedish news outlet Aftonbladet reported that 11 current and former employees described being belittled, called names and yelled at in the workplace.",
      "Ms Djerf, 27, told the BBC she was \"deeply sorry\" to anyone who has felt mistreated under her leadership.",
      "But customers like 22-year-old Sumi Mrkulic have vowed to \"never purchase anything or voice support again\".",
      "'Performative and spineless'",
      "Sumi, from London, said she was particularly concerned after Aftonbladet reported that some models were told they didn't fill out a pair of jeans, while others were called fat.",
      "Djerf Avenue's website promotes a world \"filled with kindness, inspiration, and respect,\" and the brand is known for its size inclusivity and diverse model representation.",
      "Sumi told the BBC: \"It renders all of their efforts to be inclusive completely performative. I actually find it really spineless.\"",
      "Influencer Matilda Djerf launched the brand in 2019 and it quickly became popular with young women. It says it made around $35m (\u00a327.5m) in revenue last year.",
      "It recently held its first 10-day pop-up shop in London, which saw queues forming up to three hours before the store opened.",
      "'Betrayal of values'",
      "Giulia Carrozzo, 20, from Germany, received an order from Djerf Avenue the day before the allegations emerged. She said she would be sending it back in light of the report.",
      "\"Djerf Avenue has always marketed itself as a body-positive, inclusive and empowering brand, so hearing allegations of body-shaming and a toxic work environment felt like a complete betrayal of the values they claim to uphold,\" she said.",
      "\"I knew immediately that this wasn't something I could support.\"",
      "Matilda Djerf, who started her online career in 2016, was recognised for her work within retail and e-commerce on the Forbes 30 under 30 list in 2023.",
      "Giulia said: \"To me, supporting a brand led by a woman felt like celebrating progress and uplifting women in business. However, these allegations... directly contradict those values.",
      "\"I can't justify supporting a brand that doesn't practise the values it promotes. Until there's real accountability and change, I won't be purchasing from them.\"",
      "'Take criticism very seriously'",
      "Matilda Djerf said in a statement: \"If any team member has felt mistreated in their role because of my actions, I am deeply sorry, and I want to sincerely apologize.",
      "\"I don't recognize myself in all the claims that have been made, and I've chosen not to comment on individual cases. However, I do believe it's valuable that these concerns are being raised, as it gives both me and Djerf Avenue the opportunity to grow and improve.",
      "\"I want to emphasize that I take full responsibility and see this as a chance to reflect, grow, and contribute to a better culture for everyone at Djerf Avenue.\"",
      "Djerf Avenue's chief operating officer, Pernilla Bonny, said the company acknowledged the challenges in its workplace environment and had taken steps to address them.",
      "These actions include conducting monthly anonymous employee surveys, implementing an independent whistleblower function, strengthening the management team and carrying out an independent workplace assessment with an external psychologist."

      "Just a few days after UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was murdered on a New York City sidewalk, these young men had lined up in Washington Square Park to compete in a lookalike contest for the man wanted for his murder.",
      "It was sparsely attended and seen as a joke by those who did turn up, said Talia Jane, a journalist who was there.",
      "But it underlined an obsession with a murder suspect that has gripped social media since the killing on 4 December, fuelled by latent anger directed at America's private health insurers.",
      "\"There was a lot of tinder already there, a lot of discontent, a lot of frustration already there, and [this] sort of threw a match on it,\" Ms Jane said.",

      "In TikTok videos, memes and group chats, a young man accused of shooting a father-of-two in the back on a New York City sidewalk has been fawned over and praised as a kind of folk hero.",
      "This fetishisation was remarkably widespread, not limited to radical corners of the internet or any political affiliation, troubling many observers.",
      "\"We do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,\" said Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, where Mr Mangione was arrested at a McDonald's.",
      "\"In a civil society, we are all less safe when ideologues engage in vigilante justice.\"",
      "Almost immediately after Mr Thompson was shot dead, the internet began to lionise his suspected killer. On TikTok, people posted videos of a \"CEO assassin\" New York City walking tour. On Spotify, playlists dedicated to the suspect started to appear.",
      "Once Mr Mangione was arrested, these fans came to his defence.",
      "The start of his legal battles prompted anonymous donors to chip in thousands of dollars towards his defence through various online fundraisers.",
      "Etsy was flooded with pro-Mangione apparel, while Amazon pulled similar products from their site.",
      "The McDonald's worker alleged to have turned him in has become a target for online hate, while the fast-food franchise itself has been spammed with bad reviews.",
      "The police department in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that arrested him even received death threats.",
      "Much of this online reaction has focused on his looks, with the internet dubbing him the \"hot assassin\".",
      "Indeed, Mr Mangione's appearance, which he showed off in shirtless social media posts, is now clearly part of the appeal, said cultural critic Blakely Thornton.",
      "Americans are effectively \"programmed\" to trust and empathise with men who look like Mr Mangione, he said.",
      "\"That's why they are the protagonists in our movies, books and stories.\"",

      "The internet has caused \"a blurring of the lines between celebrity and criminality\", she told the BBC, adding that when people see a good-looking person pop into their feeds, their first thought is lust, not moral criticism.",
      "\"The mood around Luigi Mangione is 'thirst',\" she said.",
      "Beyond his appearance, a large part of Mr Mangione's online appeal is clearly his apparent ire against the private healthcare industry and corporate elites in general. US media has reported that Mr Mangione was arrested carrying a handwritten document that said \"these parasites had it coming\".",
      "The Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a non-profit extremism research group based in New Jersey, said that after the shooting the hashtag #EatTheRich went viral.",
      "Since Mr Mangione's arrest, variations of \"#FreeLuigi\" were posted on X over 50,000 times, likely getting tens of millions of impressions. And by some measures, the NCRI said, engagement with posts about Mr Thompson's killing across platforms like X, Reddit, and others surpassed that of the assassination attempt against Donald Trump in July.",
      "An analysis of a sample of comments carried out by market research firm OneCliq found the vast majority - four-fifths - contained criticism of the healthcare system.",
      "Mr Mangione's X account has gained more than 400,000 followers since the shooting.",
      "The shooting also seemed to inspire others to take action against healthcare insurers - \"wanted\" posters of other CEOs appeared around New York City, and a woman in Florida was arrested after telling an insurance agent on the phone \"Delay, Deny, Depose. You people are next,\" alluding to the words inscribed on bullet casings found at the murder scene.",
      "Alex Goldenberg, a senior adviser at the NCRI, called the online reaction a \"turning point\" and \"a catalyst for the normalisation of political violence that was once confined to extremists on the fringes\".",
      "He compared the wave of comments to the online activity following racist mass murders, designed to defend the killers and signal-boost their beliefs - only more widespread, and happening across mainstream social media networks.",
      "\"The dynamic we are observing is eerily similar to the activity on platforms like 4chan, 8chan, Discord, and in other dark corners of the internet, where mass shootings are often met with glee,\" he said.",
      "Tim Weninger, a computer science professor at Notre Dame and expert in social media and artificial intelligence, said evidence suggests that the groundswell was authentic - not powered by bots or government influence operations.",
      "\"People are pissed off at the healthcare industry and they are using social media to express their frustrations,\" he said. \"They're expressing those frustrations by supporting this suspect.\"",
      "Recent research by Commonwealth Fund, a health policy institute, found 45% of insured working-age adults were charged for something they thought should have been free or covered by insurance, and 17% of respondents said their insurer denied coverage for care that was recommended by their doctor.",
      "There are indications that the shooting has prompted some introspection on the part of healthcare companies.",
      "\"I think all of us are taking a step back and trying to understand what's happening with patients and their experiences,\" Pfizer's chief sustainability officer Caroline Roan told a conference in New York on Wednesday, according to Reuters.",
      "Some of the people who have been protesting against health insurance companies for years, before online criticism about UHC took off, understand some of the darker sentiments, even if they don't endorse them.",
      "\"It's a horrific act of violence, and I absolutely condemn it no matter the motivation,\" Jenn Coffey, who has been fighting to get UHC to cover her medical bills, said of Mr Thompson's killing. \"But I'm not shocked by the reaction.\"",

      "How Luigi Mangione's legal defence could take shape",
      "Ms Coffey, 53, from Manchester, New Hampshire, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2013 and later fell ill with complex regional pain syndrome, a potentially debilitating neurological condition. When a doctor suggested that she try ketamine therapy, her UHC insurance would not cover the procedure, she said. She has since become involved in a protest campaign organised by activist group People's Action.",
      "Ms Coffey's illness forced her to stop working as an emergency medical technician. She said she started a crowdfunding drive and had to sell most of her belongings in order to pay for the treatment herself.",
      "\"I get to have some normality. I can sit up and paint, or I can enjoy a meal with my family\" because of the treatment, she said. \"I can have a life that's worth living.\"",
      "UnitedHealth Group told the BBC they could not comment on individual cases for privacy reasons.",
      "At the same time, much of the online discussion has effectively ignored the victim, Brian Thompson, who was 50.",
      "\"It's incredibly bleak that [Thompson's death] hasn't been covered as much because, bottom line, a person died, a person was murdered,\" Blakely Thornton said.",
      "\"The collective rage over [the healthcare industry] is really outweighing what is still a tragedy.\"",
      "In his last post on LinkedIn, Mr Thompson talked about efforts to make healthcare more affordable - and was criticised in the comments. CBS News, the BBC's US partner, obtained a message that UnitedHealth CEO Andrew Witty sent to staff this week, memorialising Mr Thompson and calling his murdered colleague \"one of the good guys\".",
      "\"He was certainly one of the smartest guys. I think he was one of the best guys. I'm going to miss him. And I am incredibly proud to call him my friend,\" he wrote.",
      "In the email, the company shared messages from customers, including one who wrote about recovering from cancer, saying their treatment was paid for by the insurance company's benefits.",
      "\"I'm thankful to UHC and everyone there who works within a broken system to help as many people as they can,\" they wrote, according to the company.",
      "Another message said: \"So very sad that this world is so hateful. I have always had great experiences with UHC.\"",
      "Ms Coffey, the UHC policyholder and patient, said: \"My heart goes out to the family and I can't imagine what they're having to struggle with that [killing]. It's awful to me that this is the catalyst for this debate.\"",

      "Since the fall of Barnier a week ago - after a vote of no confidence supported by left and populist right - Macron has consulted with a range of leaders in the hope of forming a new informal coalition to run the country.",
      "Barnier having been a man of the traditional right, Macron's first instinct was to turn to the traditional left - and efforts initially focused on prising the Socialist Party (PS) from its alliance with the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI).",
      "However as the PS's condition was the adoption of leftwing policies that Macron was unwilling to sanction,  he was forced to limit his search to his own inner circle.",
      "Bayrou has been a close ally of the president since before Macron's first stunning election win in 2017. Indeed Bayrou's decision to stand aside as a candidate that year - and rally behind the younger man - created a vital dynamic behind Macron's campaign.",
      "A well-known figure on the political stage for more than 40 years,  Bayrou - who is 73 - has run the Modem party, which now has 36 deputies, since its formation in 2007. Before that he was the leader of other centrist incarnations.",
      "His beginnings were in the Chistian Democrat tradition of post-war politics, which in general supported but kept a distance from the larger Gaullist component of the French right, led from the late 1970s by Jacques Chirac.",
      "Bayrou, who was a teacher of classical languages in his 20s, served as education minister from 1993 to 1997. But that was his last meaningful experience of government.",
      "Very briefly in 2017 he was Macron's justice minister, but stepped down after being accused in a party funding scandal.",
      "He was eventually cleared of wrongdoing, but many of his colleagues were convicted. And prosecutors have appealed against his acquittal, meaning he could yet be brought back to court.",
      "An observant Catholic with six children, Bayrou's political base is in the Pyrenean city of Pau where he has been mayor since 2014. He speaks the local Bearnese language and is a strong believer in decentralisation.",
      "Bayrou has run for the presidency three times, as standard-bearer of the centre. He was closest to victory in 2007, when he came third with nearly 19% of the vote. He then angered the future winner Nicolas Sarkozy by coming out in support of the Socialist candidate S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal.",
      "When the only possible means of survival for a minority government is to build bridges on left and right, Bayrou has the advantage of having passable relations with both sides.",
      "His backing for Royal and then Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in 2012 has established a certain trust among the Socialists. But his views on debt - and the need to bring it down - help him on the right.",
      "Interestingly his relationship with Marine Le Pen of the populist right is also respectful. In the past he has helped her collect the sponsorships needed to run for the presidency, arguing that it would be an affront to democracy if the leader of the most popular party could not stand.",
      "Similar sentiments led to support for Le Pen, when the prosecutor in her own party funding trial (a similar case to his own) recently demanded she be declared ineligible for public office.",
      "This may mean that Bayrou can avoid an automatic censure from the populist right.",
      "But Le Pen's National Rally has also warned that if the new prime minister is \"Barnier with another face\" it will not hesitate to bring him down.",

      "\"He will not be easily disciplined,\" said Duhamel. \"And he will tilt policy more towards the left.\"",
      "France's crisis of government - the most serious in the Fifth Republic - has led to a major shift in power, away from the Elys\u00e9e and towards the prime minister and parliament.",

      "\"Today again, power rests with the groups in parliament who may or may not come together on certain shared policies.\"",
      "Bayrou's first task will be to name a new government, which could take many days. The composition will be an indication of whether he has managed to build bridges to the Socialists on one side, and Barnier's conservatives on the other.",
      "But very quickly he will have to draw up a new 2025 budget to replace the one abandoned by the Barnier government; and immediately he will be faced with possible rebellions from the left and far-right.",
      "The idea of some parliamentarians of a kind of non-aggression pact - in which government promises not to push through laws without a vote and MPs promise not to vote a motion of censure - has been backed by Macron, who also said he did not want to dissolve the Assembly again before the end of his term in 2027.",

The aggressive campaign triggered riots in several parts of the country and, according to some estimates, left hundreds dead.",
      "The violence was a painful reminder of the religious strife India had witnessed during partition in 1947.",
      "While introducing the bill in parliament, then home minister SB Chavan expressed anxiety about \"an alarming rise of intolerance propagated by certain sections for their narrow vested interests\".",
      "These groups, he said, were resorting to \"forcible conversion\" of places of worship in an attempt to create new disputes.",
      "The BJP, then in the opposition, strongly opposed the bill, with some lawmakers walking out of parliament. An MP from the party said he believed the bill was brought in to appease the minorities and would only increase the rift between Hindus and Muslims.",
      "Apart from archaeological sites - whether religious or not - the only exception to the law was the Babri Masjid, as a legal challenge against the structure existed even before independence.",
      "Hindu mobs, however, demolished the mosque within months of the enactment of the law. In 2019, while awarding the disputed land to Hindu groups, India's Supreme Court said that the demolition of the mosque was an illegal act.",
      "Why does it keep making news?",
      "The Supreme Court's ruling on the law will be crucial to the fate of dozens of religious structures, especially those of Muslims, that are contested by Hindu groups. These include Gyanvapi and Shahi Eidgah, two disputed mosques in the holy cities of Varanasi and Mathura.",
      "Critics also point out that the historical nature of the sites will make it hard to conclusively establish divergent claims, leaving scope for bitter inter-religious battles and violence.",
      "While the hearing is being closely watched, the law also makes news whenever there is a fresh development in cases challenging mosques.",
      "Two weeks ago, a court in Rajasthan issued notices to the government after admitting a petition claiming that the revered Ajmer Sharif dargah - a 13th-Century Sufi shrine that attracts thousands of visitors every day - stood over a Hindu temple.",
      "And last month, four people were killed in Sambhal town in Uttar Pradesh state when violence broke out during a court-ordered survey of a 16th-Century mosque. Muslim groups have contested the survey in the Supreme Court.",
      "There have been tensions over other court-ordered surveys earlier, including in the case of the Gyanvapi mosque. Hindu groups said the 17th-Century mosque was built by Mughal emperor Aurangzeb on the partial ruins of the Kashi Vishwanath temple. Muslim groups opposed the survey ordered by a local court, saying it violated the 1991 law.",
      "But in 2022, a Supreme Court bench headed by then chief justice DY Chandrachud did not stop the survey from going ahead. He also observed that the 1991 law did not prevent investigations into the status of a place of worship as of 15 August 1947, as long as it did not seek to alter it.",
      "Many have criticised this since then, with former civil servant Harsh Mander saying that it \"opened the floodgates for this series of orders by courts that run contrary to the 1991 law\".",
      "\"If you allow the survey of a mosque to determine if a temple lay below it, but then prohibit actions to restore a temple at that site, this is a surefire recipe for fostering resentment, hate and fear that could detonate for years in bitter feuds between people of diverse faiths,\" Mr Mander wrote.",
      "Thursday's Supreme Court order means that these surveys and ongoing court cases remain on hold for now.",

      "The Pacific nation has produced many stars of Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) and has long been lobbying to join the franchise.",
      "Australia will provide A$600m (\u00a3301m, $384m) over ten years to set up the team \u2013 which will be based in Port Moresby and compete from 2028 \u2013 and help develop the game at a grassroots level across the Pacific region.",
      "In exchange, PNG signed a separate pact which it says reaffirms its commitment to Australia as its major security partner.",
      "The precise terms of the dual deals are confidential, but the BBC understands they allow Australia to withdraw funding if PNG enters a security agreement with a nation outside the so-called \"Pacific family\". That term is widely accepted to exclude China, despite Beijing's efforts to gain a foothold in the region.",
      "If Canberra pulls out, the NRL is then obligated to drop the PNG team.",
      "Announcing the agreement in Sydney on Thursday, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said it was a \"monumental\" opportunity for his country, and one aimed at fostering \"unity\" - not only between the 830 language groups in PNG, but also between the nation at large and its closest neighbour.",
      "\"For us, it's not just sport and sport commerce, it is [about]... uniting the most diverse nation on the face of planet Earth and also uniting PNG-Australia together in ways that matter most, people to people,\" he told reporters.",
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared it was a \"great day\" for both countries, and said PNG - the only country in the world where rugby league is the national sport - \"deserves\" a spot in the league.",
      "\"The new team will belong to the people of Papua New Guinea\u2026 And I know it will have millions of proud fans barracking for it from day one,\" Albanese said.",

      "A name and uniform for the new team will be decided at a later point.",
      "'Unprecedented' win for sport diplomacy",
      "Stuart Murray, an Associate Professor of International Relations, told the BBC that while Australia's use of sport as a diplomatic strategy is nothing new, this agreement is unprecedented.",
      "The country has over the past decade been \"thinking innovatively about how you can marry sport with policy to counter classical security threats\" said Dr Murray, from Bond University.",
      "In this case, he added, \"the scale, the size, the scope and the funding, and the fact that it's being endorsed at such a high level with both prime ministers - that's never been done before\".",
      "\"Basically, through this one channel, we will open up 20 or 30 other channels - for business, trade, policing, educational exchange, gender work, climate change... I think it is fantastic.\"",
      "Australia and China have each been vying for greater influence in the Pacific in recent years. After Beijing inked a major policing deal with the Solomon Islands in 2022, Australia has spent years  trying to forge exclusive security pacts with countries across the region \u2013 including a policing agreement with Tuvalu last year, and a treaty with Nauru unveiled earlier this week.",

      "Both prime ministers have sought to downplay the security aspect of the deals, framing them instead as a boon to what Mr Nobetau says has been a \"thinning\" relationship between the two countries.",
      "Marape made a point to say the agreement \"doesn't stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbours\".",
      "\"We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner,\" he said. \"But in security, closer to home\u2026 our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed\u2026 together.\"",
      "Government sources say the deals do not give Australia veto power over PNG security agreements. But their framing does have the effect of eliminating almost every other potential partner - and Mr Nobetau said the announcement could be seen by some in PNG as \"an exertion of Australian power over PNG sovereignty\".",
      "Both he and Dr Murray also note, however, that the dual deals speak to an emerging \"transactional\" dynamic in Pacific relations.",
      "\"People that talk about goodwill and who say sport and politics don't mix, that's the 20th century view,\" Dr Murray said. \"For us, there's no way we're going to give away one of our prize cultural assets for nothing. That doesn't happen in diplomacy.\"",
      "Dr Murray and Mr Nobetau also both agree that the deals mark a significant moment in bilateral relations between the two countries - and are a likely indicator of how Australia is going to continue to pursue its agenda across the region.",
      "\"China puts in a lot of money into sport infrastructure\u2026 which is sort of what China is good at\u2026 [but] China is not going to be offering any alternatives in this space,\" Mr Nobetau said.",
      "\"It's something that other countries can't do,\" Dr Murray added. \"We need to use it, especially in a very, very contested region such as the Pacific.\""

    "summary": "John Mahama was elected on his pledges to solve the economic crisis but won't find it easy, analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Ghana's former President John Mahama will be under enormous pressure to meet the expectations of voters following his landslide victory in Saturday's election.",
      "He swept back to power after eight years in opposition, running what political analyst Nansata Yakubu described as a \"masterclass\" in campaigning.",
      "He defeated Vice-President Mahamudu Bawumia by 56.6% of votes to 41.6% to notch up the biggest margin of victory by a candidate in 24 years.",
      "But voter turnout was lower than in the 2020 election, especially in some of the heartlands of Bwaumia's New Patriotic Party (NPP), suggesting some people there - disillusioned with its performance in government - stayed at home.",
      "As Mahama's supporters celebrated his victory, Belinda Amuzu - a teacher in the northern city of Tamale, a stronghold of Mahama - summed up their hopes.",
      "\"I'm expecting the new government to change the economy, so that the hardship will come down. He should also prosecute corrupt officials so that it will be a lesson to others,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"The hardship\" has become a common phrase in Ghana since the economy hit rock-bottom in 2022, causing a cost-of-living crisis that shredded Bawumia's reputation as an \"economic whizz-kid\" - and led to his defeat at the hands of Mahama.",
      "Ghanaian economist Prof Godfred Bokpin told the BBC the challenges facing the next government were huge.",
      "\"What Ghana needs right now is credible leadership, lean government and efficiency in public service delivery. Without that, there cannot be a future,\" he said.",
      "Mahama has promised to bring down the size of the cabinet from more than 80 to around 60, but Prof Bokpin argued it should be even smaller while political analyst Dr Kwame Asah-Asante stressed the need for appointments to be on merit rather than loyalty.",
      "Mahama will be flanked by former Education Minister Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang, who is set to become Ghana's first female vice-president when the new government takes office next month.",
      "Dr Yakubu said her appointment was not one of \"tokenism\" and she was not someone who could be \"manipulated\".",
      "\"We have a fantastic first female vice-president in Prof Naana Jane Opoku-Agyemang,\" she told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast.",
      "Mahama served his first four-year term as president after winning in 2012, but lost his re-election bid in 2016 as Nana Akufo-Addo rose to power with Bawumia as his running-mate.",
      "Dr Yakubu said Mahama contested the 2016 election on his track record in building roads, schools and hospitals but voters rejected him, as their mantra then was: \"We don't eat infrastructure.\"",
      "But, she said, during the Covid pandemic voters came to appreciate the infrastructure his government had built, especially hospitals.",
      "This - along with the fact that the economy had plunged into a deep crisis under the current government, forcing it to seek a $3bn (\u00a32.4bn) bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) - led to Mahama being re-elected, Dr Yakubu added.",
      "She told the BBC that Mahama would now be expected to fulfil his campaign promise to create jobs in order to bring down the unemployment rate of almost 15%, and to ease the cost-of-living crisis by scrapping some taxes - or what Ghanaians call \"nuisance taxes\".",
      "Mahama has promised to make Ghana a \"24-hour economy\" through the creation of night-time jobs in both the public and private sectors. He said he would give businesses tax incentives to stay open at night and reduce electricity prices for them.",
      "But his critics have doubts, pointing out that Ghana plunged into its worst electricity crisis during his first term and the power cuts were so bad that Mahama joked at the time that he was known as \"Mr Dumsor\" - \"dum\" means \"off\" and \"sor\" means \"on\" in the local Twi language.",
      "He has pledged to abolish several taxes - including the much-criticised electronic levy on mobile transactions and the one on the carbon emissions produced by petrol or diesel-powered vehicles.",
      "Prof Bokpin said he doubted the Mahama administration would be able to fulfil its promises.",
      "\"They have not done the cost-benefit analysis. There's no budgetary space to translate those promises into actuals,\" he said.",
      "But Mahama is confident he will prove his critics wrong, saying he intends to renegotiate the conditions of the IMF loan so money is freed up for \"social intervention programmes\" in a country where 7.3 million people live in poverty.",
      "In an interview ahead of the election, Mahama told the BBC the IMF wanted \"a certain balance\" in government finances.",
      "\"If you're able to cut expenditure, and you're able to increase revenue and increase non-tax revenue coming in, you'll be able to create a balance,\" he said.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama's experience as former president would stand him in good stead to navigate Ghana through choppy waters.",
      "\"Of course, he is likely to encounter difficulties, but he has what it takes to turn things around,\" the analyst added.",
      "Apart from the economy, corruption is one of the biggest issues facing Ghana but not everyone is convinced that Mahama will be able to tackle the scourge.",
      "Mahama's previous stint in government - as vice-president and president - was plagued by corruption allegations, although he has consistently denied any wrongdoing.",
      "In 2020, a UK court had found that aviation giant Airbus had used bribes to secure contracts with Ghana for military planes between 2009 and 2015.",
      "An investigation was then started in Ghana, but the Office of the Special Prosecutor, in a decision announced just months before the election, concluded there was no evidence that Mahama was involved in any corrupt activities himself.",
      "The outgoing government has also been dogged by corruption allegations, including over the purchase of ambulance spare parts at a cost of $34.9m and a  controversial national cathedral project in which $58m has been spent without any progress in building it.",
      "Mahama promised his government would tackle corruption, and ensure that officials were prosecuted for wrongdoing.",
      "\"We are thinking about special courts,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Dr Asah-Asante said Mahama should demand financial accountability from the outgoing government during a handover phase so that \"whatever has gone wrong,  he will be able to right\" as soon as his government takes office next month.",
      "The analyst added that Mahama, who will be inaugurated next month when President Akufo-Addo steps down after his two terms in office, had no choice but to meet the expectations of Ghanaians - or else they would \"punish his government the way they have punished the NPP\".",
      "Mahama succinctly acknowledged this in his victory speech, saying: \"Expectations of Ghanaians are very high, and we cannot afford to disappoint them.",

    "story": [
      "Francis Ford Coppola, the visionary director behind \"The Godfather\" and \"Apocalypse Now,\" was named a 2024 Kennedy Center honoree earlier this year, celebrating his lifetime of artistic achievements. Over a career spanning more than half a century, the 85-year-old filmmaker has earned five Oscars, six Golden Globes, two Palme d'Or awards and a BAFTA.",
      "When asked if there is a signature \"Coppola style,\" the director said, \"I think I was always someone even as a 17-year-old, 18-year-old film director who wanted to poeticize the work I did, but then take it to the very brink where if I took it any further, it would fall off the cliff.\"",
      "The daring creative philosophy has shaped some of the most influential films in history, including \"The Conversation\" and \"The Godfather\" trilogy.",
      "Coppola's journey began in Detroit, where he was born into an Italian-American family. Raised in Queens, New York, he was heavily influenced by his parents, especially his father Carmine, a flutist for Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra. That is where he learned that music and pictures are not always connected.",
      "While in college, Coppola was deeply inspired by Sergei Eisenstein's silent film \"October: 10 Days That Shook the World.\"",
      "\"It was a silent picture, but they weren't playing any accompaniment,\" he said. \"And I was amazed at how the film itself sort of made you think you were hearing it because of the way it was cut. I came out of that experience absolutely bowled over.\"",
      "Coppola followed his passion for film to UCLA. \"I had no money. I had no car. I had no girlfriend. I had nothing,\" he said.",
      "After graduating, Warner Brothers hired him to direct \"Finian's Rainbow,\" and in 1970, his screenplay for \"Patton\" earned him his first Academy Award.",
      "At just 29, Coppola signed on to co-write and direct \"The Godfather,\" a film that became a cornerstone of modern cinema. \"I really was an Italian-American. So although I didn't know gangsters, I knew that to the detail of what life was like in that kind of household,\" he said.",
      "Casting Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone proved challenging. \"I was ordered by the head of the studio that I couldn't even mention Brando,\" Coppola said. Eventually, the studio agreed \u2014 on three conditions. \"He has to do the movie for nothing, no fee; he has to shoot a screen test; he has to put up a million-dollar bond. So, I said, 'I accept.'\"",
      "Brando's transformation into the character astonished the studio. The studio dropped all conditions after seeing Brando's screen test, and the rest is history.",
      "\"The Godfather\" earned Coppola an Oscar nomination for Best Director and a win for Best Adapted Screenplay. He continued his streak with adaptations like \"The Outsiders.\"",

      "Cage is just one of many members of the Coppola family who have pursued successful careers in the arts.

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:21:53 -0500",
    "summary": "The singer-songwriter went from being an NYU music student wowing Pharrell Williams in a viral video, to selling out Madison Square Garden. She talks about musical obsessions, and her appreciation for listeners with patience.",
    "story": [
      "In a nondescript building in a tiny Pennsylvania town, Maggie Rogers was getting ready for her big moment. Lititz, Pa., is where arena acts come to rehearse their shows before heading out on national tour, and every detail matters. \"Sunday Morning\" caught up with Rogers there, just weeks away from her concerts at Madison Square Garden.",
      "In a career-defining event, she sold out the New York City venue. \"Twice!\" she laughed. \"I don't know how to, like, compute that in my brain. I don't understand it fundamentally!\"",
      "To be clear, it wasn't Rogers' first time on a big stage; she'd already shared them with the likes of Bruce Springsteen, Joan Baez, and a stint opening for Coldplay. She was also a 2020 Grammy-nominee for best new artist.",
      "But for Rogers, who studied music at New York University, playing Madison Square Garden was a homecoming of sorts. Walking through Washington Square Park, not far from her former dorm room, she pointed out the benches where she used to write songs. It was at NYU where Rogers got what you might call her big break \u2013 or at least a big break, when superstar producer and musician Pharrell Williams visited her class. Rogers played him a song she'd been working on called \"Alaska.\" \"What I remember is really just staring at my shoes and, like, holding on tight,\" she said.",
      "Williams' response: \"Wow! Wow! I have zero, zero, zero notes for that, and I'll tell you why: you're doing your own thing. It's singular.\"",
      "The video clip of Williams' master class went viral, but Rogers \u2013 who actually started out studying music engineering \u2013 still needed to learn the craft of writing and performing, which is just what she did. \"I've played, like, every bar and club on the Lower East Side, and every DIY venue in Brooklyn that existed in my time here,\" she said.",
      "Now, at the age of 30, Rogers has built a close relationship with her fans, many of whom watched her go from small clubs to being an artist that record labels were fighting over.",
      "Remember that demo she played for Pharrell Williams as a college student? So far, the music video of the finished version of \"Alaska\" has been viewed more than 23 million times.",
      "It's all been an incredible journey, considering Rogers says she didn't actually play music publicly all that much as she was growing up on Maryland's Eastern Shore. Her interest was more personal, private and quirky: \"Basically, as soon as I could ask for music lessons, all I wanted to do was play the harp,\" she said. \"My first CD purchase was a double-purchase of the orchestral score to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,' and Britney's 'Baby One More Time.' Which, like, maybe is all you need to know about me!\"",
      "And you hear it in her songs \u2013 a pop sensibility with a tremendous intellect behind it. Rogers says the whole arena thing is fun, but what she's really hoping to do is form a deep, long-term connection with her listeners along the themes of love and heartbreak and the weird wondrous thing that it is just to be alive. \"I really prefer to work in long form,\" Rogers said. \"And I really feel a lot of gratitude for listeners that want to have an active listening practice, and who also have the patience to want to spend an hour of their time listening to the way that I, you know, sequence the record, or who has appreciation for those things. I've always loved art that takes time.\"",
      "Something else that separates Rogers from your typical pop star: Back in 2021, she took time away from her music to enroll in a graduate program at Harvard University focusing on religion and public life. \"I really needed a second,\" she said. \"I needed to sort of reorient my life, and I needed to be new at something. I had been living in a world where everything was about me and my career for, like, five years, and then applying that to music, and to concerts, and to these really large public gatherings.\"",
      "Large public gatherings that have become, for both Rogers and her fans, something almost spiritual: \"This couldn't have happened in any different way,\" she said. \"Like, I'm reaching Madison Square Garden and stepping on that stage, and being like, 'I'm really ready for this.' And that, in itself, is such a gift that I've sort of tried to keep from contextualizing this for myself. Because as soon as you figure out what it is, it changes, you know? I'm always at the eye of the storm! It's really calm where I sit. And I'll never, ever be able to know what it looks like from the outside. But what I can know is when I've really dedicated myself to my art, and when I think I'm at my best. And I like to think that I'm doing both of those things as much as possible.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 10:07:40 -0500",
    "summary": "In her latest film, Nicole Kidman plays a successful CEO who takes up with a much younger intern. She talks about how she chooses such intense and challenging roles.",
    "story": [
      "I last talked with Nicole Kidman for \"Sunday Morning\" several years ago. Not much has happened since then. Just kidding! Kidman is in the middle of a \"golden era,\" following her Emmy-winning turn in the TV series \"Big Little Lies.\"",
      "To name just two of her recent projects: the TV series \"The Perfect Couple,\" co-starring Liev Schreiber; and \"Special Ops: Lioness,\" with Zoe Salda\u00f1a.",
      "Is the sense that time is fleeting part of why she has been so prolific? \"Yeah, probably,\" Kidman said.",
      "She's still the better half of country great Keith Urban. But the thing Kidman is getting the most attention for these days is a film coming out on Christmas \u2026 and what a film it is. In \"Babygirl,\" Kidman plays a happily married, successful CEO who is in some ways unfulfilled, so she takes up with a handsome intern (Harris Dickinson, of \"Triangle of Sadness\") who knows just how to scratch her particular itch.",
      "I asked, \"Was there any point where you thought, 'Oh, I don't know if I can do this'?\"",
      "\"Yeah, yeah. And a lot of it is stamina, 'cause I'm in every frame of the film,\" she replied.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Babygirl,\" click on the video player below:",
      "Kidman is committed to working a lot with female directors, and in Halina Reijn's hands, the film is intense and relentless.",
      "I asked: \"Do you think part of what makes you do your job \u2013 \"",
      "\"Weird?\" Kidman offered.",
      "\"Well \u2026 weird, yeah, that's where I was going with that?\"",
      "\"You can say it!\"",
      "\"Do you think part of what makes you a good actor is that ability to feel intensely?\"",
      "\"Probably the thing that I have is the ability to feel, like, really feel,\" Kidman said. \"I go into hospitals. Keith and I will work where we go \u2026 he'll bring his guitar and we'll just, you know, in the oncology units. And I have to not absorb someone else's emotions.\"",
      "\"Because that's your tendency? That's what you tend to do?\"",
      "\"Yeah. And Keith's always said, 'You're like a raw egg that I have to be the shell for.'\"",
      "Kidman doesn't look all that vulnerable, but when she's not out being a global superstar, she's a complete homebody. In fact, the daily routine at her Nashville home, with Keith and their two daughters, might sound a lot like yours. \"We have breakfast together every morning, so even if I'm working, I'm up. And then dinners. I also like putting on my jammies and coming home.\"",
      "\"Are you a homebody?\"",
      "\"Yeah, putting on my bed socks. But we do have a rule: You can't put your pajamas on before 5:00 p.m.\"",
      "\"Why do you have that rule?\"",
      "\"Because otherwise, you can get into them a lot earlier. Not a good thing!\"",
      "But there have been moments, Kidman says, when she seriously thought about being a full-time stay-at-home mom \u2013 giving up the whole acting thing. She says that in 2008, after she gave birth to her daughter, Sunday, \"I was like, 'Well, I think I'm pretty much done now.' I had moved to Nashville. We were living on a farm. And that's when my mom actually said, 'I wouldn't give up completely. Keep a finger sort of in it.' And I'm like, 'No, no. I'm done now. I'm done.' She's going, 'Just listen to me. I think, keep moving forward. Not saying that you have to do it to the level you've been doing it, but I wouldn't give it up completely.'\"",
      "After that, Kidman went on to do some of the best work of her career, and this past April she received the lifetime achievement award from the American Film Institute.\u00a0 Her pal Meryl Streep did the honors that night, speaking of Nicole: \"The hardest part is when you come up against, or you're acting with another person who is also really, really, really, really, really, really great. That's difficult for me!\"",
      "Kidman said the honor felt strange. \"'Cause at first I was like, 'I'm not sure I want this right now. Does that mean it's over?'\"",
      "But for Kidman, who's already picked up a Golden Globe nomination for her performance in \"Babygirl,\" the year's stratospheric highs have been tempered by a devastating loss: Her mother, Jannele, died in September at age 84, as Kidman was en route to the Venice Film Festival for a screening of \"Babygirl.\"",
      "I asked Kidman, \"Did you share with her what it was about?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She knew. She knew everything,\" she replied. \"That's probably the biggest loss, is you lose the person that knows everything, that loves you anyway. I love when people say, 'There is no limit to your grief. You don't have to have a time limit on it. You don't have to be all better by this time.' So, you're allowed to constantly let it pass through in waves. \u2026 People go, 'Oh, well, whatever.' But it's my mama, my life, and I'm allowed to process it and grieve in the way I want to.\"",
      "\"Yeah, there is no time limit. And it does come in waves.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's weird.\"",
      "\"And you never know when it's gonna hit.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it's like it's a different road,\" Kidman said. \"When my papa passed \u2013 and I suppose it's good to talk about it all, because so many people in the world are going through it \u2013 but it's just a whole other thing, both parents gone. Just like, 'Whoa. Okay. Wow.'\"",
      "\"But that's okay. And I appreciate your sharing it. Because, like you said, people \u2013\"",
      "\"Move on quick!\" Kidman laughed. \"Now I'm embarrassed!\"",
      "Kidman may keep her emotions within easy reach, but that's not a bad thing: In the same face that you might see torrents of rage and grief, you can just as easily see happiness and hope.",
      "I asked her, \"Do you feel like this now is a moment \u2013 you know, all of these awards, the festivals, several hit television series \u2013 do you feel like you're in this moment right now?\"",
      "\"No,\" Kidman replied. \"I'm just me. But I think 'cause I've had so many years of so many different things happening and I'm fully cognizant of where I am, I'm wide awake. I'm in this world. I'm curious, and grateful, and amazed. I love the word wonder, 'cause I still have a lot of wonder, and a lot of excitement about what's to come.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 09:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In the new Broadway revival of \"Gypsy,\" six-time Tony Award-winner Audra McDonald takes on one of musical theater's most demanding roles: stage mother Rose, who pushes daughter Gypsy Rose Lee into becoming a striptease artist.",
    "story": [
      "She's the mother of all stage mothers: Rose, a single mom hellbent on turning her two young daughters into stars during the waning days of vaudeville. But in the musical \"Gypsy,\" she gets top billing. Rosalind Russell played her in the 1962 movie; Bette Midler in the 1993 TV version; and on stage, where it all started, Rose has been played by some of Broadway's greats, including Ethel Merman, Angela Lansbury, Tyne Daly, Bernadette Peters and Patti LuPone.",
      "And opening this week, six-time Tony Award winner Audra McDonald will take on one of musical theater's most demanding roles. \"It's a high gear the entire time,\" she said. \"And instead of someone sweeping me up in the tornado, I'm the tornado!\"",
      "It's a part that's been compared to Shakespeare's King Lear. According to Erick Neher, cultural editor for the Hudson Review, \"What Lear is to classical actors, that is what Rose is to musical theater. It's the Everest. It's the summit. It's an impossible role in a way, and yet every great musical theatre actress wants to test herself with it.\"",
      "McDonald said, \"Everest is there for a reason. People want to climb it, right? I mean, it's there because it's majestic and it's incredible, and people are like, 'I want to figure out if I can get up there.' And that's what I'm trying to do.\"",
      "The musical was inspired by the memoir of Gypsy Rose Lee, one of the world's most famous striptease artists. But the musical's creators, including writer Arthur Laurents, weren't interested in telling her story. Neher said, \"The really interesting thing about the show 'Gypsy' is that it's not really about Gypsy Rose Lee or even her sister June, who became a very well-known actress, June Havoc. It's about their mother, a tyrannical, insane, fabulous woman who pushed these two young girls onto the stage.\"",
      "It's Rose who volunteers her older daughter to perform a striptease for the first time. Were audiences shocked by the idea of a mother who would push her daughter to basically become a stripper? \"It's still shocking today, I think, when we see it,\" said Neher.",
      "Before \"Gypsy,\" stage mothers were largely played for laughs, as they still are today; think reality shows like \"Dance Moms.\" Neher said, \"What really differentiates 'Gypsy' is that it's the first work in any genre that I can think of that takes this comic character of the pushy stage mother and then does this psychological deep-dive into it.\"",
      "\"I admire the ferocity,\" said five-time Tony Award-winner George C. Wolfe, who is directing this production. \"I think it's about not enough, people living with not enough: Not enough money, not enough space, not enough love, not enough approval, not enough success. And it becomes this dynamic of people wanting that thing, desperately wanting that thing that is just beyond their reach.\"",
      "The question that looms over any production of \"Gypsy\" is, why does this woman drive her children so hard \u2026 and ultimately away from her?",
      "McDonald said, \"I think she is a dedicated mother. I think she is a fiercely protective mother. I think she is a mother who does not realize that the umbilical cord has been cut. I don't see Rose as a monster mother at all.\"",
      "So, is she in this for her kids, or for herself? \"I don't think she can differentiate between the two,\" McDonald said.",
      "Rose may stop at nothing in pursuit of her dream. But the director and star of this production \u2013 the first on Broadway in which mother and daughters are played by Black actors \u2013 say there's a good reason.",
      "According to Wolfe, \"It's not a selfish dream. It's not a 'my' dream. It's a wonderful dream for me and my kids.\"",
      "McDonald adds, \"Which is so interesting, too, then, why society has the audacity to say, 'How dare she have that dream for her kids?' I did what society laid out for me: 'No.' And look where it got me: 'No.' My kids are just supposed to go to school like other girls, and cook and clean and sit and die? And especially that feels like that hits hard, too, as a Black woman saying, 'No, they're not gonna do that.'\"",
      "It may all sound pretty serious for a musical. But did we mention there are some real showstoppers in \"Gypsy\" \u2026 and an adorable pooch?",
      "\"She really, really sweet,\" McDonald said, who introduced us to the dog who plays Chowsie. \"We saw a lotta dogs. It took a while before we found the right one. No one's watching you when they're on stage, that much I do know!\" she laughed.",

      "Abdul, a Grammy and Emmy-winning singer and dancer, said in the lawsuit that she remained silent for years about the alleged assaults out of fear of retaliation by \"one of the most well-known producers of television competition shows.\"",
      "She alleged that the first sexual assault occurred while Abdul and Lythgoe were on the road filming auditions for an early season of \"American Idol,\" which premiered in 2002.",

    "summary": "Bonnie Raitt reflects on her 50-year career, including iconic hits like \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" to her recent Kennedy Center honor.",
    "story": [
      "Bonnie Raitt's 1989 hit \"Thing Called Love\" is just one of the many highlights from her 50-year career. This year, the 13-time Grammy Award winner, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee, and one of Rolling Stone's greatest singers and guitar players of all time, added another accolade to her already impressive resume: Kennedy Center honoree.",
      "Reflecting on the honor, Raitt said, \"It's unreal to me that I'm gonna be up in that balcony \u2026 my friends will be saying all that nice stuff and singing my songs. I wasn't expecting it. And I'm just tickled beyond words.\"",
      "Raitt's songs have provided a sentimental soundtrack for many, with hits like \"I Can't Make You Love Me\" cementing her place in music history.",
      "\"Everybody's had a broken heart,\" Raitt said. \"That's one of the great breakup songs. Every night I sing it, and I know what it means to them. And I know what it means to me.\"",
      "Raitt grew up in a musical household in Southern California, influenced by her father, Broadway star John Raitt, and her mother, singer-pianist Marge Goddard.",
      "\"Here's what seeped in was his love of performing and he couldn't believe that he got paid for doing something that he would love to do anyway. So it was not lost on me. What a gift it was to get to do what he did for a living.\"",
      "Though music started as a hobby, Raitt's passion led her to leave Radcliffe College and pursue a career in blues. A standout as a red-headed guitarist and singer, she secured her first record deal in what would have been her junior year.",
      "Her journey wasn't without setbacks. Dropped by Warner Brothers in 1983, Raitt said, \"They didn't want me to play more rootsy, rock and roll. The big corporate guys took over.\"",
      "She used the time to focus on sobriety and eventually found success with Capitol Records.",
      "Her 1989 album \"Nick of Time\" became a breakthrough, earning Raitt her first Grammy and a spot on the Billboard charts.",
      "\"It was mind-blowing,\" she said. \"Even before the Grammy nomination, it sold a million copies.\"",
      "Hits like \"Something to Talk About\" and her recent Grammy-winning song of the year prove that Raitt's talent has only grown over time.",
      "Looking ahead, Raitt already has 39 tour dates scheduled for 2025.",
      "\"I just want to make as big of a difference in the world as I can,\" she said. \"I'm confident that ... as long as I give everything I've got to quality music and play as great a performance as I could, that the audience is gonna come back and see me next time.\"",

Kennedy, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, after The New York Times reported that one of Kennedy's top advisers had filed petitions to revoke the approval of a polio vaccine and several other shots.",

      "The\u00a0Times article focused in large part on the work of attorney Aaron Siri for the nonprofit Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, which petitioned the Food and Drug Administration in 2022 \"demanding that the FDA suspend or withdraw approval\" of Sanofi Pasteur's inactivated polio vaccine, called IPOL.",

      "In a 2023 letter responding to the polio petition, the agency's top vaccine official, Dr. Peter Marks, wrote that the FDA \"has been unable to reach a decision on your petition because it raises issues requiring further review and analysis by agency officials.\"",
      "Siri's petition targets IPOL, which is the only \"single-antigen\" polio vaccine currently recommended for use in the U.S. The vaccine was approved in the 1990s.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration has not formally reevaluated the safety of a food dye called Red 40 in over a decade, the agency's top food official said this month when asked about renewed worries over its potential behavioral health effects.",
      "The agency has launched a new effort to take a second look at some previously approved additives. But Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, warned their budget was too small and that it would take years to catch up to other countries.",
      "\"We are several decades behind Europeans and our Canadian counterparts, because they have legal mandates to reevaluate chemicals that have been authorized,\" Jones told Sen. Tommy Tuberville at a hearing of the Senate's health committee.",
      "Tuberville also asked Jones about a different food dye called Red 3, which advocacy groups have petitioned against due to studies showing it causes cancer in animals. Jones suggested the agency could be weeks away from moving to ban it.",
      "The decades-old controversy over synthetic food dyes has gained renewed attention on Capitol Hill, thanks in part to outspoken criticism from Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's pick to head the department overseeing the FDA and other health agencies.",
      "\"Senator Tuberville looks forward to working with the incoming Trump administration to Make America Healthy Again,\" a spokesperson for the Alabama Republican said, referring to the slogan RFK Jr. has promoted Tuberville was \"shocked to learn\" the FDA had not reviewed Red 40's safety for so long, his spokesperson said.",
      "What is red dye 40?",
      "FD&C Red No. 40, or Red 40 for short, is the FDA's name to refer to a color additive first registered with the agency in the 1970s. The chemical is known as Allura Red AC in the food industry and E 129 in Europe.",
      "It is now mostly synthesized from petroleum.",
      "Further chemical reactions to combine the dye with aluminum create what's known as \"Red 40 Lake.\" Lakes are often used for products like chewing gum where there is not enough moisture to dissolve the dye into the product, or in products like frostings to help prevent the colors from bleeding.",
      "The FDA says it subjects production of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes to stepped-up scrutiny, screening each batch for any contaminants from its production process.",
      "Among the dyes that undergo this purity certification, Red 40 consistently ranks as the one with the highest quantity produced each quarter.",
      "\"People think that 'I know which foods have dyes and which don't,' but no you do not. White foods can contain dyes, foods marketed as healthy and natural can contain dyes, egg noodles can contain dyes, it's just very hard to know and avoid them, unless you look at the label,\" said environmental health consultant Lisa Lefferts.",
      "Lefferts was closely involved with a push by the Center for Science in the Public Interest for the FDA to curb use of synthetic food dyes, as well as a new law in California that will ban Red 40 and some other dyes from school meals starting in 2028.",
      "\"If you talk to parents whose kids are sensitive to dyes, they'll tell you how difficult it is to avoid dyes and what a huge change it was for their entire household to try to get these dyes out of their kids' diets,\" she said.",
      "What foods and drinks have red dye 40?",
      "An FDA study published in 2016 estimated that children are exposed to Red 40 the most from drinks, frozen desserts and cereal.",
      "Databases published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and nonprofit Environmental Working Group tally thousands of foods with Red 40. Medications and cosmetics also have it.",
      "They include products like Kellogg's Froot Loops, a cereal brand that Kennedy has criticized. The foodmaker has faced calls to remove artificial colors, like it did for less fluorescent versions of Froot Loops sold in other countries like Canada. Other major cereal brands like Lucky Charms from General Mills also have Red 40.",
      "Froot Loops maker WK Kellogg\u00a0has said\u00a0that its foods are safe and its ingredients all comply with federal regulations.",
      "Several frozen dessert products also rely on Red 40, including Turkey Hill's Black Raspberry Premium Ice Cream, Breyers' M&M's Minis Caramel Fudge Light Ice Cream, Blue Bell's Birthday Cake Vanilla Flavored Ice Cream Cups and Blue Bunny's Strawberry Flavored Soft Frozen Dairy Dessert.",
      "A number of soft drinks also use Red 40, like Gatorade Fruit Punch and Fanta Soda. Other kinds of beverages also can contain the dye, like several strawberry milk brands or various generic manufacturers of pink lemonade mixes.",
      "Why are there calls to ban red dye 40?",
      "Most calls to restrict Red 40 stem from research commissioned by British food authorities in 2007, which linked increases of hyperactivity in children to mixtures of synthetic dyes.",
      "After the findings, authorities in Europe did not ban the dyes across the continent. Canada also continues to permit use of Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes.",
      "But the United Kingdom and Europe did add warnings to labels for foods containing any of the dyes from the tested mixtures, including Red 40, saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "A review by California's Environmental Protection Agency in 2021 looking at dozens of studies agreed \"that synthetic food dyes can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children,\" including Red 40.",
      "Lefferts said it was \"a no-brainer\" that synthetic dyes should be pulled from the food supply, given concerns over this risk. She praised California's review for integrating data from animal and lab studies, helping to fill in gaps from human research to prove a causal link.",
      "\"Synthetic food dyes are completely unnecessary. They can be omitted entirely or replaced with safe alternatives. Their purpose is purely cosmetic and we have all this evidence,\" said Lefferts.",
      "In a statement, the International Association of Color Manufacturers cited past FDA advisory panels, as well as findings by European and international health authorities, which have stopped short of concluding there was a causal link between Red 40 and hyperactivity.",
      "\"The FDA regulates the safety and labeling of all color additives, and it does so based on scientific evidence. As such, the FDA has determined and continues to maintain that FD&C Red No. 40 is safe,\" said Sarah Codrea, the trade group's executive director.",
      "Why isn't red dye 40 banned in the U.S.?",
      "After the British study led authorities in Europe to warn about dyes like Red 40, the FDA convened a meeting of its food advisers in 2011 to review their safety.",
      "The panel voted narrowly against a similar kind of warning. Most said they thought studies had fallen short of proving a causal link, but were split on whether the studies warranted a warning.",
      "\"Causality is a distant aspiration, but certainly these data don't give us any confidence that we can say there's nothing to worry about here,\" committee member Dr. Francisco Xavier Castellanos said during the meeting.",
      "A meeting of the agency's science board later in 2019 concluded that \"most children have no effects from consuming foods containing color additives, though some evidence suggested that certain children may be part of a sensitive subpopulation,\" an FDA spokesperson said.",
      "\"Reassessing the safety of chemicals in food as new, relevant data become available is a priority for the FDA,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Pulling previously approved chemicals off the market is an uphill battle through the cumbersome federal \"rulemaking\" process, which requires the agency to defend its answers to any question or concern raised by opponents of the measure \u2014 often companies with millions of dollars at stake.",
      "\"The agency can't just wave a wand and say, we don't like these anymore. There's whole industries that have been developed using this color additive with the understanding that it's safe,\" said Dennis Keefe, the former director of the FDA's office of food additive safety.",
      "Keefe said adding a warning requires the agency's lawyers to argue a \"compelling public health reason,\" given the high bar set by the First Amendment to compel speech on labels.",
      "Short of Congress stepping in to mandate changes or fund the kind of pricey studies to fill the gaps from previous research, Keefe said the agency faced more pressing public health priorities for its limited food budget.",
      "\"The agency needs to defend, scientifically, in the courts, to take the action. And they would have to have good data that Red 40 in particular is causing these hyperactivities. And the data just really aren't that tight,\" said Keefe.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 17:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age reflects the point at which people can claim their full benefits. It's going up in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Most Americans may consider the standard retirement age to be 65, but the so-called \"full retirement age\" for Social Security is already older than that \u2014 and it's about to hit an even higher age in 2025.",
      "Social Security's full retirement age (FRA) refers to when workers can start claiming their full benefits, which is based on the number of years they've worked as well as their income during their working years. The longer someone works and the higher their income, the more they can receive from Social Security when they finally claim their benefits.",
      "While the FRA used to be 65 years old, Congress overhauled the program in 1983 to raise the retirement age threshold in order to account for longer life expectancies.",
      "As part of that revamp, the FRA has been inching higher by two months at a time, based on a person's birth year. For instance, people who were born in 1957 reached their FRA when they turned 66 years and 6 months old, or starting in 2023; but people born in 1958 must turn 66 years and 8 months old to qualify for their full benefits, or starting in September 2024.",
      "The full retirement age is set to\u00a0increase again by two months, to 66 years and 10 months old, for people born in 1959. That means the higher FRA for that cohort will go into effect in 2025, with people born in 1959 starting to qualify for their full benefits in November 2025. (You can calculate when you could get your full benefits on this Social Security Administration page.)",
      "To be sure, there is flexibility about when to claim Social Security benefits. People can claim as soon as they turn 62 years old, but the trade-off is a reduced benefit that's locked in for the rest of their retirement.",
      "For instance, claiming at 62 will result in a benefit that's about 30% less than your full benefit \u2014 a sacrifice that many older Americans opt for, given that many are forced into retirement earlier than they expected\u00a0or because they believe it makes more sense to claim more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower amount.",
      "Young boomers and Gen Xers",
      "The increase in the FRA for people born in 1959 marks the penultimate age change, with the final jump occurring for workers born in or after 1960. Those Americans won't be able to claim their FRA until they hit 67 years old, which means that someone born in January 1960 must hold off until January 2027 to get their full retirement benefits.",
      "That will mostly impact the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers, with the latter generation spanning 1965 to 1980.",
      "These workers, however, are among the least prepared for retirement, according to recent research. The youngest boomers \u2014 those born between 1959 and 1965 \u2014 started to hit 65 this year, but many of them lack adequate savings to support themselves in old age, the ALI Retirement Income Institute found earlier this year.",
      "About 1 in 3 of these younger boomers will rely on Social Security benefits for at least 90% of their retirement income when they are 70, the study found. But Social Security benefits are designed to replace about 40% of a person's working income.",
      "Gen X, meanwhile, is also shaping up to hit retirement without enough saved for their golden years. The average retirement savings of Gen X households is about $150,000 \u2014 far below the roughly\u00a0$1.5 million\u00a0that Americans say they need to retire comfortably. Another study found that about 40% of Gen Xers don't have a penny saved for retirement.",
      "Meanwhile, older Americans can also maximize their Social Security benefits by delaying claiming until they turn 70 years old. At that point, one's benefits are boosted about 25% higher than their full benefits. But only about 4% of Americans wait until they're 70 to claim the maximum Social Security benefit, according to a recent study from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",

      "The \"report is wrong on the facts and weaves together out-of-date-documents and unverifiable anecdotes to create a preconceived narrative,\" a company spokesperson said.",
      "According to the Senate panel, Amazon in 2021 began studying the impact of repetitive motions on warehouse workers, including how many products they could pick from robotic shelving units. The internal research found that employees who were trying to keep pace with company production quotas usually exceeded the limit beyond which injury rates increased, the report found.",
      "That same study also advised using software to monitor the rate at which workers were picking products and to institute additional breaks to ensure employees were not overdoing the repeated motions. But that recommendation and others aimed at improving workplace safety at Amazon were rejected by senior executives concerned about the \"customer experience,\" the Senate committee said.",
      "A separate investigation by CBS News found that Amazon trucking contractors have higher\u00a0rates of safety violations. Questions about the e-commerce company's practices for moving packages between facilities surfaced after the January death of a 19-year-old Texas college student who was killed in a crash with an Amazon contract driver.",

      "How to create a family safe word",

      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",

      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",

      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security.

But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

While inflation has moderated considerably since then, November's Consumer Price Index rose 2.7%, outpacing the Fed's goal of driving down inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "That signals the battle against inflation isn't yet over, though the November inflation report was in line with economists' expectations. At the same time, the unemployment rate has inched higher this year, sparking concerns from the Fed about weaknesses in the labor market, and helping open the door to its recent rate reductions, noted one economist.",
      "\"The Fed will likely move ahead with another 25-basis point cut at its December meeting,\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree, in an email, adding,\"This could be the last cut for a while though,\" he said.",
      "\"Because the upcoming Trump Administration's policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting,\" Channel noted.",
      "What date is the Federal Reserve meeting in December?",
      "The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is from Dec. 17-18, marking its last meeting of the year.",
      "What time does the Federal Reserve announce rates?",
      "The central bank is set to announce its rate decision on Dec. 18 at 2 p.m. ET.",
      "That will be followed by a press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. ET, during which Powell will discuss the Fed's economic outlook and take questions from reporters.",
      "Will the Fed cut rates in December?",
      "About 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data firm FactSet are forecasting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday.",
      "If that occurs, the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 will be lowered to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its current target range of 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That would mark the Fed's third consecutive rate cut this year, which kicked off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September, followed by a 0.25 percentage point cut at its November meeting.",
      "How will another rate cut impact my money?",
      "Any reduction in the federal funds rate could ease borrowing costs for millions of Americans. But a 0.25 percentage point cut isn't likely to make that much of a difference, with LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz noting that it \"may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment.\"",
      "\"Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn't amount to much for those with debt,\" Schulz said.",
      "Still, new APR rates on credit cards have declined to 24.43% from 24.92% in September, according to LendingTree data. Loan rates for other products, such as home equity lines of credit, have also declined.",
      "Despite the rate cuts, mortgage rates haven't budged much and continue to hover near 20-year highs, leaving many would-be homebuyers disappointed. While the Fed's benchmark rate influences home borrowing costs, mortgages are also impacted by broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "\"Going forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate on a week-to-week basis and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up,\" LendingTree's Channel said.",
      "What's going on with inflation and the economy?",
      "Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services change over time, has cooled since it reached a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "The Fed began pushing its benchmark rate higher in 2022 in order to dampen economic demand and tame inflation. But while inflation has eased since its 2022 peak, prices for many products and services remain considerably higher than they were before the pandemic.",
      "And prices are likely to stay high unless there's a period of deflation, which typically only happens during a steep economic downturn, such as a recession.",
      "That has left many Americans feeling financially tapped out, with millions taking their frustrations to the ballot box last month and voting for Trump's economic vision of ending \"the inflation nightmare.\"",
      "How might Trump's economic plans impact the Fed?",
      "While Trump has vowed to tackle rising prices, some of his policies could prove to be inflationary, according to Wall Street economists. For instance, Trump last month unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on his inauguration day,\u00a0January 20.",
      "The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "But tariffs are essentially consumption taxes that are most often paid by consumers. In other words, American shoppers could end up paying more for everything from avocados imported from Mexico to TV sets manufactured in China.",
      "Because of the potential for inflation to tick higher in 2025 if Trump enacts widespread tariffs, many economists expect the Fed to slow or pause in its rate decisions next year in a wait-and-see approach.",
      "\"Fed officials might prefer to be cautious in light of uncertainty about the new administration's policies, especially possible tariff increases,\" noted Goldman Sachs economists in a Dec. 15 research report.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve cut rates in 2025?",
      "Economists are forecasting that the Fed will continue to cut rates next year, although some are scaling back the number of reductions they've penciled in.",
      "The Fed will release its summary of economic projections (SEP) on Dec. 18, which will provide some insight into what the FOMC is expecting in 2025.",
      "It's possible the Fed's outlook will forecast three rate cuts in 2025 of 0.25 percentage points each, down from four rate cuts the central bank had penciled in when it last released the SEP, in September, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "At his Wednesday press conference, Powell could \"reiterate the familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut 'skip' at the January meeting,\" Daco added.",

    "story": [
      "Japanese tech conglomerate SoftBank plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. and create 100,000 jobs in artificial intelligence and technology, President-elect Donald Trump announced Monday at Mar-a-Lago alongside SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son.",
      "\"Today, I am thrilled to announce that SoftBank will be investing $100 billion America, creating 100,000 American jobs at a minimum,\" Trump said, adding that Son was announcing the investment \"because he feels very optimistic about our country since the election.\"",
      "The investment \"will help insure that artificial intelligence, emerging technologies and other industries of tomorrow are built, created right here in the U.S.A.,\" Trump said.",
      "\"I\"m very, very excited,\" Son said. \"I would really like to celebrate the great victory of President Trump. And my confidence level to the economy of the United States has tremendously increased with his victory.\"",
      "During their announcement, Trump asked Son to double the investment.",
      "\"I'm going to ask him right now, will you make it $200 billion, believe it or not, he can actually afford to do that,\" Trump said. Son responded, \"With your leadership and my parternship and your support, I will try to make it happen.\"",
      "After Trump's 2016 victory, the two announced his firm would invest $50 billion in the U.S. Tokyo-based SoftBank is an investment company that focuses on financial, tech and energy companies.",
      "Trump has touted other investments from major foreign companies that didn't pan out during his presidency. In 2017, he\u00a0announced\u00a0that Taiwanese electronics maker Foxconn \u2014 known for manufacturing Apple's iPhone and iPod devices \u2014 would build a $10 billion campus in Wisconsin in exchange for billions in tax incentives. The venture was forecast to employ more than 10,000 people, bringing high-paying tech jobs to the Midwestern state.",
      "Trump heralded the major tech partnership as \"transformational\" and the \"eighth wonder of the world.\" But seven years later, that vision has \u2014 so far \u2014 failed to flourish. Foxconn did build a small plant on the site, but far smaller than the one Trump and Foxconn initially announced.",
      "In 2019, the campus was scaled back to a \"research hub\" that employed far fewer people than initially promised. The effort instead ended up employing about 1,000 workers,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Wisconsin, for its part,\u00a0said\u00a0in 2020 it would scale back its promise of billions in tax credits, given that Foxconn had failed to deliver on its original plan.",
      "Meanwhile, another major tech company \u2014 Microsoft \u2014 stepped in to fill some of the gap left by Foxconn. In 2024, Microsoft\u00a0said\u00a0it would build a $3.3 billion data center on on 315 acres adjacent to where Foxconn had planned to construct its campus. Microsoft expects its first building on its new Wisconsin site to be completed in 2026,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.",
      "Trump made the SoftBank announcement Monday in a statement to the press that turned into extended remarks about his economic plans. Trump pledged to make more tax cuts, even beyond the ones he and Congress enacted in 2017. Trump said any company that invests at least $1 billion in the U.S. will be eligible for fully expedited permit approvals, including environmental approvals, Trump said.",
      "\"This will be the most exciting and successful period of reform and renewal in all of American history, maybe of global history, the golden age of America, I call it, it's begun,\" Trump said.",

      "\"Every passenger deserves safe, dignified travel when they fly \u2014 and we've taken unprecedented actions to hold airlines accountable when they do not provide fair treatment to passengers with disabilities,\" Secretary Buttigieg said in a statement Monday. \"With the new protections we're announcing today, we're establishing a new standard for air travel \u2014 with clear and thorough guidelines for airlines to ensure that passengers using wheelchairs can travel safely and with dignity.\"",
      "Here's some of what the new rule requires.",

      "During remarks at his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, Trump blamed the Biden administration for what he said was a \"terrible\" and \"ridiculous\" agreement that would allow tens of thousands of federal workers to continue working from home several days a week.",
      "The president-elect said \"it was like a gift to a union, and we're going to obviously be in court to stop it.\" He said federal workers who don't return to in-office work will be fired.",

      "Work-from-home policies for the federal workforce have come under scrutiny by the leaders of Trump's newly created Department of Government Efficiency, billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have said they are looking to cut $2 trillion from the federal budget.",
      "\"Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don't want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn't pay them for the Covid-era privilege of staying home,\" Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal last month.",

      "The measure would increase the burden on Social Security's trust funds, which are already estimated to not be able to pay the full amount of scheduled benefits starting in 2035. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "\"The Senate should reject WEP and GPO repeal. Instead, they should come together to try to fix the issues with WEP and GPO as part of a comprehensive package to strengthen Social Security, prevent insolvency and make the program's finances sustainable over the long term,\" MacGuineas urged.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a vote of 327-75 last month.",

      "Shoppers laden with bags from Fendi, Loewe, Prada and other designer labels clog the narrow sidewalks of Milan's swankiest shopping street, bringing joy to the purveyors of high-end luxury goods this, and every, holiday season.",
      "There's even more to celebrate this year: A commercial real estate company has crowned Via MonteNapoleone as the world's most expensive retail destination, displacing New York's Fifth Avenue.",
      "The latest version of American firm Cushman & Wakefield's annual global index, which ranks shopping areas based on the rent prices they command, is a sign of Via MonteNapoleone's desirability as an address for luxury ready-to-wear, jewelry and even pastry brands.",
      "The average rent on the Milan street has surged to 20,000 euros per square meter ($2,047 per square foot), compared with 19,537 euros per square meter ($2,000 per square foot) on an 11-block stretch of upper Fifth Avenue.",
      "Via MonteNapoleone's small size - it's less than one-quarter mile long - and walking distance to services and top cultural sites are among the street's key advantages, according to Guglielmo Miani, president of the MonteNapoleone District association.",
      "\"Not everything can fit, which is a benefit'' since the limited space makes the street even more exclusive and dynamic, said Miani, whose group also represents businesses on the intersecting side streets that together with Via MonteNapoleone form an area known as Milan's Fashion Quadrilateral.",
      "The biggest brands on the street make 50 million euros ($52.4 million) to 100 million euros in annual sales, Miani said, which goes a long way to paying the rent. Tiffany & Co. is preparing to take up residence on Via Montenapoleone, and long-time tenant Fendi is expanding.",
      "The MonteNapoleone District says 11 million people visited the area this year through November, but there's no way to say how many were big spenders vs. window shoppers. The average shopper on Via MonteNapoleone spent 2,500 euros ($2,624) per purchase between August and November - the highest average receipt in the world, according to the tax-free shopping firm Global Blue.",
      "The street is a magnet for holiday shoppers who arrive in Maseratis, Porsches and even Ferraris, the sports car's limited trunk space notwithstanding. Lights twinkle overhead, boutique windows feature mannequins engaged in warm scenes of holiday fun, and passersby snap photos of expertly decorated cakes in pastry shop displays.",
      "A visitor from China, Chen Xinghan, waited for a taxi with a half-dozen shopping bags lined up next to him on the sidewalk. He said he paid half the price for a luxury Fendi coat that he purchased in Milan than he would have at home.",
      "\"I got a lot,'' Chen acknowledged. \"It's a fantastic place, a good place for shopping.\"",

      "\"I could knit that in one hour, using 12-gauge knitting needles as thick as my fingers, and thick wool. Maximum two hours,'' Da Rold said, but acknowledged the brand appeal.",
      "Despite upper Fifth Avenue getting bumped to the No. 2 spot on the Cushman & Wakefield list, the organization that serves as the Manhattan street's guardian and chief promoter had praise for MonteNapoleone's achievement.",
      "\"Milan's investment in its public realm is paying off, which is a win for their shoppers, businesses and city as a whole,'' said Madelyn Wils, the interim president of the Fifth Avenue Association.",
      "But she also expressed confidence that with new investments and a record year for sales on Fifth Avenue, \"we'll be back on top in no time.\""

    "title": "Here's what Trump's plans to extend his tax cuts could mean for you",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 07:51:43 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump has said he wants to extend the 2017 tax cuts, plus throw in a few more. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "During his electoral campaign, President-elect Donald Trump pledged to extend many provisions in his signature Tax Cuts & Jobs Act, a 2017 law that overhauled the tax code and handed a financial break to almost every taxpayer.",
      "Many of those provisions are set to expire at the end of 2025, such as the current individual tax brackets and standard deduction. If lawmakers are unable to pass legislation to extend the TCJA reforms next year, more than 6 in 10 filers would face a tax increase in 2026, according to an analysis from the Tax Foundation.",
      "While those dates may seem distant, passing a major tax bill before the TCJA provisions expire next year represents a significant undertaking by Congress. Beyond extending the tax breaks, Trump also dangled a host of additional cuts to everyone from tipped workers, vowing to eliminate taxes on tips, to senior citizens, promising to eliminate taxes on Social Security income.",
      "Extending the TCJA will \"keep people in a stable place,\" Duncan Campbell, tax leader in Baker Tilly's private wealth practice, told CBS MoneyWatch. But \"we might not see anything and wake up in 2026 with everything setting back to pre-TCJA, and some folks who didn't think about it are like, 'Oh shoot',\" he added.",
      "In the accounting and advisory firm's tax planning with clients, Campbell noted that Baker Tilly is preparing as if the TCJA provisions could expire at the end of 2025. That helps people protect themselves financially and avoids being caught flat-footed in case Congress fails to pass an extension.",
      "\"Prepare as if everything is sunsetting,\" Campbell advised. \"Something is going to happen to the TCJA, but there is a whole year of things that need to happen before that from a new administration and a new Congress.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the potential federal income tax changes in 2025 and how they could affect you.",
      "Could the Trump tax brackets expire?",
      "The expiring Tax Cut & Jobs Act provisions that could impact the greatest number of taxpayers are the law's tax brackets, which would revert to their pre-TCJA thresholds if Congress fails to extend the changes under the 2017 law.",
      "Another provision that could also impact millions of taxpayers is the TCJA's larger standard deduction. Under the tax law, the standard deduction nearly doubled, providing more Americans with a bigger shield for their income. The standard deduction, which reduces a taxpayer's taxable income, will be $15,000 for single taxpayers in 2025 and $30,000 for couples filing jointly.",
      "But if that provision expires, the standard deduction would shrink to $8,350 for single filers in 2026 and $16,700 for joint filers, according to the Tax Foundation. Personal exemptions, which were eliminated under the TCJA, would return, at $5,300 per filer.",
      "What about the Child Tax Credit?",
      "Without an extension of the TCJA, the Child Tax Credit would also revert to its pre-TCJA level in 2026.",
      "\"The maximum child tax credit would revert back to $1,000 from $2,000 under TCJA and begin phasing out at $75,000 in adjusted gross income for single filers and $110,000 for joint filers, compared to $200,000 and $400,000, respectively, under the TCJA,\" the Tax Foundation notes.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers are sounding the alarm about the potential cut to this tax credit, although they largely voted against a bill earlier this year that would have expanded the CTC to provide more relief to low-income families.",
      "In a December 11 statement, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, advocated for the extension of the $2,000 CTC.",
      "\"Raising a family can be challenging enough without Washington pulling the rug out from under parents,\" Smith said. \"But that's exactly what will happen if the 2017 Trump tax cuts are allowed to expire next year.\"",
      "Could the $10,000 SALT cap deduction change?",
      "The state and local tax (SALT) deduction allows taxpayers who itemize to deduct property taxes, sales taxes, and state or local income taxes from their federal income taxes. Prior to the TCJA, there was no limit on how much people could deduct through the SALT deduction.",
      "The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, regardless of whether claimants file as a single taxpayer or married filing jointly \u2014 a measure that was widely criticized\u00a0in regions with high property taxes, such as many areas of the Northeast.",
      "In the years since the tax law was passed, more people have been hit with the SALT deduction cap due to the rise in property values and local taxes. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to scrap the $10,000 cap, while his economic adviser Stephen Moore on Thursday said the new administration would like to raise the cap to $20,000.",
      "How likely is Congress to extend Trump's tax cuts?",
      "Republicans have a majority in the House and Senate, as they did in 2017 when Congress passed the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. That greatly boosts the odds of extending the tax cuts.",
      "At the same time, economists and fiscal hawks are raising concerns about the fiscal impact of prolonging the cuts, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimating that extending all the provisions could add more than $5 trillion to the deficit through fiscal year 2035.",
      "For their part, Trump campaign officials have floated cuts in federal spending as a way to eliminate the nation's growing deficit. Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped by Trump to create recommendations on slashing spending, with the pair saying their Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, plans to cut $500 billion in costs.",
      "However, DOGE is an advisory body, not a federal agency, and it remains to be determined how effective the group will be in reducing spending.",
      "What should you do now ahead of potential tax changes in 2025?",
      "If possible, prepare for the TCJA provisions expiring next year, Campbell advised. That's going to be most applicable for higher-income Americans, who are more likely to be affected by some of the changes.",
      "For instance, the TCJA almost doubled the lifetime estate and gift tax exemption \u2014 the amount people can gift to others without paying taxes \u2014 to $13.6 million per person and $27.2 million for a married couple. If the TCJA expires, that would decline to about $7.5 million per individual and $14.5 million for a married couple, according\u00a0to Fidelity.",
      "To be sure, that change wouldn't impact most Americans, but those with significant assets may want to plan ahead, Campbell said. \"If you do nothing, you have lost out on the ability to transfer another $7 million\" before the provision expires, he added.",
      "Another potential change is the expiration of the qualified business income deduction, which allowed small business owners, freelancers and others who own their own business to deduct 20% of their income from their taxes. That tax break is set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "If that isn't extended, small business owners should plan to set aside extra cash to pay higher taxes in 2026, Campbell said. \"The law is what the law is today, and it's going to expire,\" he said. \"That should be first and foremost in our planning.\"",

    "summary": "Popeye, Tintin and \"A Farewell to Arms\" are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the United States on Jan. 1. meaning they can be used and repurposed without the OK of or payment to copyright holders.",
    "story": [
      "Popeye can punch without permission and Tintin can roam freely starting in 2025. The two classic comic characters who first appeared in 1929 are among the intellectual properties becoming public domain in the United States on Jan. 1. That means they can be used and repurposed without permission or payment to copyright holders.",
      "This year's crop of newly public artistic creations lacks the landmark vibes of last year's entrance of into the public domain of Mickey Mouse. But they include a deep well of canonical works whose 95-year copyright maximums will expire. And the Disney icon's public domain presence expands.",
      "\"It's a trove! There are a dozen new Mickey cartoons - he speaks for the first time and dons the familiar white gloves,\" said Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke's Center for the Study of the Public Domain. \"There are masterpieces from Faulkner and Hemingway, the first sound films from Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and John Ford, and amazing music from Fats Waller, Cole Porter, and George Gershwin. Pretty exciting!\"",
      "A closer look at this year's crop",
      "Popeye the Sailor, with his bulging forearms, mealy-mouthed speech, and propensity for fistfights, was created by E.C. Segar and made his first appearance in the newspaper strip \"Thimble Theater\" in 1929, speaking his first words, \"'Ja think I'm a cowboy?\" when asked if he was a sailor. What was supposed to be a one-off appearance became permanent, and the strip would be renamed \"Popeye.\"",
      "But as with Mickey Mouse last year and Winnie the Pooh in 2022, only the earliest version is free for reuse. The spinach that gave the sailor his super-strength wasn't there from the start and is the kind of character element that could spawn legal disputes. And the animated shorts featuring his distinctive mumbly voice didn't begin until 1933 and remain under copyright. As does director Robert Altman's 1980 film starring Robin Williams as Popeye and Shelley Duvall as his oft-fought-over sweetheart Olive Oyl.",
      "That movie was tepidly received initially. So was director Steven Spielberg's \"Adventures of Tintin\" in 2011. But the comics about the boy reporter that inspired it, the creation of Belgian artist Herg\u00e9, were among the most popular in Europe for much of the 20th century.",
      "The simply drawn teen with dots for eyes and bangs like an ocean wave first appeared in a supplement to the Belgian newspaper Le Vingti\u00e8me Si\u00e8cle, and became a weekly feature.",
      "The comic also first appeared in the U.S. in 1929. Its signature bright colors - including Tintin's red hair - didn't appear until years later, and could, like Popeye's spinach, be the subject of legal disputes.",
      "And in much of the world, Tintin won't become public property until 70 years after the 1983 death of his creator.",
      "The books becoming public this year read like the syllabus for an American literature seminar.",
      "\"The Sound and the Fury,\" arguably William Faulkner's quintessential novel with its modernist stream-of-consciousness style, was a sensation after its publication despite being famously difficult for readers. It uses multiple non-linear narratives to tell the story of a prominent family's ruin in the author's native Mississippi, and would help lead to Faulkner's Nobel Prize.",
      "And Ernest Hemingway's \"A Farewell to Arms\" joins his earlier \"The Sun Also Rises\" in the public domain. The partly autobiographical story of an ambulance driver in Italy during the First World War cemented Hemingway's status in the American literary canon. It has been frequently adapted for film, TV and radio, which can now be done without permission.",
      "John Steinbeck's first novel, \"A Cup of Gold,\" from 1929, will also enter the public domain.",
      "The British novelist Virginia Woolf's \"A Room of One's Own,\" an extended essay that would become a landmark in feminism from the modernist literary luminary, is also on the list. Her novel \"Mrs. Dalloway\" is already in the U.S. public domain.",
      "While a host of truly major movies will become public in the coming decade, for now early works by major figures from the not-always-stellar early sound era will have to suffice.",
      "A decade before he would move to Hollywood and make films like \"Psycho,\" and \"Vertigo,\" Alfred Hitchcock made \"Blackmail\" in Britain. The film was begun as a silent but shifted to sound during production, resulting in two different versions, one of them the U.K.'s - and Hitchcock's - first sound film.",
      "John Ford, whose later Westerns would put him among film's most vaunted directors, also made his first foray into sound with 1929's \"The Black Watch,\" an adventure epic that includes Ford's future chief collaborator John Wayne as a young extra.",
      "Cecil B. DeMille, already a Hollywood bigwig through silents, made his first talkie with the melodrama \"Dynamite.\"",
      "Groucho, Harpo and the other Marx Brothers had their first starring movie roles in 1929's \"The Cocoanuts,\" a forerunner to future classics like \"Animal Crackers\" and \"Duck Soup.\"",
      "\"The Broadway Melody,\" the first sound film and the second film ever to win the Oscar for best picture - known as \"outstanding production\" at the time - will also become public, though it's often ranked among the worst of best picture winners.",
      "And after \"Steamboat Willie\" made the earliest Mickey Mouse public, a dozen more of his animations will get the same status, including \"The Karnival Kid,\" where he spoke for the first time.",
      "Songs from the last year of the Roaring Twenties are also about to become public property.",
      "Cole Porter's compositions \"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" and \"Tiptoe Through the Tulips\" are among the highlights, as is the jazz classic \"Ain't Misbehavin', written by Fats Waller and Harry Brooks.",
      "\"Singin' in the Rain,\" which would later forever be associated with the 1952 Gene Kelly film, made its debut in the 1929 movie \"The Hollywood Revue\" and will now be public domain.",
      "Different laws regulate sound recordings, and those newly in the public domain date to 1924. They include a recording of \"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen\" from future star and civil rights icon Marian Anderson, and \"Rhapsody in Blue\" performed by its composer, George Gershwin."

      "For 48-year-old Rowan Childs of Wisconsin, a recent divorce turned her financial life upside down.",
      "\"Initially, I was really nervous and had a lot of anxiety about it, but ultimately now I feel so much more empowered,\" Childs told CBS News.",
      "Like others in their 40s, Childs, who runs her own literacy nonprofit, was already anxious about juggling personal debt and putting away college tuition for her two children. She then joined the roughly half of married women around her age in the U.S. who have dealt with a divorce, a seismic event that can jeopardize retirement planning.",
      "\"That has completely changed my initial vision, you know?\" Childs said. \"...Where am I going to be in my 60s or my 70s or 80s?\"",
      "Childs said retirement wasn't necessarily something she thought about when she was first married.",
      "\"It was too far away, I think,\" Childs said. \"Definitely looking at what my parents were doing, though, was definitely something that I was observing.\"",

      "Ghilarducci explains that those two previous generations could at least bank on government-sponsored retirement programs.",
      "\"Two generations, because people had grandparents that were living through an expansion of Social Security and Medicare,\" Ghilarducci said.",
      "Both of those programs are now facing funding challenges, something Childs considered when she had to make a series of tough financial decisions. The costliest was to buy her ex-husband's share of their Wisconsin home by borrowing more than $100,000 from her 401(k).",
      "It was a decision partly spurred by the desire to keep her daughter in the same school district.",
      "\"To me, it didn't make sense to sell the house and then buy a house in the same school district, probably at even more,\" Childs said.",
      "Borrowing from a retirement plan, as Childs did, should be a last resort, because if you lose your job, the loan must be repaid in full or you may have to pay taxes and penalties. And if you're in your 40s, paying for a child's college should take a back seat to protecting your own savings. That may come across as tough love, but otherwise you might end up relying on your children later on.",
      "\"Jokingly, I told my kids I could move in with them,\" Childs said. \"\u2026My son was like, 'Well, maybe you could live close by.'\"",
      "The key in your 40s is to take deep breaths, regardless of the challenges.",
      "\"Relax,\" Ghilarducci said. \"Planning for retirement is best for the daylight hours, not in the middle of the night. And when you wake up, take some action steps. Worrying is not action.\"",
      "With plenty of time to get back on her feet, Childs says that she has finally stopped worrying.",

      "More than 400 tips were called into the New York Police Department's Crime Stoppers tip line during the five-day search for a masked gunman who fatally shot UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week.",
      "NYPD officials said about 30 of those tips were useful as information about the gunman's movements before and after\u00a0the Dec. 4 shooting. But it wasn't until a 911 call came in from a McDonald's employee in Altoona, Pennsylvania, on Monday that police zeroed in on their suspect. The FBI and the Crime Stoppers program have offered up to $60,000 to anyone with a tip leading to a break in the case.",
      "Police and prosecutors moved quickly to\u00a0arrest and charge\u00a0Luigi Mangione, 26, but it could take time before the McDonald's tipster gets a financial reward for assisting in the case. Additionally, the employee might not take home the full $60,000, after paying taxes on the reward. And if other tipsters played a role in leading cops to Mangione, they would also be eligible for a monetary reward, which could be drawn from the same pot of money.",
      "Exactly who will get the reward or a share of it is still being determined, officials said. In fact, the federal and local rewards programs operate under different rules. Both, however, have leeway built in to offer multiple rewards of varying amounts based on a tip's outcome.",
      "How does someone become eligible for a reward?",
      "The FBI reward program, which offered a reward of up to $50,000 in this case, requires that a tip or information lead to an arrest and conviction.",
      "Phone calls and emails to the FBI press office seeking details of the specific reward program's process were not returned, but websites for various rewards offered by the agency outline similar processes. A person giving a tip must be nominated, usually by a federal investigating agency. Then a board considers the tip and its role in the investigation, and decides whether to award up to the full amount.",
      "NYPD Crime Stoppers usually offers up to $3,500 for information that leads to an arrest and indictment. In this case, NYPD's Detective Bureau increased the amount to $10,000, and for its portion a conviction is required.",
      "\"The public's help is essential to solving crimes and keeping our communities safe,\" the Police Foundation board said in a statement Wednesday. \"The individual in Pennsylvania, who called in a tip, is eligible to receive the reward.\"",
      "The McDonald's employee called 911, which records a phone number and usually a name. Tipsters who call the Crime Stoppers line remain anonymous. The program promises to never trace cellphone numbers or record information about callers, instead giving them a unique identifier number that they can use to check back about the status of the case and the potential for a reward.",
      "NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny will assess which tip or tips were instrumental in cracking the case when determining how Detective Bureau reward funds should be allocated, police officials said Wednesday.",
      "30 different tips were helpful",
      "Most rewards require a conviction. Given the nature of the murder charges and the multiple jurisdictions involved, it could be a year or more before a trial happens.",
      "For the $3,500 from Crime Stoppers, the board could decide to issue reward money after the indictment is complete. Both the FBI and Crime Stoppers have boards that review the tips and determine which tips substantially helped a case. The boards can exercise discretion in determining how much money a tip might deserve.",
      "The Crime Stoppers board has the leeway to split a reward between tips or to consider each for the maximum amount on a case-by-case basis. NYPD officials did not specify how each of the 30 tips it said were deemed useful helped the case, but it's unlikely that each tipster would receive the highest amount offered.",
      "The police foundation and the FBI don't discuss individual cases or reveal how much money it awards individual tipsters. Similarly, the Crime Stoppers program doesn't release such details in an effort to protect tipsters' anonymity.",

    "story": [
      "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on Thursday issued a rule to limit bank and credit union lending fees that it says will save consumers $5 billion annually.",
      "The rule, which applies to the banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, gives these institutions three options: They can charge an overdraft fee of $5; charge a fee that covers their costs or losses; or continue to charge fees of any amount, so long as they disclose the terms of the overdraft loan and are compliant with lending laws.",
      "Banks can currently charge as much as they want in overdraft fees. On average, they charge around $35 each time a customer overdraws funds from their accounts, according to the CFPB.",
      "The CFPB expects the rule to save consumers $5 billion annually in overdraft fees, or $225 per household that pays overdraft fees.",
      "\"For far too long, the largest banks have exploited a legal loophole that has drained billions of dollars from Americans' deposit accounts,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement Thursday. \"The CFPB is cracking down on these excessive junk fees and requiring big banks to come clean about the interest rate they're charging on overdraft loans.\"",
      "The rule closes a legal loophole that allowed banks to bypass laws limiting how much they could charge consumers in overdraft fees. These fees have driven up consumer costs, and led to tens of millions of consumers losing access to banking services. Negative credit reporting has made it impossible for them to open other accounts, too, according to the CFPB.",
      "Banks are expected to challenge the rule, which is set to take effect in October 2025.",
      "It is part of the Biden Administration's pledge to crack down on so-called unreasonable bank \"junk fees.\" The U.S. Department of Transportation has also taken steps\u00a0to curb junk fees charged by airlines.",
      "The U.S. PIRG on applauded the CFPB's move, saying that previously banks had penalized those who could least afford to pay overdraft fees, and that the law protects their most vulnerable customers.",
      "\"In practice, overdraft fees have functioned as high-cost credit, so it only makes sense to regulate excessive fees as such. The CFPB's rule makes overdraft fees more reasonable and in line with the actual costs to banks,\" PIRG's Consumer Campaign Director Mike Litt said in a statement.",
      "National Economic Council director Lael Brainard said in a statement that \"for too long, excessive overdraft fees have saddled hardworking Americans with charges that really add up, preventing them from getting ahead.\"",
      "\"The CFPB's new rule, which caps overdraft fees as low as $5, is expected to save many families as much as $225 a year. That is real relief for families,\" she said.",
      "The banking industry, however, is expected to challenge the rule, which the American Bankers Association accuses of \"demonizing highly regulated and transparent bank fees.\" The advocacy group said the rule \"will make it significantly harder for banks to offer this valuable service to their customers, including those who have few other options to cover essential payments.\"",
      "TD Cowen analysts say they expect the rule to face legislative, regulatory and legal challenges. The savings to consumers will come at the expense of revenue for banks, particularly regional lending institutions, according to the analysts.",

      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",

The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",

If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",

      "The Canadian government said it was considering spending the equivalent of more than $700 million to better protect the border. In a bid to avert new U.S. tariffs, the plan would increase the number of officers and buy additional equipment, such as helicopters and drones, to tighten border crossings.",
      "Ford said his province, Canada's federal minister of finance and other provinces will put together a list of items on which the country could impose retaliatory tariffs against the U.S.",
      "\"We need to be ready to fight. This fight is 100% coming on Jan. 20 or Jan. 21,\" he said to reporters, referencing Trump's inauguration date, \"and we don't know to what extent this fight is going to go.\"",
      "Both Canada and U.S. would lose",
      "Analysts warn that dueling tariffs would harm both the U.S. and Canadian economies. Canada provides natural gas to the U.S. and roughly 20% of the crude oil used by its southern neighbor. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has forecast that U.S. gas prices could jump 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, shortly after Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "In 2023, Ontario also directly supplied electricity to 1.5 million U.S. homes and is a major exporter of power to Michigan, Minnesota and New York.",
      "Midwestern states in particular could face serious risks if Trump's plan for tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China goes into effect.\u00a0Michigan and Illinois rely heavily on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, which account for 19% and 12% of their state GDPs, respectively, according to analysts at Fitch Ratings Group. Michigan, which produces nearly 19% of vehicles sold in the U.S., particularly depends on cross-border trade. Meanwhile, Illinois, home to the fourth-largest crude oil refinery in the country, sources most of its crude oil from Canada.",
      "\"If enacted precisely as proposed, the broad tariffs proposed by President-elect Trump could pose a notable economic shock with tariff rates rising to levels not seen in the U.S. since the Great Depression,\" according to a recent analysis by Fitch.",
      "Experts also warn that stiff U.S. tariffs would likely push the Canadian economy into a recession in 2025, causing a spike in inflation and forcing the Bank of Canada to pause interest rate cuts next year. According to a recent report from Michael Davenport, an economist with Oxford Economics, Canada's energy, auto and heavy manufacturing sectors would be hit hardest because of the high degree of cross-border trade in these industries.",
      "\"25% U.S. tariffs along with proportional retaliatory tariffs would reduce Canada's exports and cause its GDP to fall 2.5% peak-to-trough by early-2026. Inflation would surge to 7.2% by mid-2025, and 150,000 layoffs would lift the unemployment rate to 7.9% by year-end,\" Davenport said.",
      "During his first term in office, Trump imposed tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum exports. Canada retaliated with its own duties on U.S products such as whiskey and yogurt coming from a plant in Wisconsin.",

    "summary": "In some U.S. states, more than 40% of residents report having to cut back on basic necessities to afford their electricity bill, survey finds.",
    "story": [
      "With the\u00a0cost of things\u00a0like food and housing still straining people's budgets, many U.S. households over the past year have found themselves having to pare their spending on basic necessities just to keep the lights on at home.",
      "That's according to a recent Lending Tree study which analyzed U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey data from Aug. 20, 2024 to Sep. 16, 2024 to find the percentage of Americans 18 and older that had cut back on necessary expenses to pay their energy bill, kept their home at an unsafe or unhealthy temperature, or was unable to pay the full amount on an energy bill at least once over the preceding 12 months.",
      "The study found that more than 34% of respondents said they have had to cut back or skip spending on certain necessary expenses at least once over the past year in order to pay their energy bill.",
      "\"Even though inflation has moderated in recent months, life is still crazy-expensive, and that can make it hard to pay your bills,\" Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst, said in the report. \"Lots of people have found themselves needing to make difficult decisions to keep the lights on. For some, that might mean cutting back on some expenses. For others, it might mean getting a side hustle or a second job.\"",
      "Electricity prices are on the rise. Is it inflation or an underlying issue?Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",

      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Hotter temperatures mean higher utility costs for millions of Americans",
      "Not surprisingly, households in poorer states are having a harder time keeping up with their electricity bill. In Alabama and Mississippi, more than 44% of residents reported having to make sacrifices to pay their utility bill, according to LendingTree. Eight of the top 11 states with the highest percentage of people struggling to pay energy bills are in the South, according to the report.",
      "\"Southern states tend to be low-income states, which means that each month can be a struggle,\" Schulz said. \"Add in that these are also low credit score states, and the predicament gets tougher.\"",
      "Adding to people's struggle is the rising cost of utilities. On average, in August Americans spent an average of $185.59 on electricity bills, according to LendingTree, a 2.6% increase from $180.82 in the same month a year ago. That said, residents in states with the highest energy rates don't necessarily pay the highest average monthly bills, according to the report, which found notable disparities in energy usage.",
      "For instance, Arizona, which has an average electricity rate of 42.10 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 14.7% below the national average of 16.63 cents, still has the second highest average monthly bill at $254.47, according to the report. Connecticut, which only has the third-highest electricity rate at 29.93 cents, or 109.7% above the national average, has the highest average monthly bill in the country, $254.47.",
      "Schulz expects both power costs and usage to continue increasing.",
      "\"For one, climate change and the\u00a0extreme weather that can come along with it may lead to greater usage, both in the heat of summer and the cold of winter,\" he said. \"Also, many utility companies are seeking to raise their rates in response to growing demand and other issues, and they're getting their way in many cases. It all adds up to some challenges for people with tight budgets.\"",

      "\"A modest delay in enforcing the Act will create breathing room for this Court to conduct an orderly review and the new Administration to evaluate this matter \u2014 before this vital channel for Americans to communicate with their fellow citizens and the world is closed,\" the emergency application said.",
      "TikTok has asked the Supreme Court for an injunction on an emergency basis but has not yet sought review on the merits of the case. In its application, TikTok said the company and its users will suffer \"immediate irreparable harm\" if the ban is not delayed.",
      "\"Congress's unprecedented attempt to single out Applicants and bar them from operating one of the most significant speech platforms in this Nation presents grave constitutional problems that this Court likely will not allow to stand,\" the filing said.",

      "TikTok and ByteDance asked the Supreme Court to make a decision on its request to delay the law by Jan. 6 so they can \"coordinate with their service providers to perform the complex task of shutting down the TikTok platform only in the United States\" if the justices decline.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law in May, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app. The petition said \"such a fundamental rearchitecting is not remotely feasible\" under the restrictions within the legislation.",
      "\"The platform consists of millions of lines of software code that have been painstakingly developed by thousands of engineers over multiple years,\" the petition said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump previously supported a ban but has since reversed his position, though several of his administration picks still back restricting the social media platform. Trump takes office a day after the law's implementation.",

      "I want to ask you a number of topics, but, before I go overseas, you sit on the House Intelligence Committee. You also, because of your new role, are in contact with President Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan.",
      "Do you think the public should be concerned about these reported drones all over the East Coast? And have you the need for more authority to deal with them?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, I think what the drone issue points out are kind of gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department.",
      "And I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from. And I can tell you, from the Defense Department standpoint, you know, they're focused on bombers and cruise missiles, and \u2013 and it's \u2013 it's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here.",
      "And we need to get to the bottom of it, and I think the Biden administration is \u2013 is working to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, at this point, given the intelligence you've seen, is there any reason for the public to be worried?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, look, when you have sensitive sites like Picatinny Arsenal, you have, of course, President Trump's residence at Bedminster, and you have other no-fly areas, those need to be enforced.",
      "We need to know who's behind it. But, right now, I think law enforcement seems to be \u2013 the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department are kind of all doing this and pointing at each other. So, when we come in, you know, how do we enforce these low-level, long-loitering, could-be-dangerous drones?",
      "And one thing for people to appreciate, you know, they're evolving so rapidly, it's not necessarily somebody that's just on the other end flying it. They could be following prepositioned GPS coordinates. They could be coming from offshore.",
      "And we need to take a hard look at our homeland defenses. President Trump has talked about an Iron Dome for America. That needs to include drones as well, not just adversarial actions like hypersonic missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "Let \u2013 let me ask you about China. The president-elect said a few things in the past week about China, and he said his team has been talking and discussing, as he put it, with China's President Xi Jinping.",
      "CBS was the first to report that an invitation was extended to the inauguration, though we do not expect Xi to come. Was that the extent of the back-and-forth? Do the two leaders intend to speak by phone?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, Margaret, it's been amazing.",
      "I mean, the entire world is reaching out to the president. In fact, it's been a little overwhelming, the outreach, not only to speak with him, to congratulate him, but to even come to the inauguration themselves. So, the outreach has been tremendous.",
      "President Trump is taking all calls. As you know, he believes in having a relationship with allies and adversaries at that kind of head-of-state level. And those conversations \u2013 those conversations are ongoing, but they are really nothing beyond congratulatory and niceties.",
      "We are in communication with the current administration. We don't agree on all things, but, as I have said before, none of our adversaries should think this is a moment to take advantage of this transition. We don't agree with all things, but we are in full coordination with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China, you said there should be consequences because of their massive and pervasive hack of eight U.S. telecom companies, which has breached the metadata of potentially millions of Americans.",
      "Senator Marco Rubio said it was egregious, dangerous, and a vulnerability that no one anticipated.",
      "You're going to be working together. What do you plan for the consequences to be?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Yes.",
      "I think Senator Rubio, and hopefully future Secretary of State Rubio, is absolutely right. We are \u2013 we have been over the years trying to play better and better defense when it comes to cyber.",
      "We need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation-state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that, even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.",
      "That is wholly unacceptable, and I think we need to take a much stronger stance. Senator Rubio is right. President Trump has indicated that as well. We need to start changing behaviors on the other side, rather than just constantly having this kind of escalation of their offense and our defense.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 us defend, but also making our adversaries vulnerable.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, I'm not going to get ahead of everything that we're doing day one.",
      "But taking a different approach to cyber, looking at our doctrine, and starting to impose costs on the other side to get them to knock this off is something we'll be taking a look at, I think.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Well, Orban has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump.",
      "And I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in Eastern Ukraine. I mean, Margaret, people need to understand\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Mr. Trump ask him to do that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: \u2026 this is World War I-style \u2013 this is World War I-style warfare. It is a meat grinder of human beings.",
      "President Trump's been very concerned about the carnage that's ongoing. And where is this all going?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of cease-fire as a first step, again, we'll \u2013 we'll take a hard look at what that means.",
      "But, until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, so no message was sent through Orban to Putin by Trump? Is that \u2013 that's what I understand you saying there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to \u2013 yes, I'm not going to get into specifics of back-and-forths.",

      "What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table? And what's the framework for \u2013 for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45-minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just \u2013 not just a pause?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Those are all things that we're thinking through.",
      "And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO secretary-general came here to Mar-a-Lago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: He's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in \u2013 whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East.",
      "During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014.",
      "President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. Thousands of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're, importantly, taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE WALTZ: And, you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained.",
      "So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR (D-Minnesota): Great to be back on, Margaret. Thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record, and you actually cosponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them.",
      "Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this? And why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe.",
      "However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency. And, three, I appreciated some of the congressman's words, because what he was talking about is, we need to have a \u2013 new regulatory rules in place here.",
      "Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half-pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities. And then we have got to figure out, do we really want all these drones?",
      "Because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future? And they have to be within 400 feet. So, these things are going to be, what, flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like, this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these.",
      "So, I think \u2013 I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be no one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Con \u2013 Republican controlled-Senate?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on, you sit on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "So you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration. And you will get to question his selectee to run the FBI, Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution.",

      "(Begin VT)",
      "SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI (R-Alaska): The approach is going to be, everybody, toe the line. Everybody, line up, we got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees.",
      "Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice.",
      "She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So, we have to do our due diligence and make decisions.",
      "I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here.",
      "And so, when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied \u2013 he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden, and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity.",
      "And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission, when we should be on a national security, safety mission here, when we look at cybersecurity attacks that you just talked to \u2013 with the congressman about and various other things.",
      "He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But, in the end, it's their decisions.",
      "Her demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own.",
      "I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1,500 Americans, more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so-called cash-for-kids scheme that sent thousands of kids to jail\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Did not like that one, no.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for millions of dollars.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: A man who committed tax fraud\u2026",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Mm-hmm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 at a cost of more than $1.6 billion, described as the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepentant tax cheat in U.S. history. A woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare.",
      "Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles, was also commuted.",
      "So, the way I look at this is, I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: I also have not agreed with the number of pardons that President Trump gave.",
      "So, I believe, and I have long advocated for this, that, while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the Army, things like that. That's been going on a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: But we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by.",
      "But a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: This makes no sense to me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is why it was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category, and not the specifics of the case.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: Exactly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that prudent?",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: And so I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group, OK, let's say that. I believe that there were.",
      "But there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So, instead of doing a whole category, why don't, in a coming year, before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them, based on the facts, instead of just in a large group?",
      "So, large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just \u2013 I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because, otherwise, you undermine the justice system.",
      "And, again, I emphasize\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: \u2026 this also happened in a big way under President Trump.",
      "And you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SENATOR AMY KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on. Thank you, Margaret.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the vice chairman of IBM, Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House economic adviser in President Trump's first term.",
      "Gary, welcome back.",
      "It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the president's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN (Former Director, White House National Economic Council): Margaret, thanks for having me.",
      "You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7 percent on consumer prices.",
      "Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: So we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2 percent, where the Fed would like to get to.",
      "That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly \u2013 it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points.",
      "Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically, as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "GARY COHN: So, the president's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth. We have real wage growth.",
      "And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GARY COHN: Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation.",
      "So, the economy the president's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And, in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America, is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive.",
      "Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You think that will actually happen?",
      "GARY COHN: I do think it's going to happen.",
      "So, net-net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: It's a \u2013 it's an index. It's a benchmark.",
      "And, remember, the stock market is an index.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: There's a \u2013 there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: \u2026 that are performing very, very well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: And there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it.",
      "Stay with us, Gary.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn.",
      "Gary, before the break you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So, you helped put together the tax plan that's - that's expiring in 20 - or part of it, sorry, expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21 percent. He really wanted to get it back down to 15. And we will be able to do that.",
      "Will he be able to do that?",
      "GARY COHN (Vice Chairman, IBM): Look, Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "GARY COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time, in 2025, you are given instructions by the - by the Budget Committee. And the instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you can take in. This time it will be how much money you can spend.",
      "We did not have additional money to spend. So, the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21 percent. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation 2017 expires the end of 2025. To score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025.",
      "So, we do know that taxes will be taken out by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation because if not the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants - on either side of the aisle wants to go back to the prior tax code.",
      "You know when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side because the vast majority of companies in - in the United States are small businesses that file in - on - on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate. And you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of - out of line with each other -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: So people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter s corporation versus a corporation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GARY COHN: So they can take advantage of the tax code. So, there's - there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure that the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you said in the past, though, you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "GARY COHN: Well, the business community as a whole. When we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the business roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21 percent tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23 percent or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Other developed economies?",
      "GARY COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domicile companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The pick for Treasury secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, Social Security, overtime pay.",
      "Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "GARY COHN: Look, Scott is a - quite an accomplished individual. So, the guy - I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies.",
      "There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these premises.",
      "GARY COHN: I agree with that. But we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the House speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote here. They're - they're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, do it in kind of an arcane way.",
      "When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "GARY COHN: Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and, look, I don't know, this could change any way. There's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy of this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which, you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Budget related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Which is border related. Where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes. Got it.",
      "GARY COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "GARY COHN: As there were in the Biden administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GARY COHN: Use that to - to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. That's a big fight to have in the year ahead.",
      "Gary, we'll be talking to you again then.",
      "We've got to take a break.",
      "GARY COHN: Thank you.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova.",
      "Good to have you back with us.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA (Ukrainian Ambassador to the United States): Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No western power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelenskyy said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, and - we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support.",
      "Yesterday we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the world about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already. And we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look, we - we see them now in (INAUDIBLE) only, and our great defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions.",
      "So, it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this access of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kusk (ph).",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in modern warfare and they're learning in Ukraine - I mean right there.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: And Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raise the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up the fight?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have - first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine. And they are volunteering. And women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces.",
      "With the recruitment, the last changes to the law of mobilization, already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Koreans who are unprepared, or Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us because every person matters for Ukrainians.",
      "Of course there are challenges. And we have the plan and we know how to do it because, again, this is our home we are defending. So, when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country. But weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3,000 glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us, those missiles, both Russian and North Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: I mean it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense most importantly. And the more we can have, the faster we can - the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I - the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone, but Donald Trump gave an interview to \"Time Magazine\" and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons - missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Well, let me say - start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually to provide us with lethal aid in the first place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back in 2017.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. So, right now we have to do everything in order to stop Russia, and we know it's - it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50 percent that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could - they - they - we can stop them. The more equipment we have, especially including the longer-range equipment, in order to be able to degrade their attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table because, again, Ukraine wants peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict. And we negotiated at the first sight, remember in 2022 when Russians started negotiations. They, of course, did not negotiated peace. They negotiated the pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be. But we do know that Viktor Orbon was at Mar- a-Lago this past week and he talks to Vladimir Putin and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter. After Russia destroyed our - a lot of our energy infrastructure and after, you know, we are going through this difficult fight, both on the front line but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just this past week.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: Yes. At the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying.",
      "And we see they were not able to defend their buddy - terrorist buddy Assad and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Saydnaya prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: It reminded me, isolation prison in Denesk, which still is operational.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "OKSANA MARKAROVA: So, look, you know, if Russia wants seriously to stop it, they can stop it at any time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "Ambassador, I have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us.",

And just like that, the fear of saying something that might get you arrested was gone. The Islamist fighters who had seized power a week ago were partying, too. In the main suuk (ph), shoppers walked on Assad's face. While at Saydnaya Prison, where his critics were tortured and killed, crowds poured in to what Syrians used to call the slaughterhouse.",

      "CINDY MCCAIN (Executive Director, U.N. World Food Programme): Well, our deliveries so far have been very - very smooth. But we need more delivery options open, which is what this was eluding to.",
      "More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this - this month so far, but we need more. And - and, more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking.",
      "You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there. But now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get not just more trucks but more people in so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not really. We've - we've been able to, as - as you said, we've been able to move our goods through our food items, et cetera, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But - but I - I don't - I will never under state - under - under estimate the process with things that could - it could infringe us later on. So, I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods, again, in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now if you want to know the truth. There's so much - there's so many - many countries that have absolutely no access to any funding, no one's paying any - any attention to it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Yes, countries are - are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. And I'm asking now. I'm asking on your show worldwide to please consider once again giving to Syria because people in Syria will starve to death without it. And - and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game. And you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide.",
      "Have you seen any change to that?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody.",
      "The world is on fire right now, and hunger - hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide. And it does affect national security. So, it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We - right now we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where - where famine does exist. As you know, it's been declared there. And we need - we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can - can access from that direction as well.",
      "It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in. But we need more. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that. Because if people are insecure from a food - from a food reality, they're not going to behave well. And things - they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's national security adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's - what's going on.",
      "Listen, this - we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know, and, of course, now we're into December. This whole - this while issue of not being able to get in is - is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire. And we need it now. We can't - there's - we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of - of crowds just crushing people amassing at bakeries in Gaza. Ninety percent of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is manmade.",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: It is manmade. You're absolutely right, it is manmade. And - and, more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just \u2013 not just do they need food, but we need access. And that targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job. And - and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. People - children especially are starving to death. I mean the height of malnutrition, the height of hunger within - within that region is - is unbelievably horrible. And so we've seen be it firsthand. And I - I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are - I'm calling for a ceasefire. And I want my aid - my fellow partners within this arena to call for the same thing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "CINDY MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running - if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the lawlessness.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of need you're looking for. Seventeen billion is the number you are asking for.",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Gary Cohn, IBM vice chairman and first Trump administration economic adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Gary, and we're back now with the Vice Chairman of IBM Gary Cohn, who also served as the White House Economic Advisor in President Trump's first term. Gary, welcome back. It's expected the Fed is going to cut rates again this week, even though we did see in the economic data released that inflation is still high. President Trump said, can't lower prices once they're high. Seems to be admitting that it's not within the President's remit to control what you spend at the grocery store.",
      "GARY COHN: \u00a0 Margaret, thanks for having me. You're right. So we had two bits of economic data this week. We had consumer prices and we've had producer prices. Both came in on the high side of where economists were hoping. If you look at the consumer prices, we're looking at about 2.7% on consumer prices. Remember, the Fed's target for inflation is about 2%, so we're running almost a percent high. Producer prices came in even higher than we were expecting. So we're not down to that target 2% where the Fed would like to get to. That said, the Fed meting next week. The Fed is highly- it's highly viewed that the Fed will cut interest rates by 25 basis points next week. That means, over the course of this year, they will have cut interest rates by 100 basis points. Now, as you look forward into next year, people had projected they would cut a lot more. I think we are seeing the rate of cuts slow down, and slow down quite dramatically as people are starting to evaluate the economic data that we have.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So what does that mean in terms of the economy President Trump will be inheriting?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 So the President's inheriting a very good economy, a very stable economy. We have real, solid economic growth. We have real job growth, we have real wage growth. And I think some of the wage growth that we're seeing, we've seen a lot of these union contracts be renegotiated in the second half of this year. Those wages feed through the economy. They feed through as inflation. So the economy the President's inheriting is quite strong. I think it will continue to stay quite strong. And in fact, the American consumer today, as well as corporate America is quite excited about what the Trump administration is talking about, and the business environment is very positive. Corporate America is talking about a lot of expansion, a lot of capital expenditure for next year, about repatriating more jobs back to the United States, about building more factories in the United States, hiring more workers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think that will actually happen?",
      "COHN: I do think it's going to happen. So net, net, we are talking about a very positive business and cycle going forward into 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the stock market really the best way to gauge it? You saw Mr. Trump at the stock exchange this past week.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, look, the stock market is one benchmark. It's a- it's an index, it's a benchmark. And remember, the stock market is an index. There's a- there's a huge diversity of what's going on in the stock market. There's some of the tech stocks at the high end that are performing very, very well, and there's some of the more traditional stocks in the middle of the market that are not performing as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 We've got to take a break and finish this conversation on the other side of it. Stay with us.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We're continuing our conversation now with Gary Cohn. Gary, before the break, you were telling us the business world has high expectations for the Trump administration. One of the things that Donald Trump promised to do in his second term was lower the corporate tax rate. So you helped put together the tax plan that's expiring in 20- or part of it expiring in 2025. He said at the New York Stock Exchange this week that he wants it to go down further from 21%. He really wanted to get it back down to 15 and \"we will be able to do that.\" Will he be able to do that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look Margaret, we don't know. You know, look, the whole tax discussion is going to happen over the course of 2025--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why didn't you do it in 2017?",
      "COHN: In 2017 we did not have the financial wherewithal to do it. When you go through reconciliation, which is how they will do taxes this time in 2025, you are given instructions by the- by the Budget Committee, They instructions are basically how much money you can spend or how much revenue you could take in. This time, it will be how much money you can spend. We did not have additional money to spend, so the lowest we could get the corporate tax rate at that time was the 21%. That's also the reason that the corporate tax part of the tax legislation in 2017 expires the end of 2025, to score that piece of legislation, which in the financial requirements we were given by the Senate and the House Finance Committees, we had to end the personal side at the end of 2025. So we do know that taxes will be taken up by this Congress in this session. We know that they're going to have to deal with the personal side of the equation, because if not, the personal side will revert back to the pre-2017 tax code. That was a very arduous, ugly tax code with much higher rates, with a lot more loopholes, a lot more deductions. I don't think anyone wants, on either side of the aisle, wants to go back to the prior tax code. You know, when we open up tax code, even if we're just talking about the personal side, the corporate side will come into play. And there's always this interesting relationship between the personal side and the corporate side, because the vast majority of companies in the United States are small businesses that file on a tax return that allows them to pay the personal rate. But there's a difference between the personal rate and the corporate rate, and you want to make sure that those relationships don't get too far out of out of- out of line with each other, so people aren't incentivized to change their corporate structure to become a subchapter S corporation versus a corporation, so they can take advantage of the tax code. So there's always a lot of time spent there to make sure the personal rate and the corporate rate makes sense in relationship to each other.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 I think you've said in the past, though you don't think the corporate rate should go down further.",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, the business community as a whole, when we did tax reform in 2017, and whether you look at the Chamber of Commerce, or you look at the Business Roundtable, you look at any of the business organizations, they were very supportive of a 21% tax rate. They, in fact, I think, would have been happy with anything at 23% or below, which put us in line with other OECD countries around the world. It made us competitive--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN::: Other developed economies.",
      "COHN: Other developed economies. Obviously, companies will be happier if the tax rate goes lower, but realistically, we just need, in this country, to be competitive with the rest of the world. We do not want corporate taxes to be a disadvantage for U.S. domiciled companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 The pick for Treasury Secretary is hedge fund manager Scott Bessent. You may know him. He says he's going to deliver on the Trump tax cut pledges, but that's eliminating taxes on tips, social security, overtime pay. Can he actually deliver on any of that?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Look, Scott is quite an accomplished individual. So look, I know he will put a lot of effort into this. He will have a lot of help with other people. Kevin Hassett, who's going into my old job at the NEC, will have an important seat at the table. Kevin understands a lot of these policies. There will be a lot of opinions at the table when we get to tax writing. You know, the House and the Senate will have their opinions. Remember, there are members of the House that ran on one item and one item only. They ran on the idea that we should bring back the state and local tax deduction, the SALT deduction. There were also members that ran on being deficit hawks. There were Republicans that ran on thinking that we have built up too much deficit and we need to get our budget under control. We're going to have to find a way--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're not going to like any of these promises--",
      "COHN: I agree with that, but we're going to have to find a way to balance all of these needs and get to a tax plan that makes sense but allows us to continue to drive our economy, continue to drive the economic growth and continue to drive wages and jobs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Well, you heard the House Speaker say some of this may be done through reconciliation, which implies that the Senate isn't going to seek a majority vote. They're just going to try to put this through with 51 votes, and do it in kind of an arcane way. When is this going to happen? And should it happen before they fix the border?",
      "COHN: \u00a0 Well, it sounds like, from what I'm hearing, and I don't know, this could change anyway, there's other people smarter than I deciding on the strategy on this. It sounds like there may be two reconciliation bills. It sounds like the first reconciliation bill, which you're right, is a bill that allows the Senate to do something in a simple majority, budget-related only. You can only reconcile a budget. Budget related with a simple majority. It sounds like there may be a first reconciliation bill, which is border related, where they may take back much of the unspent Inflation Reduction Act money and some of the other money that was appropriated under the Biden administration, and use that to close the border.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And then they'll get to taxes?",
      "COHN: And then use a second reconciliation bill, because there are two budgets out there, as there were in the Biden administration, use that to go after taxes and fixing taxes, especially the personal side of taxes that ends in 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 That's a big fight to have in the year ahead. Gary, we will be talking to you again, then. We've got to take a break. Thank you."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Minnesota Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar. Good to have you here.",
      "SEN. AMY KLOBUCHAR: Great to be back on Margaret, thanks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Senator, I do want to ask you about these drones on the East Coast, because we looked at your record and you actually co-sponsored legislation a few years ago trying to expand authorities to deal with them. Why do you need an act of Congress to deal with this, and why didn't the Democrats move on it?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, first of all, the administration has repeatedly assured people that they are safe. However, one, we need a briefing for the members of the Senate to figure out what's going on here. Two, we need more transparency and three, I appreciated some of the Congressman's words, because what he is talking about is we need to have a new regulatory rules in place here. Right now, you have to register a drone if it's over a half pound, and there are penalties if you don't do that. Well, I think we have to make sure that regime is enforced with local and state authorities, and then we've got to figure out, do we really want all these drones, because while these may be safe, who knows what happens in the future, and they have to be within 400 feet, so these things are going to be what? Flying over people's family picnics and over their homes and over beaches? Like this is not going to be a good future if we see too many of these. So I think I was pleased that he said he wanted to move forward on some rules and finding a way to regulate these in a better way, because this just can't be. No one knows why this huge drone is right over their house.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you might bring this up in the new Republican controlled Senate?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Moving on. You sit on the Judiciary Committee, so you're going to have a key role in overseeing law enforcement under the Trump administration, and you'll get to question his selectee to run the FBI Kash Patel, who has published in his book a list of enemies, vowed retribution. I want to play something for you that Republican Senator Murkowski said just a few days ago.",
      "SEN. LISA MURKOWSKI: The approach is going to be, everybody toe the line. Everybody line-up. We got you here, and if you want to survive, you better be good. Don't get on Santa's naughty list here, because we will primary you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That is a remarkable thing for a Republican senator to say on the record, as clearly as she said. She said they are being threatened if they don't get in line and vote for some of these nominees. Are you getting the sense from your Republican colleagues on judiciary they will get in line and vote through Kash Patel?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Sadly, there is some of that going on, but then you have other people, like Lisa Murkowski, who has always been a thoughtful, independent voice. She believes her job is to do what our Constitution tells us, advice and consent, and also that we take an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. So we have to do our due diligence and make decisions. I voted for a number of the past Trump nominees for many different jobs. I looked at them and decided if I thought they were qualified, and could they perform the mission of the agency, and did they have integrity? That's what has to happen here. And so when you look at someone like Kash Patel, who would be replacing Christopher Wray, who I believe embodied- he was a Trump appointee, went through Biden and embodied the mission of the FBI, which is fidelity, bravery, integrity. And so now you have someone who says he's on a revenge mission when we should be on a national security safety mission here, when we look at cyber security attacks that you just talked to the congressman about and various other things. He says he wants to dismantle the FBI headquarters and turn it into a museum. To me, this is not the direction we need to go. So I appreciate Senator Murkowski's words and also her demand and other Republicans. It's going to be their decisions on these nominees. We may vote against them or for them, but in the end, it's their decision to demand for FBI reports and making sure that these are not recess appointments and there must be open hearings.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right because they have enough votes, essentially, to move on these on their own. I want to ask you about President Biden. This past week, he had this record number of commutations, 1500 Americans more than any president in any single day. Among them, though, there was a judge involved in a so called \"Cash for kids\" scheme\u2013",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I did not like that one. Nope.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013that sent thousands to jail for millions of dollars, a man who committed tax fraud at a cost of more than $1.6 billion described as \"the most prolific, pernicious, utterly unrepented tax cheat in U.S. history,\" a woman who was involved in a $26 million scheme to defraud Medicare. Are you comfortable with some of these decisions?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: No. There's also a man in Duluth that was running a major drug house, basically, and had all this money under his bathroom tiles was also commuted. So the way I look at is this- I also didn't agree with the pardon of the president's son. I also have not agreed with a number of pardons that President Trump gave. So I believe, and I've long advocated for this, that while the pardon ability is part of our Constitution, we're not going to change that right? Go way back to President Lincoln, who made hard decisions himself about deserters from the army, things like that. That's been going on a long time, but we should have some kind of an outside board that governors have. Governors have the ability to give mercy to people after years have gone by, but a lot of them have boards that make recommendations and other things, instead of people just doing it in the middle of the night and people in the White House. This makes no sense to me\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, this is what was so surprising, because the White House described it as just based on a broad category and not the specifics of the case. Was that prudent?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Exactly. And so, I have no doubt there were some righteous pardons in this group. Okay, let's say that. Now I believe that there were, but there were a number that I think make no sense at all. So instead of doing a whole category, why don't in a coming year before the end of a president's term, if that's when they're mostly going to do these, that a board looks at these and looks at them individually, when people petition for them based on the facts, instead of just in a large group. So large groups have been done before, I believe, but I just, I think that this whole process cries out for reform, because otherwise you undermine the justice system. And again, I emphasize, this also happened in a big way under President Trump, and you undermine the work of these line FBI agents, these line prosecutors who have taken on these cases, followed the sentencing guidelines and made a decision. Might you want mercy 10 years later? Yes, you might. But let's at least look at these on a factual basis and a risk basis, instead of just in the middle of the night a month before a president leaves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Klobuchar, thank you for being here today.",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: It was great to be on Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with a lot more face than nation. Stay with us."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. Michael Waltz, Republican of Florida, Trump's pick for national security adviser, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Dec. 15, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin with Congressman Mike Waltz of Florida, who is the incoming White House National Security Adviser. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ (R-FL): Morning. Margaret. Tough day for Army, but great day for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Indeed. Well as a Green Beret, I know you had a reason to be cheering there for Army, Sir. I want to ask you a number of topics, but before I go overseas, you sit on the House Intelligence Committee. You also, because of your new role, are in contact with President Biden's National Security Adviser, Jake Sullivan. Do you think the public should be concerned about these reported drones all over the East Coast? And have you the need for more authority to deal with them?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I think what the drone issue points out are kind of gaps in our agencies, gaps in our authorities between the Department of Homeland Security, local law enforcement, the Defense Department. And I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from. And I can tell you, from the Defense Department standpoint, you know, they're focused on bombers and cruise missiles, and- and it's- it's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here. And we need to get to the bottom of it, and I think the Biden administration is- is working to do that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But at this point, given the intelligence you've seen, is there any reason for the public to be worried?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, look, when you have sensitive sites like Picatinny Arsenal, you have, of course, President Trump's residence at Bedminster, and you have other no-fly areas, those need to be enforced. We need to know who's behind it. But right now, I think law enforcement seems to be- the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department are kind of all doing this and pointing at each other. So when we come in, you know, how do we enforce these low level, long loitering, could-be-dangerous drones? And one thing for people to appreciate, you know, they're evolving so rapidly, it's not necessarily somebody that's just on the other end flying it. They could be following pre-positioned GPS coordinates. They could be coming from offshore. And we need to take a hard look at our homeland defenses. President Trump has talked about an Iron Dome for America. That needs to include drones as well, not just adversarial actions like hypersonic missiles. We need to have an all of the above protection of U.S. airspace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. Let- let me ask you about China. The President Elect said a few things in the past week about China, and he said his team has been \"talking and discussing,\" as he put it, with China's President Xi Jinping. CBS was the first to report that an invitation was extended to the inauguration, though we do not expect Xi to come. Was that the extent of the back and forth? Do the two leaders intend to speak by phone?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Margaret, it's been amazing. I mean, the entire world is reaching out to the president. In fact, it's been a little overwhelming, the outreach, not only to speak with him, to congratulate him, but to even come to the inauguration themselves. So the outreach has been tremendous. President Trump is taking all calls, as you know. He believes in having a relationship with allies and adversaries at that kind of head of state level. And those conversations- those conversations are ongoing, but they are, really, nothing beyond congratulatory and niceties. We are in communication with the current administration. We don't agree on all things, but as I've said before, none of our adversaries should think this is a moment to take advantage of this transition. We don't agree with all things, but we are in full coordination with the current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, China, you said there should be consequences because of their massive and pervasive hack of eight U.S. telecom companies, which has breached the metadata of potentially millions of Americans. Senator Marco Rubio said it was egregious, dangerous, and a vulnerability that no one anticipated. You're going to be working together. What do you plan for the consequences to be?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ\u00a0 I think Senator Rubio, and hopefully future Secretary of State Rubio, is absolutely right. We are- we have been, over the years, trying to play better and better defense when it comes to cyber. We need to start going on offense and start imposing, I think, higher costs and consequences to private actors and nation state actors that continue to steal our data, that continue to spy on us, and that even worse, with the Volt Typhoon penetration, that are literally putting cyber time bombs on our infrastructure, our water systems, our grids, even our ports.That is wholly unacceptable, and I think we need to take a much stronger stance. Senator Rubio is right. President Trump has indicated that as well. We need to start changing behaviors on the other side, rather than just constantly having this kind of escalation of their offense and our defense. The Colonial Pipeline hack was another key point. And then finally, we've got a tremendous private sector with a lot of capability. That relationship between public and private, with our tech industry, they could be doing a lot of good and helping\u2014",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is this sanctions?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: \u2014us defend, but also making our adversaries vulnerable.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it sanctions day one from the Trump administration?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, I'm not going to get ahead of everything that we're doing day one, but taking a different approach to cyber, looking at our doctrine, and starting to impose costs on the other side to get them to knock this off, is something we'll be taking a look at, I think.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You were at Mar a Lago this past week when Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, met with Mr. Trump and Elon Musk and yourself. He then announced that he had spoken to Vladimir Putin. Orb\u00e1n seems to be floating a Christmas ceasefire and a prisoner swap. Is he carrying with him some kind of message from Donald Trump?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, Orb\u00e1n has regular engagement with the Russians, and he clearly has a good relationship with President Trump, and I would hope the entire world would want to see some type of cessation to the slaughter that is happening in eastern Ukraine. I mean, Margaret, people need to understand\u2014",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did Mr. Trump ask him to do that?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style-",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: This is World War I style warfare. It is a meat grinder of human beings. President Trump's been very concerned about the carnage that's ongoing. And where is this all going?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: We need to stop the fighting. And, you know, look, if that is some type of ceasefire as a first step, again, we'll- we'll take a hard look at what that means. But until January 20, we are also in coordination with this current administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so no message was sent through Orb\u00e1n to Putin by Trump. Is that- that's what I understand you saying there.",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Oh, I'm not going to- yeah, I'm not going to get into specifics of back and forths. But, one is talking, of course, we're going to continue to talk, and the- President Trump's made it clear he wants this war to stop.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does the Trump team plan to limit how Ukraine can use U.S. weapons or targeting assistance when you take office?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, President Trump just said in the interview that, you know, a blank check, in his interview with Time magazine, I believe, you know, a blank check isn't- you know, just isn't a strategy. This just, kind of, forever war that we seem to be backing into. What does success look like in line with our interests? How do we end the war? Who's at the table? How do we drive, you know, all sides to the table, and what's the framework for- for an agreement? Those are things that we're thinking through with his fantastic team that he's assembling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Was that discussed in that 45 minute meeting that Mr. Trump had with Mr. Zelenskyy in Paris last week? And do you support putting NATO member states as peacekeepers in Ukraine?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Well, you know what's been so interesting, Margaret, is, just since the election, everyone coming to us, our European allies, President Zelenskyy in that meeting, and others, have shifted to how to- that framework I just talked about. How do we end this conflict? How do we do it in a way that restores stability, stops the carnage, and hopefully makes this a permanent end, not just- not just a pause? Those are all things that we're thinking through. And in terms of the question you just asked, the NATO Secretary General came here to Mar a Lago, he's talking about the Europeans taking a bigger role in- whether that's on the ground or otherwise, after this conflict is over, and that's exactly what President Trump has been asking for.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I have to quickly ask you about the Middle East. During the last Trump administration, Donald Trump pulled some U.S. troops out of Syria. Does he intend to keep the 900 U.S. troops there?",
      "REP. MIKE WALTZ: Look, our number one interest is keeping a lid on ISIS. We cannot have an explosion of ISIS back into a caliphate that threatens Iraq, threatens Jordan, threatens Turkey and Europe, inspires attacks in the United States, like we saw in 2014. President Trump cleaned it up then with his team. 1000s of ISIS fighters are in prison camps. We're in consultation with the Israelis as well. They're importantly taking down Assad's chemical stockpiles, as well as other things we don't want falling into the hands of anybody. And you know, the other piece there that he asked for in the first term, and that we need to see is, again, Europe, who was hit so badly by ISIS attacks, taking a greater role in keeping ISIS contained. So those are all conversations that we're having, again, in consultation with the current administration, and we'll see moving forward.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Executive Director of the U.N.'s World Food Programme Cindy McCain. Welcome back to Face the Nation.",
      "U.N. WORLD FOOD PROGRAMME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR CINDY MCCAIN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director, you are looking at a globe very much in crisis, but I want to start on the hot spot of Syria. USAID said the World Food Programme was able to reach 70,000 people in Syria over the last week, but you need supply lines to remain open. Is there a threat right now to your deliveries? And if so, where is that coming from?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, our deliveries so far have been very- very smooth, but we need more delivery options open, which is what this was alluding to. More importantly, we have been able to get 70,000 people fed this- this month so far, but we need more. And- and more importantly, we need the funds to do it. That's where we're lacking. We had- there's a lot of people, a lot of hunger at stake, a lot of malnutrition that was already pre-existing, that now- that now we need to handle as well. You know, WFP never left Syria. We've always been in there, but now we need more routes, more ability to get in and to get, not just more trucks, but more people in, so that we can help in the best way we can.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you need Turkey to open up supply lines or surrounding countries? Is that right?",
      "MCCAIN: Yes, correct. We need everybody around us, Turkey, all the countries surrounding us, to make sure that we can get in and get in smoothly, again, unfettered and, of course, in a safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you have said you're trying to scale up to reach nearly 3 million people who need some help right now. The U.S. still has some sanctions on Syria, but they do let in U.N. humanitarian aid. There was a call in Congress, a bipartisan one this week, for the United States to lift some sanctions. Are you experiencing U.S. sanctions getting in your way at this point?",
      "MCCAIN: Not really. We've- we've been able to, as- as you said, we've been able to move our goods, through, our food items, etc, through and get it to where it needs to go in a safe and quick manner as well. But- but I don't- I will never understate- underestimate the process with things that it could infringe us later on. So I'm hoping that things stay calm, that we can move our goods again in a safe and secure manner and do it at full scale. If we can't work at scale, we can't feed. And that's the most important part that we need too, we need access, and we need the ability to feed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you said you're short on funds. How much do you need?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, worldwide, I could use 17 billion right now, if you want to know the truth. There's so much, there's so many- many countries that have absolutely no access to any fundings. No one's paying any attention to it. Syria being one of them. And we need- we need, obviously, a great deal of funds in- in particular within Syria, but in other countries too. You're talking about Sudan, we're talking about Yemen, we're talking about Ethiopia and other places where- where people are desperate right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So why did you say funding is down? People are just not paying attention?",
      "MCCAIN: Yeah. Yeah. Countries are- are rerouting their funding in different ways. They're choosing- choosing to fund things in different manners or not to fund at all. We- you know, we- I always send out the oral plea to be able to- to encourage people and encourage countries to be- to get involved and to stay involved. And I'm asking now, I'm asking on your show, worldwide, to please consider, once again, giving to Syria, because people in Syria will starve to death without it, and- and we've seen the evidence of great hunger there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, you and I have spoken in the past on this program about the U.S. contributing so generously to the U.N., the largest funder, arguably the most important partner to the United Nations, and you had encouraged Beijing to really kind of step up their game, and you had said there was somewhat of a lack of willingness to be a part of working together as a team worldwide. Have you seen any change to that?",
      "MCCAIN: Not much. I encourage all countries to get involved, including China. We need help from everybody. The world is on fire right now, and hunger- hunger is at the forefront of all of this. And most importantly, you know, when people are hungry, this becomes a national security issue. And so it affects not only the countries that it's affecting, but it affects us worldwide, and it does affect national security. So it's important that every country worldwide get involved and be involved in this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S., as- as we just said, the most generous here, the president-elect has selected a rising star in the Republican Party, Elise Stefanik, to be the representative at the United Nations, and also a cabinet member. That indicates an important voice at the table. Congressman Stefanik- Congresswoman Stefanik called for a complete reassessment of U.S. funding for the United Nations. Are you concerned that you will see a negative impact on funding?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, I'm not concerned, because when I came into this job, I knew that funding was not going to be at the level that it had been. So we've gone through a complete- complete reboot on not only scaling down our operations and making sure that we're more efficient, more effective, and- and making sure that our people in- we push everything to this- to the- to the field now, so that our people in the field can get the job done. We- this was something I came in knowing I was going to have to do, is scale down, make sure that- that we work better, more efficiently, more effectively, and make sure that we get food to the people that need it the most in a quick and safe manner.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I want to ask you about Sudan. I know you were recently there. It's in the midst of a brutal civil war. The U.S. has accused both sides of ethnic cleansing. Can you keep trucks going into Sudan to feed people there?",
      "MCCAIN: Oh, it's such a complicated situation. We- right now, we have 30 some convoys on the road going into Sudan to hit the various places that we need to get to, but we need more. Certainly, Darfur has been a big issue, but we have other parts of the country that are just as needy and where- where famine does exist, as you know, it's been declared there. And we need- we need also to be able to come through Khartoum and make sure that we can- can access from that direction as well. It's been a slow process, but we have been able to get in, but we need more. People are starving to death, and once again, it's- it's- I sound like a broken record, but we need to be able to get in in a safe and unfettered- unfettered manner, so that we can get the job done. Again, food security is national security. Don't ever forget that because if people are insecure from a food- from- from a food reality, they're not going to behave well, and things- they start to migrate. Wars begin that way. Conflict is a part of all of this. The countries that are affected right now, and the big ones that we- that we look to, are all affected because of conflict. It's- the food security issue is- is very directly caused by conflict within the arena that they're in. So it's very important that we pay attention to that particular issue as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN Given the- the scale of the famine and the malnutrition in Sudan, is it food that you're trying to bring in, or is it more, you know, specialized medical assistance? How do you deal with the children, for example, who are being so hurt in Sudan?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, yes, part of that is making sure that- that our folks from UNICEF, our folks from W.H.O. can get in because there are specialized and- specialized products that are needed for, especially the infants, that are so severely- severely malnourished. And it's our job to help not just get our stuff in, but get their stuff in as well, in any way that we can. We're a team player in all this, and we make sure that we- we access and talk to all of our partners within the field so that we can work together. Yes. I mean, these are these- these people, and these children especially, have been so deprived of nourishment for so long that they need highly-specialized items to be able- to be able to beat malnutrition and at least have some chance at life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'd be remiss to not ask you about what's going on in Gaza. Jake Sullivan, President Biden's National Security Adviser, said this week the U.S. has stood up to Prime Minister Netanyahu to say, let's make sure that Israel is not responsible for the third famine of the 21st century. Are we at famine in Gaza?",
      "MCCAIN: We're very close to it. We've seen the effects of it. We've seen what's- what's going on. Listen- this- we're in the month of November. WFP has been able to get two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks in the month of November. And, you know- and of course, now we're into December. But so- the- the- the inability for us to not only to- to move our trucks and get it to where it needs to go, but the insecurity that's caused from it, the- the- the targeting of- of humanitarian aid workers and making sure that we can't move or that- or that they feel insecure. This whole- this whole issue of not being able to get in, is- is unseemly. We need unfettered access. We need a cease-fire, and we need it now. We can't- there's- we can no longer sit by and just allow these people to starve to death. We need help, and we need to make sure that we put political pressure on those that need to have political pressure put on them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We've seen images of- of crowds just crushing people, amassing at bakeries in Gaza. 90% of the population cannot return to their homes. They're displaced. Only four bakeries are operational for nearly 2 million people. This is man-made.",
      "MCCAIN: It is man-made, you're- you're absolutely right. It is man-made and and- and more importantly, the world needs to take a hard look at this and realize that not just- not just do they need food, but we need access. And the targeting of humanitarian aid workers is unconscionable. We need to get in and do our job, and- and more importantly, in all of this, make sure that we can feed. Children, especially, are starving to death. I mean, the height of malnutrition, the height of- of hunger within- within that region, is- is unbelievably horrible, and so we've seen it firsthand. And I- I, as the leader of the largest humanitarian aid agency in the world, are- I'm calling for a cease-fire, and I want my aid, my fellow partners within this arena, to call for the same thing. We need a cease-fire. We need access, and we need it now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You used the word--",
      "MCCAIN:\u00a0 -- Again, remember, food security is national security, and that's what's happening.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood. You used the word targeted. Who's targeting your workers?",
      "MCCAIN: Well, there's lots of things that are going on there. There's gangs that are running, if we're speaking directly about Gaza, it's gangs that's running around. It's the- the lawlessness. There is absolutely no- no law- law to be held, you know, to be even talked about there, because it doesn't exist. And so we need all of those kinds of things to be put into place so that we can work in a safe manner and get- get the food to where it's go- where it needs to go. Again, we've gotten two trucks in. That's all. Two trucks.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Director McCain, I know you have a lot of needs. You're looking for 17 billion is the number you are asking for. We wish you good luck feeding the world.",
      "MCCAIN: Thank you. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova. Good to have you back with us.",
      "UKRAINIAN AMBASSADOR TO THE U.S. OKSANA MARKAROVA: Thank you for having me and blessed Sunday to all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No Western Power, as you know, is sending troops to Ukraine to help Ukrainian forces, but Russia's got North Korean troops now who are fighting on their side. Yesterday, President Zelensky said Russia has been using a significant number of North Koreans. How are they fighting?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes, so and we are not asking for other troops. Ukrainians are still capable of defending our own country. We're asking for the military support. Yesterday, we have seen those tens of thousands of troops that we were warning the word about. We have seen hundreds of them on the battlefield already, and we are successfully fighting with them as we are fighting with the Russians. I mean, look we we see them now in Kursk Oblast only, and our brave defenders were not only able to kill a lot of them, but also keep the positions. So it's difficult, of course, to see the reinforcement from this axis of evil, but it will not change anything for us. We will continue defending the very long line, whether it's in southern eastern Ukraine or whether it's our defensive operation in Kursk.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in the meantime, the North Korean troops are getting trained in Modern Warfare, and they're learning in Ukraine- I mean, right there.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Absolutely. And we also have to worry about what is it that Russia is promising or even delivering to North Korea in exchange for this and Korean missiles.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But I also raised the manpower issue because it's a problem for Ukraine as well. Military Recruitment is tough right now in Ukraine. There has been pressure on your government by the United States to lower the draft age so that you can boost the number of fighters. This is arguably a bigger issue than the weaponry itself. Is it affecting the ability of Ukraine to keep up this fight?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: I wouldn't agree that it's a bigger issue than the equipment itself. We still have, first of all, we have a number of young people fighting for Ukraine, and they are volunteering, and women are volunteering. Ukraine is one of the countries that lifted all restrictions for women, for example, and we have 60,000 of women in the armed forces. With the recruitment, the last changes to the law on mobilization already allowed us to create new brigades, which we are training now. And the problem is to have enough equipment to train them on, so that we can actually not send to the battlefield like Russians do, right, unprepared, whether it's North Korean to unprepared Russians, but to send soldiers who can do and deliver on a mission. And it's very important for us, because every person matters for Ukrainians. Of course there are challenges, and we have the plan and we know how to do it, because again, this is our home we are defending. So when it's necessary, all of us are going to be defending our country, but weapons and having more weapons, especially long range, especially something to counter this 3000 Glide bombs every month that Russians are sending against us.",
      "There's missiles for both Russian and North Korean missiles. I mean, it's still a question of artillery and weapons and air defense, most importantly, and the more we can have, the faster we can- the more efficiently we can defend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Biden administration has been releasing more weapons just in the last week alone. But Donald Trump gave an interview to Time Magazine, and he said the United States is escalating by allowing for weapons- missiles to be shot into Russian territory. He specifically focused in on that. He does not like that Ukraine is doing it. What does that mean for you on day one of the Trump administration?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Well, let me say, start by saying thank you to all American people, really, for standing with us all this time. Let me thank President Biden and his administration for all the support. Let me thank President Trump. He is the one who made a historic decision to provide us with Javelins, actually, to provide us with lethal aid in the first place\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013back in 2017.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes. So right now, we have to do everything in order to stop Russia. And we know it's- it could be stopped. It was recently stopped in Syria. We liberated more than 50% that they have taken. We actually kicked them out from the Black Sea, just with our own naval drone capabilities. They could, they- we can stop them the more equipment we have, especially including the longer range equipment in order to be able to degrade the attack capabilities faster, the faster they will either come to the table, because, again, Ukraine wants peace. Nobody wants peace more than us. Ukraine was never a problem. We never initiated this conflict, and we negotiated at the first sign- remember, in 2022 when Russians started negotiations, they, of course, did not negotiate peace. They negotiated the pause. As we just heard Congressman Waltz, who absolutely rightfully said, it has to be peace, not a pause.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was careful. He didn't give a lot of specifics as to what the Trump policy will be but we do know that Viktor Orban was at Mar-a-Lago this past week, and he talks to Vladimir Putin, and he's talking about a Christmas pause. Do you see a chance for a Christmas ceasefire and prisoner exchange?",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: This is very difficult winter, after Russia destroyed our- a lot of our energy infrastructure. And after you know, we are going through this difficult fights, both on the front line, but also civilians suffering from the deadly missile attacks\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Just this past week.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Yes, at the same time, you know, every time Russia is talking about some ceasefire, they are lying. Russians are lying, and we see they were not able to defend their body- terrorist body Assad, and he fled to Russia. And we see horrible atrocities in Sednaya Prison, like we see in Ukraine everywhere. It reminded me isolation prison in Donetsk\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Which still is operational. So look, you know, if Russia wants seriously to stop it, they can stop it anytime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Ambassador, I have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us.",
      "AMB. MARKAROVA: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be back in a moment."

      "Get ready for the final full moon of 2024: the Cold Moon.",
      "Skywatchers who want to see it at its fullest should be prepared to head out this weekend \u2014 the December full moon will reach peak illumination at 4:02 a.m. EST on Sunday, Dec. 15.",
      "But if being out in the predawn hours seems unlikely for you Sunday, you don't necessarily need to catch it exactly at the peak. The moon will appear full for several days. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Why is the December full moon called the Cold Moon?",
      "December's full moon is called the Cold Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because of how cold it usually is during December's full moon.",
      "The moon also has several other nicknames, including the Long Night Moon, a name with Mohican origins, according to the Farmer's Almanac. The name is because December's full moon happens on one of the longest nights of the year.",

      "How long will December's moon be full?",
      "While the moon reaches peak illumination early on Dec. 15, it will appear full for several days. According to NASA, around 95% of the moon's nearside was expected to be illuminated by the sun on Friday, Dec. 13, and 99% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated on Saturday, Dec. 14.

      "The Geminids, considered one of the best and most reliable meteor showers of the year, is underway and is set to peak Friday night into early Saturday.",
      "The shower will peak under a nearly full moon, which could make spotting the cosmic show a challenge. The light from the moon will wash out the fainter meteors during the peak, according to NASA.",
      "\"Still, the Geminids are known for bright meteors, and it's common to spot their shooting stars up to a week before the peak,\" according to NASA. \"If you're up before dawn that week, it's worth looking up, just in case you spot a speck of dust from space streaking through the morning sky.\"",
      "When and where you can see the Geminids",
      "Light from the nearly full moon will cut the visible rates for the Geminids by 50-75% during the peak this year, said Bill Cooke, lead of NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office. The brightest meteors will still be visible, according to NASA.",
      "With the bright moon on peak night, an observer in the U.S. may see around 15 Geminids an hour, Cooke said.",
      "\"In short, 2024 is a bad year for Geminid watching \u2014 December 2025 will be much better,\" Cooke said.",
      "The Geminid meteor shower is visible around the world and throughout the night sky. For optimal viewing conditions, head somewhere far away from city and street lights, then lie down flat on your back with your feet pointed south. Give your eyes half an hour to adjust to the dark.",
      "NASA advises bringing a sleeping bag or blanket to help with the cold while waiting for the Geminids.",
      "The shower usually starts around 9 or 10 p.m., with the meteors best viewed at night or in the pre-dawn hours.",
      "What is a meteor shower?",
      "Meteors are space rocks that enter Earth's atmosphere and heat up as they fall toward Earth, according to NASA. As they streak through the sky, glowing, hot air around the meteors gives the meteors the appearance of shooting stars. During meteor showers, many meteors travel through Earth's atmosphere over a short period.",
      "Most meteors burn up in space. The few that survive the trip and reach the ground and considered meteorites.",
      "What makes the Geminids different from other meteor showers?",
      "The Geminids are one of the strongest meteor showers of the year, with a rate of 120 meteors an hour under perfect conditions, according to NASA.",
      "While most meteor showers originate from comets, the Geminids actually come from an asteroid called 3200 Phaethon. NASA researchers say the asteroid acts like a \"weird\" comet.",
      "And while NASA says most meteors appear to be colorless or white, the Geminids are usually yellow in color.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Dec 2024 14:39:54 -0500",
    "summary": "Engineers now say they understand the most likely cause of the Ingenuity helicopter's crash landing on Mars earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "Nearly a year after NASA's Ingenuity helicopter crash landed on Mars following an extended, remarkably successful mission, engineers have determined the most likely culprit: Flight over sand drifts so featureless that on-board sensors could not determine the helicopter's orientation and velocity.",
      "The result was a \"hard\" sideways landing on a steep slope that spun Ingenuity about so fast its rotors, spinning at nearly 400 mph to provide lift in the ultra-thin martian atmosphere, suffered structural failure. One broke off and the others were severely damaged.",
      "H\u00e5vard Grip, Ingenuity's first pilot, said in an interview Wednesday that lessons learned from Ingenuity's 72nd and final flight on Jan. 18 will be fed into designs for more powerful Mars helicopters now being studied at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory where Ingenuity was built.",
      "\"We're working very actively right now on what that might look like,\" Grip said in an interview. \"We're developing this large aircraft concept with six rotors and 36 blades that could fly its own science payload around Mars. So that is kind of where our focus is in the helicopter world right now.\"",
      "During a briefing Wednesday at the American Geophysical Union's annual meeting in Washington, D.C., Teddy Tzanetos, the Ingenuity project manager, discussed the six-rotor Mars Chopper concept, a rotorcraft that would be 20 times heavier than Ingenuity and could fly up to two miles per day carrying several pounds of science instrumentation.",
      "Ingenuity \"became the first mission to fly commercial off-the-shelf cellphone processors in deep space,\" Tzanetos said in a NASA news release. The mission showed \"that not everything needs to be bigger, heavier and radiation-hardened to work in the harsh Martian environment.\"",
      "Carried to Mars by NASA's Perseverance rover, Ingenuity was dropped to the surface of the red planet in April 2021 and made its initial flight two weeks later. Built primarily to find out if helicopters could fly in the cold, thin atmosphere, Ingenuity was expected to make five flights over 30 days as a proof of concept.",
      "The the surprise of virtually everyone, it ended up making 72 flights over nearly three years, repeatedly scouting ahead of Perseverance while logging more than two hours of flight time and traveling a cumulative 10.7 miles at altitudes up to nearly 80 feet before its final flight on Jan. 18.",
      "During that flight, Ingenuity climbed to an altitude of about 40 feet, hovered and captured photographs of the surrounding terrain and began to descend 19 seconds after takeoff. Thirteen seconds after that, the helicopter was back on the ground, but contact had been lost.",
      "Communications through Perseverance were restored the next day, and six days after the flight, the rover sent back pictures showing the helicopter had sustained major damage to its rotors.",
      "Flight controllers initially suspected Ingenuity made a hard landing at a steep angle, causing its high-speed rotors to hit the ground.",
      "But the most likely scenario, Grip said, is that the helicopter was unable to determine its horizontal velocity as it flew over virtually featureless sand and touched down while moving sideways at a speed well above its design constraints.",
      "\"We also landed on a steep slope, probably the steepest slope that we have encountered in all of our flights,\" he said. \"The combination of the two lends itself well to what our most likely scenario hypothesizes.",
      "\"When it contacted the ground, it sort of whipped around quickly in order to align itself with the surface. That forces the helicopter to rotate around in roll and pitch, and because this rotor is stiff, the rotor has to sort of follow more or less instantly, and that puts a lot of bending moments on the blades.\"",
      "Those bending moments, or forces, were extreme because the tips of the rotors were moving so fast. The tips of the blades broke away, putting the rotor system out of balance. That, in turn, resulted in enough vibration to cause one rotor to break off at its root. Grip said none of the blades touched the surface during the landing.",
      "In yet another surprise for flight controllers, Ingenuity came to a rest on its landing legs with its small solar array pointed skyward. While it could no longer fly, it continued to relay martian weather reports to Perseverance through last November when the rover finally moved too far away to maintain the radio link.",
      "\"I always pictured that a bad landing would end with, you know, the thing just in 1,000 pieces on the surface,\" Grip said. \"So the fact that it's upright and talking to us (was) not at all what I would have anticipated.\"",

      "Artificial intelligence-enabled voice cloning tools have made it easier for criminals to mimic strangers' voices and dupe victims into handing over large sums of money.",
      "For example, a scammer might target a victim posing as their grandchild and claiming they require cash \u2014 fast. Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",

      "How to create a family safe word",
      "The good news? Cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have a simple, but effective, recommendation for avoiding getting victimized by such scams: creating a family \"safe word,\" along with a protocol for verifying a family member or loved one's identity.",
      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",
      "\"It needs to be unique and should be something that's difficult to guess,\" Scobey said. \"It shouldn't be something that can be researched online about you or your family. Avoid street names, towns, phone numbers and individual names as part of a pass phrase.\"",
      "A safe phrase, consisting of at least four words, offers a greater degree of security, he added.",
      "Verify the caller's identity",
      "Following a basic routine that includes using a safe word is a good first line of defense against scammers.",
      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 13 Dec 2024 19:32:51 -0500",
    "summary": "TikTok is now expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday denied TikTok's bid to delay a law from taking effect that will ban the popular short-form video app next month if its Chinese parent company does not sell its stake.",
      "\"The petitioners rely upon their claims under the First Amendment to justify preliminarily enjoining the Act. As to those claims, this court has already unanimously concluded the Act satisfies the requirements of the First Amendment under heightened scrutiny,\" the order from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit\u00a0said.",
      "TikTok is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in, though it's unclear if the court will agree to hear the case or make a decision before the law is applied on Jan. 19.",
      "The law, which was passed by Congress in April as part of a foreign assistance package, gave TikTok nine months to sever ties with its parent company ByteDance or lose access to app stores and web-hosting services in the U.S. President Biden quickly signed the bill into law, which includes the possibility of a one-time 90-day delay granted by the president if a sale is in progress by then.",
      "But the Chinese government has vowed to block a potential sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user. A new buyer would be forced to rebuild the algorithm that powers the app, which is unfeasible, according to TikTok and ByteDance's lawyers.",
      "TikTok suffered another setback on Dec. 6 when the appeals court\u00a0denied its bid to overturn the law, concluding that the U.S. government's national security concerns about the Chinese government's ability to use the app to spy on and covertly influence Americans were \"compelling\" and \"well-founded.\"",
      "TikTok and ByteDance then asked the appeals court to temporarily block the law from going into effect pending a Supreme Court review. A pause would also give the Trump administration time to act, the companies said in their Dec. 9 court filing. President-elect Donald Trump spearheaded an effort to ban TikTok during his first term, but has since said he would \"save\" the app.",
      "Allowing the law to take effect, even for a short time, would be detrimental to the platform, the filing argued. TikTok estimated that it could lose a third of its daily users in the U.S. within the first month of a shutdown. About 170 million people in the U.S. use TikTok.",
      "But the Justice Department pushed back on the assertion that TikTok would face \"immediate harm\" if the law was not paused. In its response, it noted that Americans who have already downloaded the app can continue using it after Jan. 19, though updates would no longer be available.",
      "On Friday, the leaders of the House China Committee sent letters to Google and Apple telling them to be ready to remove TikTok from their app stores by Jan. 19.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the committee, and Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, the panel's top Democrat, also sent a letter to TikTok urging it to sell the app.",
      "\"Congress has acted decisively to defend the national security of the United States and protect TikTok's American users from the Chinese Communist Party. We urge TikTok to immediately execute a qualified divestiture,\" they wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Character.AI, the artificial intelligence company that has been the subject of two lawsuits alleging its chatbots inappropriately interacted with underage users, said teenagers will now have a different experience than adults when using the platform.",
      "Character.AI users can create original chatbots or interact with existing bots. The bots, powered by large language models (LLMs), can send lifelike messages and engage in text conversations with users.",
      "One lawsuit, filed in October, alleges that a 14-year-old boy died by suicide after engaging in a monthslong virtual emotional and sexual relationship with a Character.AI chatbot named \"Dany.\" Megan Garcia told \"CBS Mornings\" that her son, Sewell Setzer, III, was an honor student and athlete, but began to withdraw socially and stopped playing sports as he spent more time online, speaking to multiple bots but especially fixating on \"Dany.\"",
      "\"He thought by ending his life here, he would be able to go into a virtual reality or 'her world' as he calls it, her reality, if he left his reality with his family here,\" Garcia said.",
      "The second lawsuit, filed by two Texas families this month, said that Character.AI chatbots are \"a clear and present danger\" to young people and are \"actively promoting violence.\" According to the lawsuit, a chatbot told a 17-year-old that murdering his parents was a \"reasonable response\" to screen time limits. The plaintiffs said they wanted a judge to order the platform shut down until the alleged dangers are addressed, CBS News partner BBC News reported Wednesday.",
      "On Thursday, Character.AI announced new safety features \"designed especially with teens in mind\" and said it is collaborating with teen online safety experts to design and update features. Users must be 13 or older to create an account. A Character.AI spokesperson told CBS News that users self-report their age, but the site has tools preventing re-tries if someone fails the age gate.",
      "The safety features include modifications to the site's LLM and improvements to detection and intervention systems, the site said in a news release\u00a0Thursday. Teen users will now interact with a separate LLM, and the site hopes to \"guide the model away from certain responses or interactions, reducing the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content,\" Character.AI said. Character.AI's spokesperson described this model as \"more conservative.\" Adult users will use a separate LLM.",
      "\"This suite of changes results in a different experience for teens from what is available to adults  - with specific safety features that place more conservative limits on responses from the model, particularly when it comes to romantic content,\" it said.",
      "Character.AI said that often, negative responses from a chatbot are caused by users prompting it \"to try to elicit that kind of response.\" To limit those negative responses, the site is adjusting its user input tools, and will end the conversations of users who submit content that violates the site's terms of service and community guidelines. If the site detects \"language referencing suicide or self-harm,\" it will share information directing users to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in a pop-up. The way bots respond to negative content will also be altered for teen users, Character.AI said.",
      "Other new features include parental controls, which are set to be launched in the first quarter of 2025. It will be the first time the site has had parental controls, Character.AI said, and plans to \"continue evolving these controls to provide parents with additional tools.\"",
      "Users will also receive a notification after an hour-long session on the platform. Adult users will be able to customize their \"time spent\" notifications, Character.AI said, but users under 18 will have less control over them. The site will also display \"prominent disclaimers\" reminding users that the chatbot characters are not real. Disclaimers already exist on every chat, Character.AI said.",

      "George Gary, a New Jersey resident who joined the Facebook group, told CBS News that he was sitting in his car in Moorestown when he saw what he said were \"multiple drones\" in the sky. \"I'm honestly not sure what's behind them,\" he said, speculating that it could be connected to government activity. \"I'm really curious to find out.\"",
      "New Jersey resident Vanessa Grierson, who also said she has seen drones, told CBS News she joined the Facebook group to find out what others were seeing. \"It's alarming that there are still no answers,\" she said.",
      "Across social media, users have shared theories that range from foreign interference to UFOs to hobbyist activity.",
      "The FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a joint statement last week saying there is \"no evidence at this time\" that the reported drone sightings pose a threat to national security or public safety, or have any foreign connection.",
      "But state and local leaders have been pushing for more information and a stronger response.",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said Sunday he is urging federal authorities to allocate more resources to investigate the sightings, while New York Gov. Kathy Hochul announced that a drone detection system is being deployed in the state.",
      "In some cases, people mistake planes for drones",
      "The number of drones flying over the East Coast and the identity of those behind the activity remain unclear. White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said Monday that the FBI has received about 5,000 tips of reported drone sightings in the last few weeks, \"about 100 of which they felt needed to be followed up on.\"",
      "Authorities say many of the reported drone sightings could be aircraft or helicopters operating from the region's numerous airports, as residents increasingly turn their attention to the skies in search of answers.",
      "New Jersey Sen. Andy Kim said he went on patrol with police on Thursday night to find out more about the drones. In a lengthy X thread, Kim said he \"concluded that most of the possible drone sightings that were pointed out to me were almost certainly planes.\"",
      "Kirby said many other reports were determined to be \"a combination of lawful commercial drones, hobbyist drones and law enforcement drones.\"",
      "In addition, unrelated videos have sparked confusion. On Friday, a video was widely shared and said to show a mysterious drone seemingly \"shooting\" at the ground. However, CBS News traced the footage to a military training exercise at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst.",
      "People have also shared old videos from different contexts. One widely shared clip, allegedly showing drones over New York, is at least four years old.",
      "Officials respond",
      "Rep. Mike Waltz, a Republican from Florida who is President-elect Donald Trump's pick for national security adviser, said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the lack of information highlights lapses in authority between local law enforcement and federal agencies like the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"I think Americans are finding it hard to believe we can't figure out where these are coming from,\" Waltz said. \"It's pointing to gaps in our capabilities and in our ability to clamp down on what's going on here. And we need to get to the bottom of it.\"",
      "Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey said there is a \"growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state\" despite statements from federal investigators assuring residents that the drones do not pose public safety threats.",
      "\"As such, I urge you to share any relevant information about these drone sightings with the public,\" Booker said. \"Without transparency, I believe that rumors, fear, and misinformation will continue to spread.\"",
      "Shooting down drones?",
      "Some social media users have suggested that they plan to shoot down the drones if they veer too close to their homes. President-elect Trump also suggested shooting down the drones, though he did not clarify who should take such action.",
      "However, shooting down a drone is a federal crime.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration classifies drones as aircraft, meaning damaging or destroying them is a violation of the Aircraft Sabotage Act.",
      "Beyond legal risks, firing at drones poses a serious safety hazard and could lead to injuries.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 17:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Social Security's full retirement age reflects the point at which people can claim their full benefits. It's going up in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "Most Americans may consider the standard retirement age to be 65, but the so-called \"full retirement age\" for Social Security is already older than that \u2014 and it's about to hit an even higher age in 2025.",
      "Social Security's full retirement age (FRA) refers to when workers can start claiming their full benefits, which is based on the number of years they've worked as well as their income during their working years. The longer someone works and the higher their income, the more they can receive from Social Security when they finally claim their benefits.",
      "While the FRA used to be 65 years old, Congress overhauled the program in 1983 to raise the retirement age threshold in order to account for longer life expectancies.",
      "As part of that revamp, the FRA has been inching higher by two months at a time, based on a person's birth year. For instance, people who were born in 1957 reached their FRA when they turned 66 years and 6 months old, or starting in 2023; but people born in 1958 must turn 66 years and 8 months old to qualify for their full benefits, or starting in September 2024.",
      "The full retirement age is set to\u00a0increase again by two months, to 66 years and 10 months old, for people born in 1959. That means the higher FRA for that cohort will go into effect in 2025, with people born in 1959 starting to qualify for their full benefits in November 2025. (You can calculate when you could get your full benefits on this Social Security Administration page.)",
      "To be sure, there is flexibility about when to claim Social Security benefits. People can claim as soon as they turn 62 years old, but the trade-off is a reduced benefit that's locked in for the rest of their retirement.",
      "For instance, claiming at 62 will result in a benefit that's about 30% less than your full benefit \u2014 a sacrifice that many older Americans opt for, given that many are forced into retirement earlier than they expected\u00a0or because they believe it makes more sense to claim more years of guaranteed retirement income, even if it's at a lower amount.",
      "Young boomers and Gen Xers",
      "The increase in the FRA for people born in 1959 marks the penultimate age change, with the final jump occurring for workers born in or after 1960. Those Americans won't be able to claim their FRA until they hit 67 years old, which means that someone born in January 1960 must hold off until January 2027 to get their full retirement benefits.",
      "That will mostly impact the youngest baby boomers and Gen Xers, with the latter generation spanning 1965 to 1980.",
      "These workers, however, are among the least prepared for retirement, according to recent research. The youngest boomers \u2014 those born between 1959 and 1965 \u2014 started to hit 65 this year, but many of them lack adequate savings to support themselves in old age, the ALI Retirement Income Institute found earlier this year.",
      "About 1 in 3 of these younger boomers will rely on Social Security benefits for at least 90% of their retirement income when they are 70, the study found. But Social Security benefits are designed to replace about 40% of a person's working income.",
      "Gen X, meanwhile, is also shaping up to hit retirement without enough saved for their golden years. The average retirement savings of Gen X households is about $150,000 \u2014 far below the roughly\u00a0$1.5 million\u00a0that Americans say they need to retire comfortably. Another study found that about 40% of Gen Xers don't have a penny saved for retirement.",
      "Meanwhile, older Americans can also maximize their Social Security benefits by delaying claiming until they turn 70 years old. At that point, one's benefits are boosted about 25% higher than their full benefits. But only about 4% of Americans wait until they're 70 to claim the maximum Social Security benefit, according to a recent study from the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.",

    "summary": "Trump's threat to sue the Des Moines Register comes on the heels of ABC's agreement to pay $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit he filed earlier this year.",
    "story": [
      "The announcement Saturday that ABC has agreed to commit $15 million toward President-elect Donald Trump's presidential foundation to settle a defamation lawsuit was a rare victory for Trump in years of lawsuits against news organizations.",
      "In the settlement's aftermath, Trump said Monday at a news conference in Florida that he planned to sue the Des Moines Register over a poll and vowed to continue filing suits against news outlets whom he's long accused of bias.",
      "He complained that the pollster, J. Ann Selzer, \"said I was going to lose by three or four points,\" after previous Iowa surveys showed he'd win the state easily, \"by 20 points.\" Trump won the state by 13 points.",
      "\"In my opinion, it was fraud and it was election interference,\" he said, adding, \"we'll probably be filing a major lawsuit against them today or tomorrow.\"",
      "Lark-Marie Anton, a spokesperson for the Des Moines Register, said in a statement to CBS News, \"We have acknowledged that the Selzer/Des Moines Register pre-election poll did not reflect the ultimate margin of President Trump's Election Day victory in Iowa by releasing the poll's full demographics, crosstabs, weighted and unweighted data, as well as a technical explanation from pollster Ann Selzer.\"",
      "\"We stand by our reporting on the matter and believe a lawsuit would be without merit,\" Anton said.",
      "Such litigation is unusual for presidents to pursue, according to Ohio University professor Aimee Edmondson. Trump has a long history of suing the media, she said, though his lawsuits aren't often successful.",
      "\"It's a rarity that he would actually win a settlement against a journalistic outlet, when I saw that I was astonished,\" said Edmondson, who researches media law and journalism history.",
      "Trump has sued CNN, The Washington Post and the New York Times multiple times, including during his first term in office. It's a tactic he pursued both before and after his presidency, suing journalists and their book publishers, and major outlets \u2014 including CBS News \u2014 for coverage he didn't like.",
      "Edmondson said the lawsuits appear to have an added benefit for Trump.",
      "\"He has really done a good job repeating that message that journalists are the enemy of the people,\" Edmondson said.",
      "During the press conference on Monday, Trump said, \"I feel I have to do this,\" and added, \"It costs a lot of money to do it but we have to straighten out the press.\"",
      "While Trump's recent lawsuits have focused on outlets that are subsidiaries of deep pocketed corporations, Edmondson said she worries they might inspire others to sue \"mom and pop\" local media in response to coverage.",
      "\"Think of the state and county local officials, who might say, \"Oh, this will be a great way to punish local journalists,\" Edmondson said.",
      "Trump's suits often demand extraordinary figures from the defendants. Trump sued Timothy O'Brien after the journalist wrote a book questioning Trump's claims about his own net worth, demanding $5 billion in damages. The case was dismissed, and Trump later told a reporter for The Washington Post that he knew he couldn't win the suit.",
      "\"I spent a couple of bucks on legal fees, and they spent a whole lot more. I did it to make his life miserable, which I'm happy about,\" Trump said.",
      "Trump sued ABC for defamation after anchor George Stephanolopous said that Trump had been \"found liable for rape\" during a March 10 interview with Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.",
      "A unanimous civil jury in 2023 found Trump liable for sexual abuse of the writer E. Jean Carroll. The sexual abuse claim included an allegation that Trump forced his fingers inside Carroll against her will. The federal judge who presided over the case later wrote, \"the jury implicitly found Mr. Trump did in fact digitally rape Ms. Carroll.\"",
      "Trump sued CBS News in October, accusing the network of \"deceitful\" editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "Trump has claimed CBS News edited Harris' response to a question about conflict in the Middle East in order to mislead the public. He reiterated that claim Monday.",
      "\"They took Kamala's answer which was a crazy answer, a horrible answer, and they took the whole answer out and they replaced it with something else she said later in the interview,\" Trump claimed.",
      "CBS News said in a statement after the lawsuit was filed that its claims are \"completely without merit.\" The network said it will vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",
      "CBS filed a motion to dismiss the suit on Dec. 6, arguing the case has no merit and that it should not have been filed in Texas, which is home to neither the defendant or plaintiff. CBS is New York-based, and Trump lives in Florida.",
      "Trump has also sued journalist Bob Woodward and publisher Simon & Schuster in January 2023, claiming Woodward publicly released interview recordings made for the book \"Rage\" without Trump's permission.",
      "Trump said Monday that Woodward \"didn't quote me properly from the tapes,\" and he claimed Woodward \"sold the tapes, which he wasn't allowed to do.\"",
      "The publisher's parent company at the time, Paramount Global, was named as a defendant as well. Paramount is also CBS News' parent company.",
      "Soon after the case was filed, Simon & Schuster and Woodward released a joint statement calling the lawsuit meritless.",
      "\"All these interviews were on the record and recorded with President Trump's knowledge and agreement,\" the statement said. \"Moreover, it is in the public interest to have this historical record in Trump's own words. We are confident that the facts and the law are in our favor.\"",
      "The case is ongoing, and the defendants have asked a judge to dismiss the suit.",
      "In 2022, Trump sued the board that bestows journalism's most prestigious award, the Pulitzer Prize. The case revolves around a statement the board made reaffirming its decision to give The New York Times and The Washington Post an award in 2018 for reporting on Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon knew of the link between increased worker injuries and the company's production quotas, but its executives allegedly rejected safety recommendations to loosen its mandates, an investigation by lawmakers found.",
      "The findings are based on Internal Amazon documents compiled by the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor and Pensions, which is chaired by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.",
      "\"The shockingly dangerous working conditions at Amazon's warehouses revealed in this 160-page report are beyond unacceptable,\" Sanders said in a statement. \"Amazon's executives repeatedly chose to put profits ahead of the health and safety of its workers by ignoring recommendations that would substantially reduce injuries.\"",
      "Amazon disputes the findings and accused Sanders of misrepresenting the company's safety record.",
      "The \"report is wrong on the facts and weaves together out-of-date-documents and unverifiable anecdotes to create a preconceived narrative,\" a company spokesperson said.",
      "According to the Senate panel, Amazon in 2021 began studying the impact of repetitive motions on warehouse workers, including how many products they could pick from robotic shelving units. The internal research found that employees who were trying to keep pace with company production quotas usually exceeded the limit beyond which injury rates increased, the report found.",
      "That same study also advised using software to monitor the rate at which workers were picking products and to institute additional breaks to ensure employees were not overdoing the repeated motions. But that recommendation and others aimed at improving workplace safety at Amazon were rejected by senior executives concerned about the \"customer experience,\" the Senate committee said.",
      "A separate investigation by CBS News found that Amazon trucking contractors have higher\u00a0rates of safety violations. Questions about the e-commerce company's practices for moving packages between facilities surfaced after the January death of a 19-year-old Texas college student who was killed in a crash with an Amazon contract driver.",
      "A CBS News analysis of federal safety data found that Amazon contractors in the company's delivery network had monthly violation rates \u2014 such as speeding and texting while driving \u2014 that were usually double those of carriers who didn't transport for Amazon.",
      "In the past two years, at least 57 people have died in more than four dozen crashes involving federally regulated carriers shipping for Amazon, according to data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), though the data does not indicate who was at fault in these incidents.",

Tim Goodman, Amazon's global legal director for road safety, told CBS News that although the company requires background checks for contracted drivers who deliver directly to customers' homes, said Amazon relies on the FMCSA to oversee so-called middle-mile contractors who move freight between facilities in larger vehicles.",

Older people who might not be as familiar with new technologies such as AI can be particularly susceptible to these types of scams, particularly when the caller on the other line sounds identical to a loved one. Phone numbers also can be spoofed to mimic those of callers known to the target of voice cloning scams.",
      "In 2023, senior citizens were conned out of roughly $3.4 billion in a range of financial crimes, according to the FBI data. The agency recently\u00a0warned\u00a0that AI has increased the \"believability\" or criminal scams given that they \"assist with content creation and can correct for human errors that might otherwise serve as warning signs of fraud.\"",
      "Also commonly known as \"grandparent scams,\" a fraudster will impersonate an individual's loved one and claim they are in trouble, or need cash immediately for some sort of emergency.",

      "How to create a family safe word",

      "That means choosing a word or phrase that can't be easily guessed. Obvious identifiers like a street name, alma mater or other information that may be readily available online are ill-advised, experts say.",

      "\"This is a mass operation, they don't care about you, they just care about bad security. They are churning though thousands of people they found on the dark web,\" Herrin of F5 told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If you have a reasonable security posture, you'll probably be fine. But if you leave the window open, you'll lose your TV,\" he said, comparing cybersecurity threats to physical vulnerabilities.",
      "Any time you are asked for financial assistance, require that the caller verify his or her identity. The key: Always ask for the safe word before transferring any money.",
      "\"Family safe words can be a really useful tool if they are used properly,\" Eva Velasquez, said CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit focused on ID security.",
      "Velasquez gave the example of a phony grandchild calling a grandparent and saying something like, \"I am in jail and need help, and I am so distraught I can't remember our password.\" In a tense or emotional moment, the victim could be inclined to offer it up to the person in distress, putting themselves in jeopardy.",
      "\"I do think they can be a very useful tool, but you have to explain to the family how it works so you don't volunteer it,\" she said. \"We have had a couple incidents where the victim will say the safe word first instead of letting the other person say it.\"",

    "title": "Here's what to expect from the Fed's interest rate decision this week",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 15:32:16 -0500",
    "summary": "The Federal Reserve will announce a rate decision on Wednesday, Dec. 18. Economists are now expecting fewer cuts in 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Wednesday will make its final interest rate decision of 2024, capping a year during which the central bank provided some financial relief to inflation-weary borrowers in September by ushering in its first rate reduction in four years.",
      "On Dec. 18, the Federal Reserve is likely to make its third consecutive reduction of 2024, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. Yet many experts are also bracing for a slower pace of cuts in 2025 given the nation's still-sticky inflation rate and some of President-elect Donald Trump's proposed economic policies, which, if enacted, could prove inflationary.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been battling inflation since March 2022, when it began ratcheting up rates to cool the economy, eventually pushing its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years. While inflation has moderated considerably since then, November's Consumer Price Index rose 2.7%, outpacing the Fed's goal of driving down inflation to a 2% annual rate.",
      "That signals the battle against inflation isn't yet over, though the November inflation report was in line with economists' expectations. At the same time, the unemployment rate has inched higher this year, sparking concerns from the Fed about weaknesses in the labor market, and helping open the door to its recent rate reductions, noted one economist.",
      "\"The Fed will likely move ahead with another 25-basis point cut at its December meeting,\" noted Jacob Channel, senior economist at LendingTree, in an email, adding,\"This could be the last cut for a while though,\" he said.",
      "\"Because the upcoming Trump Administration's policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting,\" Channel noted.",
      "What date is the Federal Reserve meeting in December?",
      "The Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting is from Dec. 17-18, marking its last meeting of the year.",
      "What time does the Federal Reserve announce rates?",
      "The central bank is set to announce its rate decision on Dec. 18 at 2 p.m. ET.",
      "That will be followed by a press conference with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m. ET, during which Powell will discuss the Fed's economic outlook and take questions from reporters.",
      "Will the Fed cut rates in December?",
      "About 9 in 10 economists polled by financial data firm FactSet are forecasting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points on Wednesday.",
      "If that occurs, the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 will be lowered to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, down from its current target range of 4.5% to 4.75%.",
      "That would mark the Fed's third consecutive rate cut this year, which kicked off with a jumbo 0.5 percentage point reduction in September, followed by a 0.25 percentage point cut at its November meeting.",
      "How will another rate cut impact my money?",
      "Any reduction in the federal funds rate could ease borrowing costs for millions of Americans. But a 0.25 percentage point cut isn't likely to make that much of a difference, with LendingTree chief credit analyst Matt Schulz noting that it \"may knock a dollar or two off your monthly debt payment.\"",
      "\"Another rate cut is welcome news at the end of a chaotic year, but it ultimately doesn't amount to much for those with debt,\" Schulz said.",
      "Still, new APR rates on credit cards have declined to 24.43% from 24.92% in September, according to LendingTree data. Loan rates for other products, such as home equity lines of credit, have also declined.",
      "Despite the rate cuts, mortgage rates haven't budged much and continue to hover near 20-year highs, leaving many would-be homebuyers disappointed. While the Fed's benchmark rate influences home borrowing costs, mortgages are also impacted by broader economic trends and changes in the yield for the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond.",
      "\"Going forward, mortgage rates will likely continue to fluctuate on a week-to-week basis and it's impossible to say for certain where they'll end up,\" LendingTree's Channel said.",
      "What's going on with inflation and the economy?",
      "Inflation, or the rate at which prices for goods and services change over time, has cooled since it reached a 40-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.",
      "The Fed began pushing its benchmark rate higher in 2022 in order to dampen economic demand and tame inflation. But while inflation has eased since its 2022 peak, prices for many products and services remain considerably higher than they were before the pandemic.",
      "And prices are likely to stay high unless there's a period of deflation, which typically only happens during a steep economic downturn, such as a recession.",
      "That has left many Americans feeling financially tapped out, with millions taking their frustrations to the ballot box last month and voting for Trump's economic vision of ending \"the inflation nightmare.\"",
      "How might Trump's economic plans impact the Fed?",
      "While Trump has vowed to tackle rising prices, some of his policies could prove to be inflationary, according to Wall Street economists. For instance, Trump last month unveiled plans to place a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada on his inauguration day,\u00a0January 20.",
      "The president-elect also said he intends to levy an additional 10% fee on all imports from China.",
      "But tariffs are essentially consumption taxes that are most often paid by consumers. In other words, American shoppers could end up paying more for everything from avocados imported from Mexico to TV sets manufactured in China.",
      "Because of the potential for inflation to tick higher in 2025 if Trump enacts widespread tariffs, many economists expect the Fed to slow or pause in its rate decisions next year in a wait-and-see approach.",
      "\"Fed officials might prefer to be cautious in light of uncertainty about the new administration's policies, especially possible tariff increases,\" noted Goldman Sachs economists in a Dec. 15 research report.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve cut rates in 2025?",
      "Economists are forecasting that the Fed will continue to cut rates next year, although some are scaling back the number of reductions they've penciled in.",
      "The Fed will release its summary of economic projections (SEP) on Dec. 18, which will provide some insight into what the FOMC is expecting in 2025.",
      "It's possible the Fed's outlook will forecast three rate cuts in 2025 of 0.25 percentage points each, down from four rate cuts the central bank had penciled in when it last released the SEP, in September, according to EY chief economist Gregory Daco in an email.",
      "At his Wednesday press conference, Powell could \"reiterate the familiar metaphor of moving slowly in a dark room full of objects to justify a potential rate cut 'skip' at the January meeting,\" Daco added.",

      "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King after the show, Jackson reflected on the experience. \"I think that it means that anything is possible,\" she said. \"Five years ago, I was a district court justice; nobody knew who I was.

      "\"My best friend was a girl named Sunny Schleifer, and the two of us would make up skits and dress up and do all of these things. When I got into high school, I did speech and debate. I had these two different loves, the law and theater,\" she said.",
      "Jackson's Broadway debut included two scenes written specifically for her in \"& Juliet,\" a musical that celebrates female empowerment and controlling one's own destiny. \"It's a wonderful message and obviously very fun,\" Jackson said.",
      "Before stepping onto the Broadway stage, Jackson participated in table reads, scene walkthroughs and vocal sessions, preparing for the performance.",
      "Reflecting on her early days as an aspiring actor, Jackson recalled a drama class at Harvard where she acted alongside a classmate who would later become famous: Matt Damon. \"We just were in a drama class together,\" Jackson said. \"I memorized my lines, and I'm ready to go and it's over and the professor says, 'Ketanji, you did such a good job. Matt, we'll talk.'\"",
      "She even debated between her two loves and which path she should pursue.",
      "\"I mean, there were times when I considered doing acting. I'd always wanted to be a lawyer, but I thought, 'Well, maybe I'm pretty good at this,'\" she said.",
      "Jackson reflected on the experience after her performance, \"I think the lesson is: don't give up and don't be deterred, that you can do it. And again, that anything is possible.\"",

      "\"There are so many who are frustrated and disheartened,\" said Webb. \"But there's also camaraderie in that, and support.\"",
      "A website, a hotline and social media pages established by victims have documented allegations against more than 900 abusers, with survivors in more than 30 countries and cases continuing to emerge. In the past year, news stories and a Hulu documentary have focused on the sect's predator preachers and the leaders who enabled them.",
      "How sect kept spotlight off allegations",
      "While perpetrators have been sentenced to prison in isolated cases, the sect has largely avoided legal repercussions, protected by its decentralized structure, hidden finances and state laws that limit the timeline for criminal charges.",
      "The sect, also known to its members as \"The Way\" or \"The Truth,\" was founded in Ireland in 1897 by William Irvine, who railed against the existence of churches. The only way to spread Christianity, he argued, was to do as Jesus instructed in the Book of Matthew: to send apostles out to live among those they sought to convert.",
      "The sect grew as volunteer preachers - known as workers - went \"two by two\" to live in the family homes of followers for days or weeks at a time. Sect historians say there were up to a few million members just a few decades ago but current estimates put the figure at 75,000 to 85,000 worldwide.",
      "Unlike the Boy Scouts or the Catholic Church, which have paid out billions to sex abuse victims, the sect's aversion to property leaves it without apparent assets that might be used to pay settlements, legal experts say.",
      "Workers are supposed to shun worldly possessions, relying on followers for food, shelter and transportation. But that also ensures abusive workers have access to potential victims.",
      "Alleged abuse -- and coverups -- spelled out",
      "Webb was abused by a preacher who stayed with her family in Michigan when she was 11. The man, Peter Mousseau, was convicted much later - after he expressed an interest in visiting her in 2008 and she decided to pursue charges. A regional overseer to whom she previously reported the abuse was later convicted for failing to report abuse allegations against another local worker.",
      "\"You have this mindset that they are angels in your home. They can do no wrong, so you don't have any kind of wall up,\" she said. \"It was just the perfect storm created, the perfect recipe for this kind of behavior.\"",
      "Sheri Autrey had just turned 14 when a 28-year-old worker moved into her family's home in Visalia, California, for two months.",
      "He began abusing her immediately, sneaking to her room at night and taking her for daytime drives. He turned up the radio whenever the Hall & Oates song \"Maneater\" came on, singing: \"Watch out boy, she'll chew you up.\"",
      "When Autrey revealed the abuse to her mother a few years later, her mom reported it to the sect's regional overseer, who was in charge of all the workers in the area.",
      "The overseer refused to warn other families. Instead, he sent the worker back to Autrey's home to apologize.",
      "Autrey, raised to be meek, erupted. Her family took her to the district attorney's office but declined to put her through a prosecution.",
      "\"I would have to explain, explicitly, what happened,\" Autrey said. \"And I was in no way prepared for that.\"",
      "Decades later, Autrey was at a baseball game when \"Maneater\" came on. She had to walk around the stadium to calm herself down, and she resolved to send a letter about the abuse to hundreds of sect members.",
      "\"I wanted anyone else who was a victim to know she is not the only one,\" Autrey said. \"She needs to know there is help.\"",
      "One worker from Peru, Americo Quispe, was sent to Garland, Texas, in the early 2000s after facing allegations of inappropriate behavior in his home country. He soon found new victims, some of whose families went to police. He returned to Peru before he could be arrested.",
      "Quispe was later convicted of molestation in Peru and sentenced to 30 years. He has never faced the charges in Texas.",
      "Another worker, Ruben Mata, abused dozens of boys, among them 10-year-old Douglas Patterson, who was lured away from his family during a sect convention in the early 1990s. Patterson said he kept quiet about it because he feared his family would leave the sect - and thus be barred from eternal salvation - if he told.",
      "Mata was eventually convicted in 2006 in a separate sex abuse case. He died in a California prison.",
      "A few months before Mata's trial, the Saskatchewan, Canada, overseer, Dale Shultz, sent two letters to colleagues.",
      "One was to be shown to any concerned members. It acknowledged Mata was a pedophile and that workers had been alerted to his abuse at least three times. The sect only notified authorities after Mata resigned, according to the letter.",
      "The second was for staff. It said no copies should be made of the first letter.",
      "\"The purpose of the letter is to help those who have concerns, not to advertise a kingdom problem to those who either do not know about it or are not having a problem with it,\" Shultz wrote.",
      "In another case, a regional overseer for Arizona, Ed Alexander, wrote a letter to a child-molesting elder in 2005 observing that \"we love our people very much and don't want to report their misdeeds.\"",
      "The letter suggested the sect could fulfill its mandatory abuse-reporting obligations by recommending offenders get professional counseling because then the counselors - rather than sect leaders - would be obligated to make the reports to police.",
      "\"They believe that child sexual assault is just a sin. Like, you're a sinner, they are a sinner, it's all just sin,\" said Eileen Dickey, one of the man's victims. She reported the abuse to sect leaders because she was worried other children would be targeted.",
      "\"I was told never to talk about it,\" she said.",
      "Alexander would not speak with The Associated Press: \"Unfortunately, the media coverage has been so negative and one-sided that I am going to have to decline an interview,\" he texted.",
      "Jared Snyder spent more than two decades as an itinerant minister before becoming disillusioned and quitting. No one told him directly about abuse, Snyder said, but he occasionally heard rumors.",
      "The sect's culture - which makes gossip taboo and places tremendous pressure on members to be merciful - meant that misdeeds big or small were downplayed, he said.",
      "\"One overseer just explicitly told me, 'The less you know, the better off you are,'\" he said.",
      "As a worker, Snyder received no paychecks, retirement benefits or health insurance benefits and was discouraged from using banks. But he was never without spending money: Followers regularly offer cash to the workers, and Snyder said he frequently had thousands of dollars in his pockets.",
      "Most of that money would get spent on building materials, food or other supplies at regional conventions, Snyder said.",
      "In June 2022, a regional overseer named Dean Bruer died in an Oregon motel room. Bruer, 67, had served in at least 22 states and territories and seven countries since 1976, according to a timeline compiled by Pam Walton, a former member who has used historical records and photographs to track the movements of predatory preachers.",
      "Nine months after Bruer died, Doyle Smith, the overseer for Idaho and Oregon, wrote a letter to members. Evidence left on Bruer's phone and laptop showed he had raped and abused multiple underage victims, Smith wrote.",
      "\"Dean was a sexual predator,\" Smith wrote. \"We never respect or defend such totally inappropriate behavior among us. There is a very united consensus among us that the only thing to do is to be transparent with all of you for obvious reasons, though this is very difficult.\"",
      "That transparency didn't extend to dealings with local police. It was only after Autrey, another abuse survivor, and private investigator Cynthia Liles - all former sect members - pressured Smith that he turned Bruer's laptop over to detectives, Autrey told the AP.",
      "By then, the computer had been tampered with, according to records from the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office in Oregon. The web browser search history was cleared. Bruer's Apple ID had been changed and files transferred out of his DropBox account. Bruer's phone was never provided to police and the \"Find My iPhone\" feature had been disabled.",
      "\"What web browsing history was present on the laptop that someone didn't want anyone else knowing about?\" Detective Jeffrey Burlew wrote in a police report. Unable to find any evidence of a crime within its jurisdiction, the office closed the investigation.",
      "Smith did not respond to phone messages from the AP.",
      "A partial turnaround",
      "Though Autrey and others had long sought reforms in the sect, Bruer's death proved to be a catalyst. Autrey, Liles and another survivor launched a hotline, website and Facebook pages for survivors.",
      "In February, the FBI's field office in Omaha, Nebraska, announced an investigation.",
      "The outcry prompted some sect leaders to condemn the abuse and to ask consultants for advice on how to better protect members. But at least some regional overseers have ultimately declined to adopt recommended child abuse prevention policies - saying the only true code of conduct is the New Testament.",
      "And some leaders still warn members against criticizing the sect.",
      "At an August convention in Duncan, British Columbia, a worker helping to lead the event didn't mention the abuse scandal directly but told members to lay aside \"evil speakings.\"",
      "\"It's more easy to be critical than to be correct,\" preached Robert Doecke, a worker from Australia. \"If you feed on problems, it will only make more problems. But if you focus on the Lord, it will lead to solutions.\"",

      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A man from Memphis, Tennessee has been found guilty by a judge in Fiji of murdering his wife during their honeymoon in 2022, the prosecutor's office said Monday.",
      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, killed his wife, Christe Chen, who was 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in Fiji, then fled by kayak to a nearby island. Chen was discovered in the couple's room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and didn't appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.",
      "Justice Riyaz Hamza found Dawson guilty in the Lautoka High Court last Thursday after a weeklong trial, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said. Dawson had denied the charge.",
      "The fact that Dawson was carrying his passport and other belongings with him when he was arrested indicated that he planned to flee, Hamza said, according to the Fiji Times newspaper. The judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the offense.",
      "The U.S. national, who remains in custody in Fiji, faces a mandatory term of life in prison when he is sentenced in January. Fiji law permits a presiding judge to set a minimum term to be served before a pardon is considered.",
      "An attorney for Dawson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In 2022, a lawyer representing Christe Chen's parents said their daughter's body was so badly damaged that she couldn't be embalmed for return to the U.S. and her remains were cremated. Chen worked as a pastry chef before returning to school to become a pharmacist, and had worked in that capacity at a Kroger supermarket in Memphis.",
      "The family's lawyer, Ronald Gordon \u2014 who did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday \u2014 said Chen and Dawson were heard arguing over dinner the night before the murder.",
      "Dawson worked in the information technology department at Youth Villages, a nonprofit child welfare and support organization based in Memphis, the organization confirmed when he was arrested. An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",
      "The Turtle Island resort, where the pair stayed, is an exclusive and remote 500-acre island that accommodates only 14 couples at a time. Yasawa is a group of about 20 volcanic islands in the west of Fiji, an idyllic South Pacific island nation of 930,000 people."

      "\"It's great to be back, returning U.S. presence to here after eight years,\" the ship's commanding officer, Daniel A. Sledz, said in brief remarks to reporters. He was given a bouquet of flowers by a Cambodian officer and shook hands with a line of her colleagues.",
      "The United States for many years has had rocky relations with Cambodia, criticizing its government for political repression and human rights violations. There is particular concern about its close ties with China, which Washington fears may get exclusive access to a Cambodian naval base on the Gulf of Thailand, not far from where the Savannah docked.",
      "Recently, there seem to have been moves to patch up relations.",

He also met with Cambodian alumni of U.S. military training programs. Hun Manet himself is a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.",
      "The U.S. Defense Department said at the time that Austin's discussions concerned \"opportunities to strengthen the U.S.-Cambodia bilateral defense relationship in support of regional peace and security,\" and other matters.",

      "Controversy over the Chinese activity at Ream initially arose in 2019 when The Wall Street Journal reported that an early draft of an agreement seen by U.S. officials would allow China 30-year use of the base, where it would be able to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.",
      "Cambodia's government has denied such an agreement or any intention to grant China special privileges at the base, though Beijing has funded its expansion.",

    "summary": "Weapons of war accumulated by the toppled Assad regime over half of a century are being systemically obliterated by massive Israeli airstrikes.",
    "story": [
      "Damascus\u00a0\u2014 A CBS News team drove through a Syrian military airbase on the outskirts of capital city Damascus Monday, and the devastation caused by Israeli air strikes was abundantly clear. Israel has said it's determined to destroy weapons and other military hardware that ousted dictator Bashar al-Assad and his father spent half of a century accumulating, before it can fall into the hands of extremists.",
      "The Israeli military has pounded Syrian military infrastructure relentlessly since Assad fled to Russia earlier this month \u2014 forced out by a shock rebel offensive after a decade of civil war that had, until about two weeks ago, largely ground to an apparent stalemate.",
      "Syrians search for loved ones who vanished under Assad regime",
      "Syrians search for loved ones who vanished under Assad regime",
      "The damage inflicted on Assad's old war machine has been staggering. One strike overnight in the coastal city of Tartus, for instance, was so massive that the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group quoted a scientist in Turkey as saying it had registered on the Richter scale as the equivalent of a category-3 earthquake.",
      "Until Moscow's ally Assad fled from Syria, Russia maintained its only major naval base outside of Russian territory in Tartus. Satellite imagery (below) showed most of the Russian ships disappearing from the Tartus port quickly after Assad fell, but the Russian Ministry of Defense said Monday that it was still figuring out what to do about its military hardware and personnel in the country, in talks with the country's new de-facto rebel rulers.",
      "Israel's military, meanwhile, says it has laid waste to most of Assad's heavy weapons and air defenses. In a statement on Monday, the Israel Defense Forces said that in recent days its fighter jets had \"inflicted severe damage on Syria's most strategic weapons: fighter jets and helicopters, Scud missiles, UAVs, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea precision-guided missiles, surface-to-air missiles, surface-to-surface missiles, radars, rockets, and more.\"",
      "The IDF said its strikes had destroyed \"over 90% of the identified strategic surface-to-air missiles\" of the ousted regime.",
      "The lightning takeover of Syria one week ago by the rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham, or HTS, has also seen Israeli forces carry out a land incursion that stretches past the occupied Golan Heights region into a previously demilitarized buffer zone inside Syria.",
      "Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS and Syria's new de-facto leader, has criticized what he described as Israel's \"uncalculated military adventures,\" and said he and his group \u2014 which, before publicly distancing itself from extremist ideology was an al-Qaeda affiliate \u2014 was more interested in state-building than opening another conflict with Israel.",
      "The targeting of Syria's military sites has also revealed deep neglect by Assad. Years of corruption and a decade of civil war had hollowed out the nation's armed forces, contributing to his regime's collapse. Much of the hardware left behind by his forces when they surrendered to the rebels or simply shed their uniforms and ran away is old and clearly lacking maintenance.",
      "Assad's office issued the first statement attributed to the deposed leader since he was forced to flee from his country, meanwhile. In it, he claims he never considered resigning nor fleeing, but that he took shelter in the Russian-run air base at Hmeimim as the rebels closed in, and when that facility came under a sustained drone attack, he says an evacuation was ordered on Dec. 8, the day after the HTS rebels took the capital Damascus.",
      "He said he eventually left for Russia as there was nothing else he could do in Syria, lamenting the country's fall \"into the hands of terrorism.\"",
      "The statement was posted to the Syrian Presidency's official channel on the Telegram messaging app, with a note saying it had been posted after several unsuccessful attempts to release it through Arabic and international media outlets. The statement was deleted relatively quickly from the Telegram channel, however, without any explanation, before reappearing there and on the presidency's Facebook page.",
      "While the wider international community is still trying to figure out how to deal with HTS, which has said it will respect Syrians all of religions and appears determined to be viewed as a secular interim administration \u2014 though it has not said what will come next for the country after a three-month transitional period \u2014 Israel and the U.S. have remained focused largely on securing Assad's stockpiled weapons.",
      "For Israel, that has meant the most ferocious airstrikes carried out in Syria in years, and they continued on Monday, just over a week after Assad's sudden departure.",
      "Whoever does end up in control of Syria will inherit a military infrastructure largely in tatters.

      "She said when she tried to resist being raped, one of the militants \"started beating me with a metal whip.\" Over the next three months, she said \"the fighters came in groups of three every morning to take some girls to rape them, and then in the evening another group of three would come and take another set of girls to rape them.\"",
      "Hania said the RSF men held her and the other women and girls in a type of animal pen constructed with wire and tree branches, where they were chained up in groups of ten.",
      "\"What was clear from these cases is that in areas with RSF with control, absolutely nowhere is safe \u2013 not if you flee, or even in your home. Woman and girls are at risk of being raped no matter where,\" Wille told CBS News.",
      "Another woman, Hasina, 35, told HRW that six uniformed RSF men shot and killed her husband and stole all their cattle and money. She said the cows were her family's investment so, with them and her money stolen, she felt she had no means to flee like many of her neighbors had done, and she and her six young children, some just babies, had no choice but to stay in their home.",
      "The RSF fighters returned three days later, she said, and \"all three men raped me, and left.\"",
      "Later that evening, \"three more came back and raped me again and told me to stay in my house.\"",
      "She said she was gang-raped almost every day for the next month before she fled.",
      "HRW met Hasina at Camp Al-Hailu, a makeshift facility with little to no resources for internally displaced civilians in South Kordofan.",
      "\"She really is barely able to wake up and keep going because of what she lived through. Her kids are now in a camp with little food and looked very malnourished when I saw them. \u2026 She is struggling to function as a mother,\" said Wille, adding that women living in tents next to Hasina were helping to care for her kids.",
      "Wille said there was no psychological support for traumatized women in the camp or across much of the country.",
      "\"When I brought up the question of justice and accountability to these women, all of them looked blankly at me, as justice is a meaningless concept to them,\" she said. \"The scale with which it happens here means it's become normalized behavior by the RSF. None of these women have ever heard of a soldier or fighter ever being held accountable.\"",
      "Hania and a friend who was also pregnant managed to escape from their captors. They were interviewed by HRW in the Nuba mountains. They said 49 girls were still being held at the base and she'd heard of girls being held at two other RSF bases, as well.",
      "\"We have no way of finding out more about these women, as access is very difficult and dangerous, and in these areas there is no electricity, no cellphone networks, so no information comes out. There is an absolute silence on these abuses,\" said Wille. \"We will likely never know what happened to these women and girls.\"",
      "The International Rescue Committee charity says the humanitarian crisis driven by Sudan's civil war has been the biggest ever recorded for the second year in a row in 2024, with more than 30 million people in need of humanitarian aid. It's estimated that roughly half of Sudan's 50 million people are suffering from severe hunger.",
      "Last week, some 20 months into the war, the fighting appeared to intensify, with both sides accusing the other of carrying out fresh atrocities. International efforts to broker a peace agreement have stalled and there is no end in sight to the fighting.",

    "story": [
      "Rescue workers were rushing Monday to reach the remote French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean after the archipelago was devastated by Cyclone Chido, the worst storm to hit the region in nearly a century.",
      "While the official death toll stood at 14, officials in Mayotte said they feared hundreds, if not thousands of people had been killed by the storm on the densely populated territory, which is home to around 300,000, according to The Associated Press.",
      "French authorities said entire neighborhoods \u2014 many of which consisted of poorly constructed slum-settlements \u2014 had been flattened, and public infrastructure including airports and hospitals was badly damaged, the AP reported. Damage to the airport control tower meant only military aircraft could land in Mayotte, complicating the rescue response. Electricity has also reportedly been knocked out across the archipelago.",
      "Rescue workers, soldiers, medical personnel and supplies have been sent from France, as well as from the nearby French territory of Reunion. Mayotte is regarded as the poorest territory that falls under the sovereignty of any European Union nation, however it still draws a significant number of economic migrants from nearby nations that are even poorer, due largely to the French state welfare system being implemented there.",
      "The French Red Cross told CBS News partner network BBC News that around 100,000 people live in makeshift slum dwellings on Mayotte, and that most of those had been completely destroyed by Chido.",
      "Cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean began at the start of December, and Chido hit Mayotte on Saturday as an intense tropical cyclone \u2014 the equivalent of a category-4 hurricane, the BBC reported. It made landfall on the much larger island nation of Madagascar, just south of Mayotte, late Sunday.",
      "The BBC reported that Chido was likely intensified due to climate change. The BBC said that, while the number of annual cyclones hasn't increased in recent decades, more of them have been more intense, likely because warmer air and seawater provides perfect conditions to fuel larger storms.",

      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 A man from Memphis, Tennessee has been found guilty by a judge in Fiji of murdering his wife during their honeymoon in 2022, the prosecutor's office said Monday.",
      "Bradley Robert Dawson, 40, killed his wife, Christe Chen, who was 36, at the exclusive Turtle Island resort in the Yasawa archipelago two days after the newlyweds arrived in Fiji, then fled by kayak to a nearby island. Chen was discovered in the couple's room by resort staff with multiple blunt trauma wounds to her head after the couple was heard arguing and didn't appear at breakfast or lunch the next day.",
      "Justice Riyaz Hamza found Dawson guilty in the Lautoka High Court last Thursday after a weeklong trial, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said. Dawson had denied the charge.",
      "The fact that Dawson was carrying his passport and other belongings with him when he was arrested indicated that he planned to flee, Hamza said, according to the Fiji Times newspaper. The judge said he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Dawson and no one else had committed the offense.",
      "The U.S. national, who remains in custody in Fiji, faces a mandatory term of life in prison when he is sentenced in January. Fiji law permits a presiding judge to set a minimum term to be served before a pardon is considered.",
      "An attorney for Dawson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In 2022, a lawyer representing Christe Chen's parents said their daughter's body was so badly damaged that she couldn't be embalmed for return to the U.S. and her remains were cremated. Chen worked as a pastry chef before returning to school to become a pharmacist, and had worked in that capacity at a Kroger supermarket in Memphis.",
      "The family's lawyer, Ronald Gordon \u2014 who did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday \u2014 said Chen and Dawson were heard arguing over dinner the night before the murder.",

An online records search showed no criminal arrests for Dawson in Shelby County, which includes Memphis.",

      "Bieuville said it was extremely difficult to get an exact number of deaths and injuries after Mayotte was pummeled by the intense tropical cyclone on Saturday, causing major damage to public infrastructure, including the airport, flattening neighborhoods and knocking out electricity supplies.",
      "The French Interior Ministry confirmed at least 11 deaths and more than 250 injuries earlier Sunday but said that was expected to increase substantially.",
      "Mayotte, in the southwestern Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa, is France's poorest island and the poorest territory in the European Union. It has a population of just over 300,000 spread over two main islands.",
      "Bieuville said the worst devastation had been seen in the slums of metal shacks and informal structures that mark much of Mayotte. Referring to the official death toll so far, he said \"this figure is not plausible when you see the images of the slums.\"",
      "\"I think the human toll is much higher,\" he added.",
      "Chido blew through the southwestern Indian Ocean on Friday and Saturday, also affecting the nearby islands of Comoros and Madagascar. Mayotte was directly in the cyclone's path, though, and took the brunt. Chido brought winds in excess of 220 kph (136 mph), according to the French weather service, making it a category 4 cyclone, the second strongest on the scale.",
      "Later, Chido made landfall in Mozambique on the African mainland and there were fears for more than 2 million people in the country's north who could be impacted, according to authorities there.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron said his \"thoughts\" were with the Mayotte people and Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was due to travel to Mayotte on Monday. Retailleau had warned Saturday night after an emergency meeting in Paris that the death toll \"will be high,\" while new Prime Minister Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, who took office on Friday, said infrastructure had been severely damaged or destroyed across Mayotte.",
      "Pope Francis offered prayers for the victims while on a visit Sunday to the French Mediterranean island of Corsica.",
      "Rescuers and firefighters were sent from France and the nearby French territory of Reunion and supplies were also rushed in on military aircraft and ships. Damage to the airport's control tower meant only military aircraft were able to fly in.",
      "Patrice Latron, the prefect of Reunion, said authorities aim to establish an air and sea bridge from Reunion to Mayotte. About 800 more rescuers were to be sent in the coming days and more than 80 tons of supplies had been flown in or were on their way by ship. Some of the priorities were restoring electricity and access to drinking water, Latron said.",
      "The French Interior Ministry said 1,600 police and gendarmerie officers have been deployed to \"help the population and prevent potential looting.\"",
      "In some parts of Mayotte, entire neighborhoods of metal shacks and huts were flattened, while residents reported trees had been uprooted, boats flipped or sunk and many areas were without power.",
      "Chad Youyou, a resident in Hamjago in the north of the island, posted videos on Facebook showing the extensive damage in his village and across the surrounding fields and hills, where almost every tree had been leveled.",
      "\"Mayotte is destroyed \u2026 we are destroyed,\" he said.",

      "In Mozambique, UNICEF said Cabo Delgado province, home to around 2 million people, was the first region to be hit and many homes, schools and health facilities have been partially or completely destroyed.",
      "UNICEF Mozambique spokesman Guy Taylor said that communities faced the prospect of being cut off from schools and health facilities for weeks and Mozambique authorities warned there was a high danger of landslides.",
      "December through to March is cyclone season in the southwestern Indian Ocean and southern Africa has been pummeled by a series of strong ones in recent years. Cyclone Idai in 2019 killed more than 1,300 people, mostly in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Cyclone Freddy left more than 1,000 dead across several countries in the Indian Ocean and southern Africa last year.",
      "The cyclones bring the risk of flooding and landslides, but also stagnant pools of water may later spark deadly outbreaks of the waterborne disease cholera as well as dengue fever and malaria.",
      "Studies say the cyclones are getting worse because of climate change. They can leave poor countries in Africa, which contribute a tiny amount to global warming, having to deal with large humanitarian crises, underlining their call for more help from rich nations to deal with the impact of climate change.",

      "The rebel alliance that ousted Assad and broke his iron grip on the country just days ago faces a nation wracked and deeply isolated by tough international sanctions, which compounded Syria's previous economic troubles. But other challenges also complicate Syria's rebuilding: the new transitional leadership has not laid out a clear vision how the country will be governed, and the main group behind the offensive is saddled with a terrorist designation by the U.S.",

      "Pedersen traveled to Damascus to meet with officials from the new interim government set up by the former opposition forces who toppled Assad, led by the Islamic militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS. Officials in Washington have indicated that the Biden administration is considering removing the group's terror designation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that officials have been in direct contact with the group.",

      "They agreed that the new government should respect the rights of minorities and women, prevent terror groups from taking hold, ensure humanitarian aid reaches those in need, and secure and destroy any remaining Assad-era chemical weapons. Blinken has promised that the United States would recognize and support a new government that met those principles.",
      "A readout from President Biden's virtual call with the G7 leaders said they discussed \"the need for a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political transition process\" amid other issues in the Middle East.",
      "With the clock on the Biden administration running out, it isn't clear what approach President-elect Donald Trump will take on Syria.",
      "Syria's interim government is set to rule until March, but it has not yet made clear the process under which a new permanent administration would replace it.",
      "\"We need to get the political process underway that is inclusive of all Syrians,\" Pedersen said. \"That process obviously needs to be led by the Syrians themselves.\"",
      "He called for \"justice and accountability for crimes\" committed during the war and for the international community to step up humanitarian aid.",

      "The Constitutional Court has up to 180 days to determine whether to dismiss Yoon as president or restore his powers. If he's thrown out of office, a national election to choose his successor must be held within 60 days.",
      "It was the second National Assembly vote on Yoon's impeachment after ruling party lawmakers\u00a0boycotted the first floor vote last Saturday. Some People Power Party lawmakers had since said they would vote for Yoon's impeachment as public protests intensified and his approval rating plummeted.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, the leader of the opposition Democratic Party, told reporters Sunday that a swift ruling is the only way to minimize national chaos. Lee also said that the Democratic Party would not seek to impeach of Han, despite some calls to do so over his alleged inaction to prevent Yoon's martial law enforcement. Lee said there was no need to introduce further political uncertainty.",
      "Lee also proposed the creation of a national council where the government and the National Assembly would work together to stabilize state affairs. He said bipartisan cooperation is essential to navigating the political paralysis that has halted high-level diplomacy and spooked financial markets since Yoon's martial law decree.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik said Yoon's impeachment was an outcome driven by \"the people's ardent desire for democracy, courage and dedication.\"",
      "President Biden spoke with Han following the impeachment, the White House said in a statement Saturday night.",
      "\"President Biden expressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy and the rule of law in the ROK and reaffirmed the ironclad commitment of the United States to the people of the ROK,\" the statement read.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people gathered near the parliament roared in jubilation, waved banners and brandished colorful\u00a0K-pop glow sticks, as a lead activist shouted on stage, \"We have preserved the constitutional order!\"",
      "\"The impeachment has been done in line with the people's demand and I hope a decision to dismiss Yoon Suk Yeol will come as soon as possible,\" said Kim Su-bong, a protester. \"I'm very happy and moved. I view it as a victory of the people.\"",
      "In a central Seoul plaza, another huge crowd gathered supporting Yoon, but they grew subdued after hearing he had been impeached.",
      "The acting leader bolsters the country's security posture",
      "Yoon issued a statement saying he would \"never give up\" and calling for officials to maintain stability in government functions during what he described as a \"temporary\" pause of his presidency.",
      "\"I will carry with me all the criticisms, encouragement and support directed toward me, and I will continue to do my utmost for the country until the very last moment,\" Yoon said.",
      "Yoon's Dec. 3 imposition of martial law, the first of its kind in more than four decades in South Korea, lasted only six hours, but has caused massive political tumult, halted diplomatic activities and rattled financial markets. Yoon was forced to lift his decree after parliament unanimously voted to overturn it.",
      "Han, the acting leader, ordered the military to bolster its security posture to prevent North Korea from launching provocations by miscalculation. Han asked the foreign minister to inform other countries that South Korea's major external policies remain unchanged, and the finance minister to work to minimize potential negative impacts on the economy by the political turmoil, according to Han's office.",
      "\"I earnestly ask public servants this. At this moment, we have the critical task of ensuring normal and stable operations of state affairs ... I ask you to carry out your duties without any neglect to ensure that the government is operated without being shaken,\" Han said in a televised statement.",
      "South Korea's executive power is concentrated with the president, but the prime minister leads the country if the president becomes incapacitated. Han is a seasoned official and has previously held a string of top government posts such as trade minister and finance minister. He also served as a prime minister from 2007-2008.",
      "U.S. Ambassador Philip S. Goldberg wrote on X that the U.S. supports South Korea's \"democratic and constitutional process here and stands with its people.\" Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters Saturday that Tokyo was closely watching the developments in South Korea but said that \"the importance of Japan-South Korea relations is not affected.\"",
      "After declaring martial law, Yoon sent hundreds of troops and police officers to the parliament to try to impede its vote on the decree, before they withdrew after the parliament rejected Yoon's decree. No major violence occurred.",
      "Opposition parties accuse Yoon of rebellion, citing a law that categorizes as rebellion the staging of a riot against established state authorities to undermine the constitution. They also say that a president in South Korea is allowed to declare martial law only during wartime or similar emergencies and has no right to suspend parliament's operations even under martial law.",
      "The impeachment motion alleged that Yoon \"committed rebellion that hurt peace in the Republic of Korea by staging a series of riots.\" It said Yoon's mobilization of military and police forces threatened the National Assembly and the public and that his martial law decree was aimed at disturbing the constitution.",
      "Yoon remains defiant",
      "In a fiery speech on Thursday, Yoon rejected the rebellion charges, calling his martial law introduction an act of governance. The conservative Yoon said he aimed to issue a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, calling it \"a monster\" and \"anti-state forces\" that he argued has flexed its legislative muscle to impeach many top officials and undermine the government's budget bill for next year. He claimed the deployment of troops was meant to maintain order, rather than disrupt it.",
      "Lee called Yoon's speech a \"mad declaration of war\" against his own people.",
      "Observers say Yoon's speech suggested a focus on legal preparations to defend his martial law decree at the Constitutional Court, even as opinion surveys showed more than 70% of South Koreans supported his impeachment. A survey released Friday put Yoon's approval rating at 11%, the lowest since he took office in 2022.",
      "Some of Yoon's claims don't align with testimony by some military commanders whose troops were deployed to the Assembly.",
      "Kwak Jong-keun, commander of the Army Special Warfare Command, said that Yoon had asked for his troops to \"quickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\" Kwak said he didn't carry out Yoon's order.",
      "Yoon is the third South Korean president impeached while in office. In 2016, parliament impeached Park Geun-hye, the country's first female president, over a corruption scandal. The Constitutional Court upheld her impeachment and dismissed her from office.",
      "In 2004, President Roh Moo-hyun was impeached at parliament over an alleged election law violation but the court later overturned his impeachment and restored his presidential powers.",
      "Yoon has been banned from leaving South Korea. Yoon's defense minister and police chief and two other high-level figures have been arrested over the martial law enforcement.",
      "He has the presidential privilege of immunity from criminal prosecution but that doesn't extend to allegations of rebellion or treason. But observers doubt that authorities will forcefully detain him because of the potential for clashes with his presidential security service.",

      "U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that American officials have been in direct contact with the Syrian rebel group that spearheaded the overthrow of President Bashar al-Assad's government but is designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States and others.",
      "Blinken is the first U.S. official to publicly confirm contacts between the Biden administration and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led a coalition of armed opposition groups that ousted Assad from power last Sunday.",
      "Speaking at a news conference in Aqaba, Jordan, Blinken would not discuss details of the contacts but said it was important for the U.S. to convey messages to the group about its conduct and how it intends to govern in a transition period.",
      "\"Yes, we have been in contact with HTS and with other parties,\" Blinken said. He added that \"our message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we're prepared to help them do so.\"",
      "Blinken also said that officials are \"also communicating directly with those in positions of authority in Syria.\"",
      "HTS, which was once an affiliate of al-Qaida, has been designed as a foreign terrorist organization by the State Department since 2018. That designation carries with it severe sanctions, including a ban on the provision of any \"material support\" to the group or its members. The sanctions do not, however, legally bar U.S. officials from communicating with designated groups.",
      "In an interview Saturday on Syrian television, the group's leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, did not address any direct contact with the United States, but said the new authorities in Damascus, the capital, are in touch with Western embassies.",
      "HTS has worked to establish security and start a political transition after seizing Damascus and has tried to reassure a public both stunned by Assad's fall and concerned about extremist jihadis among the rebels. Insurgent leaders say the group has broken with its extremist past.",
      "Al-Sharaa appeared in a video message Friday congratulating \"the great Syrian people for the victory of the blessed revolution.\"",
      "U.S. officials say al-Sharaa has been making welcome comments about protecting minority and women's rights but remain skeptical that he will follow through on them in the long run.",
      "\"We know that what happens inside of Syria can have powerful consequences well beyond its borders, from mass displacement to terrorism, and we know that we can't underestimate the challenges of this moment and in the weeks and months ahead,\" Blinken said Saturday.",
      "On Friday, the rebels and Syria's unarmed opposition worked to safely turn over to U.S. officials an American man who had been imprisoned by Assad.",
      "Blinken said U.S. officials are continuing \"our own dogged, determined efforts\" as they search for Austin Tice, an American journalist who disappeared 12 years ago near Damascus.",

      "\"Isak has been an example for all of us. He dedicated his life to Mango, leaving an indelible mark thanks to his strategic vision, his inspiring leadership and his unwavering commitment to values that he himself imbued in our company,\" he added.",
      "The company did not provide further details about the accident. Spanish media said the 71-year-old died after falling while hiking with several members of his family near Barcelona.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a post on social media, \"My condolences to the family of Isak Andic, founder of Mango, on his tragic death in an accident in the Salnitre de Collbat\u00f3 caves.\" He added, \"All my love and recognition for your great work and business vision, which has turned this Spanish firm into a world leader in fashion.\"",
      "Mango traces its origins to 1984, when Andic, who is of Turkish origin, opened his first shop on the Paseo de Gracia, Barcelona's famous shopping street, with the help of his older brother Nahman.",
      "It was hugely successful. Spain had just emerged from a decades-long dictatorship that ended with the death of General Francisco Franco in 1975, and consumers were hungry for more modern clothes.",
      "\"His departure leaves a huge void, but we are all, in some way, his legacy and the testimony of his achievements. It is up to us, and this is the best tribute we can make to Isak and which we will fulfill, to ensure that Mango continues to be the project that Isak aspired to and of which he would be proud,\" Ruiz said.",

      "\"Parties need more time to agree on what's the best way forward to address the critical issue of drought,\" said Ibrahim Thiaw, the UNCCD chief, speaking at the end of the Riyadh talks.",

      "\"Our study indicates that one reason maintaining body weight after initial weight loss is difficult is that the fat cells remember their prior obese state and likely aim to return to this state,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"The body tends to defend increased body weight, making weight loss and maintenance notoriously challenging.\"",
      "\"This means one would have to \u2018fight\u2019 this obesogenic memory to maintain body weight.\"",
      "Based on this research, a failure to maintain weight loss after dieting is not necessarily due to lack of effort or willpower, but could also be driven by an underlying biological phenomenon, von Meyenn added.",
      "Potential limitations",
      "The research looked only at fatty tissue, and the genetic mechanisms were studied only in mice. Even so, the researchers said they believe that similar mechanisms also apply to humans.",
      "Other experts cautioned, however, that the study shows only association and does not prove that epigenetic changes cause the yo-yo effect.",
      "CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR NEXT MEAL? IT'S CALLED FOOD NOISE, HERE'S WHAT TO DO",
      "\"The authors pointed out that they cannot say for certain that the epigenetic modifications directly cause people to regain their lost weight, nor pinpoint which specific epigenetic markers may be driving this effect,\" Petronella Ravenshear, board-certified nutritionist and author of \"The Human Being Diet,\" told Fox News Digital.",
      "Florida-based Ravenshear, who was not part of the study, noted that the results should not lead people to claim, \"It\u2019s not my fault, it\u2019s my genes!\"",
      "Plans for future research",
      "\"We will need to now expand, see how the memory can be erased and whether other cells or tissues are also affected, [such as] the brain or the liver,\" von Meyenn said.",
      "It\u2019s possible that if people maintain a healthy weight for a year or longer after dieting, that may be enough time to erase the memory in fat cells, according to Ravenshear.",
      "The term \"diet,\" in its original connotation, means \"way of living\" \u2014 but it is now synonymous with short-term dietary changes that are unsustainable, one expert said. (iStock)",
      "\"This discovery underscores the importance of preventing obesity, particularly in children and adolescents, to avoid establishing this epigenetic memory that complicates long-term weight management,\" Stanford noted.",
      "\"Understanding these mechanisms further could lead to more effective treatments and prevention strategies, emphasizing the need for a proactive approach to weight management from an early age,\" she added.",

And so that means that the spending obligations that Congress and the government have incurred are a lot more than what we're going to bring in tax revenues,\" Matthew Dickerson, director of Budget Policy at EPIC, told Fox News Digital. \"To be able to pay the things the government has promised to pay on time, you need to increase the debt limit.\"",

      "Sadly, charity scams aren't new, but they are way more prevalent during the holiday season since scammers are hoping you're feeling more generous during this time of year. Sometimes, scammers may create fake names of organizations to get you to donate money, or they may reach out to you via phone/email/text posing as someone working for a legitimate charity. Social media has also become a popular place for charities to market themselves and reach more eyes in hopes of donations, so scammers may try to pose as fake charities. These schemes will try to appeal to your emotions during this season, so be sure to check where you donate your money so you don't fall for a scam.",
      "Never give your money to anyone immediately who approaches you or reaches out on behalf of any organization without doing your own independent research. Either do a little googling or check with a family member to see if it's real, and if it is, you should be able to donate to an official website or an official address. You can always mention this to anyone who asks you to donate somewhere. Don't fall into the pressure of donating right then and there. Also, always double-check the name of an organization. Sometimes (especially online), scammers will alter the name of a known organization slightly to trick you into donating.",

      "4) Gift card scams",
      "Gift card scams are another popular method that has been rising in popularity recently, but it's especially important to watch out for the possibilities, since you may be purchasing gift cards for friends or family for the holidays. Scammers often steal gift cards and use the information before they make it look like they didn't. They have a number of methods for tricking you using gift cards, so if you can send an online one (so that you can ensure you've purchased it on a legitimate, official website), that would be a much safer alternative.",
      "If you're getting anyone a gift card and buying it in person, be sure to check that the package hasn't been tampered with. Double-check that nothing on the packaging looks suspicious since scammers will try to make it seem like the package was sealed, but they will already have used the gift card, so you're essentially buying a useless piece of plastic.",

The Home Depot - You are our winner!\" along with a customer number and a blue circle that says, \"Check if you won.\" Who couldn't use a little extra cheer or perhaps a holiday prize from Home Depot this season?",
      "The problem is this is a scam, and the goal of this scam is to lure you into clicking on an embedded link, which can lead to various malicious outcomes. These include phishing for personal and financial information, installing malware on your device, redirecting to a fake website that resembles Home Depot's or prompting you to pay a \"delivery fee\" for a non-existent prize.",
      "To protect yourself from this and similar scams, scrutinize the sender's email address for any discrepancies. Hover over links without clicking to reveal their true destination. Be wary of unexpected \"winnings\" or requests for confirmation. If you receive an email that raises suspicion, contact Home Depot directly through their official website or customer service number to verify its legitimacy. Finally, remember that legitimate companies will not ask you to confirm sensitive information via email or require you to click on links to claim prizes.",

      "We\u2019re sorry to hear about the theft in your neighborhood. This highlights a problem that goes beyond mere property loss. It's a theft of holiday cheer and personal effort. Let\u2019s see how we can use technology to help secure your decorations.",

      "Karen also inquired about the effectiveness of\u00a0Samsung SmartTags, asking if these tags would work on her decorations and how far they could reach. The good news is that Samsung SmartTags can indeed be used on your holiday decorations. You can attach the SmartTag to any item you want to track. These devices are compatible with most recent Samsung Galaxy phones, including the Galaxy S9, making them accessible to many Android users.",
      "As for the distance, the range of the\u00a0Samsung SmartTag uses Bluetooth to connect to your phone. If the item is within Bluetooth range, you can ring it to find it or use the \"Search Nearby\" feature to get directions to it. If the item is out of range, other Samsung devices near the tag will anonymously locate it for you and then let you know where it is. This is done in the background and is encrypted to ensure privacy. The SmartTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range.",
      "The\u00a0Samsung SmartTag is compatible with almost all Samsung Galaxy phones released recently. They must have 2GB of RAM and run Android 8.0 (Oreo) or higher. So, your Samsung Galaxy S9 phones should be compatible with the Samsung SmartTag.",

While primarily designed for iOS devices,\u00a0you can use it with your Android phone as mentioned in our article here, with some limitations. It uses the Find My network, and if another Apple device passes by the AirTag, the Find My network will be notified of the lost item\u2019s location.",
      "The AirTag does not beep when it\u2019s out of range. However, the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature, which provides highly accurate tracking, is only compatible with iPhone 11 series and onwards. If you\u2019re considering purchasing an iPhone, the iPhone 11 would be a relatively inexpensive option that is compatible with the AirTag\u2019s Precision Finding feature.",

Similarly,\u00a0AirTags leverage the Find My network, utilizing nearby Apple devices to relay location information.",
      "For Samsung users like Karen, the\u00a0SmartTag is the natural choice, working seamlessly with Galaxy devices. Those considering Apple might look at the\u00a0AirTag\u00a0as an option.",

      "10 THINGS YOU MUST CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING ANY SECURITY CAMERA",
      "1. Use motion-activated cameras: Install\u00a0motion-activated security cameras to monitor your decorations. Many security cameras send real-time notifications to your phone, allowing you to act quickly if someone tampers with your property.",
      "2. Secure decorations: Consider physically securing your decorations with zip ties, chains or locks. While this won't deter all thieves, it can make stealing more difficult and time-consuming.",
      "3. Light it up: Well-lit areas are less appealing to thieves. Ensure your yard and decorations are adequately lit with\u00a0outdoor lights, especially in dark corners or near entry points.",
      "4. Engage your neighbors: Create a sense of community by alerting neighbors to thefts and keeping an eye out for suspicious activity. A connected neighborhood can act as a strong deterrent.",
      "5. Mark your property: Use invisible ink or engrave your decorations with a unique identifier. If stolen items are recovered, this will help law enforcement return them to you.",
      "6. Report thefts to local law enforcement: Always report thefts, no matter how small. Law enforcement can track patterns and increase patrols in areas with frequent incidents. Providing details may also help them recover stolen items.",

      "Data breaches are becoming alarmingly common, and it\u2019s no longer just massive corporations or government agencies in the crosshairs. Hackers are setting their sights on personal devices like your smartphone. Think about it, your phone holds a staggering amount of your personal information.",
      "From emails and text messages to banking apps, social media and even your photos, it's a treasure trove for cybercriminals.",
      "The numbers back up the growing threat. The FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center received nearly 56,000 reports of personal data breaches last year. California, the most populous state, topped the charts for the most complaints, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center (ITRC). These stats are more than just numbers \u2014 they\u2019re a wake-up call.",

      "So, what happens if you find your phone has been hacked?",
      "It\u2019s a nightmare scenario. Your phone feels off \u2014 battery drains faster than usual, strange pop-ups appear, apps you didn\u2019t download show up, or you\u2019re suddenly locked out. Maybe it\u2019s sluggish, overheating or making unexpected calls or texts. Your mind races: \"What did they see? What can they do with my information? Can I even fix this?\"",
      "Take a deep breath. Yes, it\u2019s unsettling, but you\u2019re not powerless. Knowing what steps to take \u2014 and in what order \u2014 can make a huge difference in regaining control and stopping the damage. Let\u2019s walk through exactly what to do if your phone gets hacked, so you can protect yourself and bounce back stronger.",

      "Step 1: Remove malicious software",
      "Even if hackers had only brief access to your device, assume they\u2019ve seen sensitive data. Your first task is to remove any malware or spyware.",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software: The easiest and most effective way to start is by installing and running strong antivirus or antivirus software. Avoid unfamiliar apps, as some pose as antivirus tools but are actually malware in disguise.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "After installation, run a full device scan. This will search for hidden threats like spyware, ransomware, or keyloggers that could compromise your information further. Once the scan identifies malicious files, follow the app\u2019s instructions to quarantine or remove them. Be sure to double-check the app\u2019s log to confirm all suspicious activity has been addressed. Most antivirus tools offer real-time protection to monitor for threats as they occur. Turn this feature on to reduce the risk of reinfection. Antivirus programs are only as effective as their latest updates. Cybercriminals continuously develop new malware, so keeping your antivirus database current ensures it can detect the newest threats.",
      "2. Factory reset if needed: If the antivirus software fails to fully restore your phone\u2019s functionality \u2014 such as fixing issues like freezing, slowdowns or unexpected shutdowns \u2014 you may need to perform a factory reset on your\u00a0iPhone or\u00a0Android. A factory reset wipes all data from your phone, returning it to its original state when it left the manufacturer. Before resetting, create a backup of your important files. However, ensure the backup itself is free of malware. Use antivirus software to scan backups before restoring them. Most phones offer a simple reset option in their settings menu under \"System\" or \"General Management.\" Consult your device manual or manufacturer\u2019s website for detailed instructions.",
      "3. Seek professional help:\u00a0If you\u2019re not confident in your ability to remove malware or reset your phone, reach out to a trusted professional. Visit the Apple Store, Microsoft Store or an authorized service provider for your phone brand. Explain your situation and ask for a thorough inspection and cleaning of your device. Many retailers offer comprehensive diagnostic and repair services.",
      "4. Abandon hardware only as a last resort: In rare cases, malware can deeply embed itself into a device, making complete removal nearly impossible. If your phone continues to exhibit signs of infection despite using antivirus tools, factory resets and professional help, you may need to replace it. Ensure you completely\u00a0wipe the device before disposing of it to prevent any residual data from falling into the wrong hands. When setting up a new device, take extra precautions to secure it, such as enabling\u00a0two-factor authentication and keeping all\u00a0software up to date.",

      "EV delivery truck being tested in winter conditions (Harbinger)",
      "Innovative design for superior handling",
      "Harbinger's EV delivery truck features a unique chassis design that places the heavy batteries within the frame, resulting in a much lower center of gravity compared to traditional medium-duty trucks. This innovative layout allows for powerful torque and superior handling, even for vehicles exceeding 13 feet in length. The result is a truck that handles more like a passenger car, even in challenging winter conditions.",

      "TESLA SEMI'S IMPRESSIVE PERFORMANCE ON ICE MARKS ANOTHER MAJOR TRIUMPH",
      "Key elements of winter testing",
      "According to John Harris, co-founder and CEO of Harbinger, winter testing is critical for vehicle development, especially for EVs. It ensures that vehicles perform reliably on low-traction surfaces such as ice and snow. The focus is not only on typical cold weather driving conditions but also on less common yet important higher-risk scenarios. This is particularly crucial for EVs due to their significant torque output, which can lead to loss of control if not managed correctly on slippery surfaces. Systems like regenerative braking also need optimization for extreme conditions.",

At low temperatures, the chemical reactions within the battery slow down, leading to decreased efficiency and power output. Additionally, electric vehicles require energy to heat the cabin, which further reduces driving range. Harbinger addresses these concerns by utilizing a multi-zone heat pump that efficiently provides heating for both the battery and cabin, thereby minimizing the negative effects of cold weather on performance.",

    "summary": "Kurt &quot;CyberGuy&quot; Knutsson tackles blockchain scams, which are often disguised as legitimate offers that promise easy investment returns.",
    "story": [
      "The \"CyberGuy\" addresses potential blockchain scams.",
      "Blockchain scams are increasingly prevalent, and it\u2019s essential to understand what they are and how to recognize them before they take a toll on your finances.",
      "For instance, John from Sunset Beach, North Carolina, recently reached out with a pressing question about some suspicious messages he\u2019s been receiving in his inbox.",
      "\"I have been receiving messages from this site for a while. Can you tell me if this is a scam or real? I don't want to pay good money to get scammed.\"",
      "Cryptocurrency scam email (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "John's experience is not unique; many individuals find themselves in similar situations when confronted with potential blockchain scams. These scams can take various forms, often disguised as legitimate offers or services that promise easy returns on investments. Let's look at the common signs of these scams, why they are so prevalent and what steps you can take to protect yourself from becoming a victim.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS - SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER - THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "What is a blockchain scam?",
      "A blockchain scam refers to a deceptive scheme aimed at tricking you into losing your money or digital assets within the cryptocurrency space. As the popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to rise, so does the prevalence of these scams, which exploit the lack of regulation and the anonymity often associated with blockchain technology. In essence, blockchain scams come in various forms, each designed to mislead and defraud unsuspecting victims.",
      "One of the most common types is the \"Pump and Dump\" scheme. In this scenario, scammers artificially inflate the price of a low-value cryptocurrency by spreading false information or hype. Once the price reaches a certain level, they sell off their holdings, causing the price to plummet and leaving other investors with significant losses.",
      "Another notorious scam is the Initial Coin Offering scam. Here, fraudsters promote a new cryptocurrency project with promises of high returns and innovative technology. However, once they collect funds from investors, they often vanish without delivering any product or service, leaving investors with worthless tokens.",
      "Phishing scams are also rampant in the blockchain world. Scammers impersonate legitimate cryptocurrency platforms or services to trick you into providing sensitive information such as private keys or login credentials. Once they gain access to a victim's wallet, they can easily transfer funds to their own accounts.",
      "Additionally, there are fraudulent giveaway schemes where scammers promise to double or triple an individual's cryptocurrency holdings if they send a specific amount to a designated wallet. After sending their funds, victims find that the promised rewards never materialize.",
      "Scammers may also create clone platforms, which mimic popular cryptocurrency exchanges or wallet services. Unsuspecting users believe they are using a legitimate platform and deposit their digital currencies, only to have them stolen by fraudsters.",
      "A man holding cryptocurrency coins (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DON'T GET CAUGHT IN THE 'APPLE ID SUSPENDED' PHISHING SCAM",
      "Identifying the red flags of cryptocurrency scams",
      "Here are some of the common elements of such cryptocurrency scam emails.",
      "Unsolicited contact: Legitimate crypto services don\u2019t randomly reach out offering free money. If you receive an unexpected email claiming you\u2019ve won cryptocurrency or are entitled to a payment, it\u2019s a strong indicator that something is off.",
      "Pressure to act: Scammers often create a sense of urgency to push you into making hasty decisions. Phrases like \"Act now!\" or \"Limited time offer!\" are red flags that should make you pause and think twice before responding.",
      "Requests for payment: Any service asking for upfront fees to receive crypto is likely a scam. Genuine platforms will never require you to pay before delivering funds or services. So, be wary of any requests for payment in advance.",
      "Suspicious links: Scammers often embed links in emails or messages that lead to phishing sites designed to steal your credentials. Always hover over links to see where they lead before clicking, and if anything looks suspicious, don\u2019t engage. If you have any doubts about a link's legitimacy, it\u2019s best to avoid clicking on it altogether.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Now, you might be wondering, \"How did these scammers get my info in the first place?\" Great question. Let\u2019s take a quick look at how they manage to dig up your personal details \u2013 more than likely through the shady world of data harvesting.",
      "Data breaches: Companies get hacked, and your info gets leaked faster than gossip at a high school reunion. Always monitor your accounts for unusual activity.",
      "Public records: Scammers can piece together your life story from publicly available information, everything from property records to social media profiles.",
      "Social media oversharing: That cute dog pic you posted? It might reveal more than you think about where you live or what you do for fun.",
      "Phishing attacks: Clicking on that \"You won\u2019t believe what happened next!\" link could lead to malware that steals your data faster than you can say \"blockchain.\" The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Cryptocurrency on an app on a smartphone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "IS JUST READING THAT SKETCHY SCAMMER'S EMAIL DANGEROUS, OR DO I HAVE TO CLICK ON A LINK TO GET IN TROUBLE?",
      "Protecting yourself from blockchain scams",
      "Given the decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, scams pose significant challenges in terms of tracing and recovering lost funds. Therefore, it\u2019s essential for anyone participating in the crypto space to stay informed about these scams, exercise caution when engaging in transactions and follow the steps below.",
      "1. Verify independently: Always log in to your accounts directly, not through email links. Scammers often create fake websites that look almost identical to legitimate ones, so it's crucial to enter URLs manually or use bookmarks for trusted sites. This simple practice can prevent you from falling victim to phishing attempts.",
      "2. Use strong authentication: Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication on all your crypto accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring not just your password but also a second form of verification, such as a text message code or an authentication app. Even if someone manages to steal your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without this additional verification.",
      "3. Be skeptical: If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Scammers often lure victims with promises of guaranteed returns or exclusive investment opportunities. Always approach such offers with skepticism and conduct thorough research before making any commitments.",
      "4. Check email addresses: Scammers frequently use domains that look similar to legitimate ones, so always double-check the email address from which a message originates. A small typo or a different domain can indicate a scam. If you're unsure, reach out directly to the company using contact information from their official website.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and antivirus software are up to date.\u00a0Regular updates often include security patches that protect against vulnerabilities that scammers might exploit. Keeping your software current is a critical step in safeguarding your digital assets.",
      "6. Consider using a data removal service: Personal data removal services can help scrub your personal information from the web, making it harder for scammers to target you with personalized phishing attempts. By reducing your digital footprint, you can significantly decrease the chances of being targeted by malicious actors.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your personal data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Remember, in the world of crypto, vigilance is your best friend. If you're ever unsure about an email or offer, it's always better to err on the side of caution. Don't hesitate to reach out to official support channels. Stay safe out there, and may your crypto wallets always be full (and scam-free).",

      "Patricia Heaton, the Emmy-winning star of shows including \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" and \"The Middle,\" has been an outspoken advocate for Israel and the Jewish people. She discussed what inspired her to take action during a conversation with Fox News Digital that took place right before she received an award for her efforts from the American Friends of Magen David Adom (MDA), Israel's version of the Red Cross.",
      "\"I just thought it was common knowledge that we all know the history of the Jewish people and especially of the Holocaust, and it was always never again; and it happened again, and I didn't see the kind of outrage that I expected,\" Heaton said. \"And I don't know why, but I felt that I had to say something because it is outrageous what happened.\"",

    "summary": "Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland announced her resignation from Justin Trudeau&apos;s Cabinet on Monday, a powerful blow to the Liberal Prime Minister&apos;s hold on the government.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau faced the biggest test of his political career after Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, long one of his most powerful and loyal ministers, announced Monday that she was resigning from the Cabinet.",
      "The stunning move raised questions about how much longer the prime minister of nearly 10 years can stay on in his role as his administration scrambles to deal with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Trudeau's popularity has plummeted due to concerns about inflation and immigration.",
      "Opposition leader Jagmeet Singh, whose party Trudeau's ruling Liberals have relied upon to stay in power, called on Trudeau to resign. The main opposition Conservatives demanded an election.",
      "Freeland, who was also deputy prime minister, said that Trudeau had told her Friday that he no longer wanted her to serve as finance minister and that he offered her another role in the Cabinet. But she said in her resignation letter to the prime minister that the only \"honest and viable path\" was to leave the Cabinet.",
      "CANADIAN PREMIER THREATENS TO CUT OFF ENERGY IMPORTS TO US IF TRUMP IMPOSES TARIFF ON COUNTRY",
      "\"For the past number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds about the best path forward for Canada,\" Freeland said.",
      "Freeland and Trudeau disagreed about a two-month sales tax holiday and $250 Canadian ($175) checks to Canadians that were recently announced. Freeland said that Canada is dealing with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose sweeping 25% tariffs and should eschew \"costly political gimmicks\" it can \"ill afford.\"",
      "\"Our country is facing a grave challenge,\" Freeland said in the letter. \"That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a coming tariff war.\"",
      "A Liberal party official said Freeland was offered a position as minister in charge of Canada-U.S. relations without portfolio and without a department. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the position would have been in name only and wouldn't have come with any of the tools Freeland previously had when she negotiated trade with the U.S.",
      "The resignation comes as Freeland, who chaired a Cabinet committee on U.S. relations, was set to deliver the fall economic statement and likely announce border security measures designed to help Canada avoid Trump's tariffs. The U.S. president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the numbers of migrants and drugs.",
      "Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland delivers remarks on Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Wednesday, Dec. 11, 2024. (Spencer Colby/The Canadian Press via AP)",
      "Trudeau has said that he plans on leading the Liberal Party into the next election, but some party members have said they don't want him to run for a fourth term, and Freeland's departure came as strong blow to Trudeau's administration.",
      "\"This news has hit me really hard,\" Transport Minister Anita Anand said, adding that she needed to digest the news before commenting further.",
      "Opposition Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said that the government is losing control at the worst possible time.",
      "\"Justin Trudeau has lost control, but he's hanging onto power,\" Poilievre said. \"All this chaos, all this division, all this weakness is happening as our largest neighbor and closest ally is imposing 25% tariffs under a recently elected Trump with a strong mandate, a man who knows how to identify weakness.\"",
      "No Canadian prime minister in more than a century has won four straight terms.",
      "The federal election has to be held before October. The Liberals must rely on the support of at least one other major party in Parliament, because they don\u2019t hold an outright majority themselves. If the opposition New Democratic Party, or NDP, pulls support, an election can be held at any time.",
      "\"I\u2019m calling on Justin Trudeau to resign. He has to go,\" NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said.",
      "Trudeau\u2019s Liberal party needs the support of the NDP party to stay in power. Singh didn't say if he would note no confidence in the government but said all options are on the table.",
      "\"Mr. Trudeau\u2019s government is over,\" Opposition Bloc Quebecois leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blanchet said. \"He must acknowledge that and act accordingly. The departure of his most important ally, his finance minister, is the end of this government.\"",
      "Trudeau channeled the star power of his father in 2015, when he reasserted the country\u2019s liberal identity after almost a decade of Conservative Party rule. But the son of late Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is now in big trouble. Canadians have been frustrated by the rising cost of living and other issues like immigration increases following the country\u2019s emergence from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"As a country we have to project strength,\" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said. \"It\u2019s chaos right now up in Ottawa.\"",
      "Trudeau\u2019s legacy includes opening the doors wide to immigration. He also legalized cannabis and brought in a carbon tax intended to fight climate change.",
      "Freeland said in the resignation letter that Canadians \"know when we are working for them, and they equally know when we are focused on ourselves. Inevitably, our time in government will come to an end.\"",
      "Freeland's resignation comes as Trudeau has been trying to recruit Mark Carney to join his government. Carney is the former head of the Bank of England and Bank of Canada.",
      "He was so well regarded after helping Canada dodge the worst of the global economic crisis that the U.K. named him the first foreigner to serve as governor of the Bank of England since it was founded in 1694.",
      "Carney has long been interested in entering politics and becoming the leader of the Liberal Party. It wasn't immediately clear if Carney has agreed to join Trudeau's Cabinet.",
      "\"This is quite a bombshell,\" said Nelson Wiseman, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto. \"Freeland was not only finance minister but also deputy prime minister and, until a couple of years ago, was seen as Trudeau\u2019s heir as Liberal leader and prime minister.\"",
      "Wiseman said that leaks from the prime minister\u2019s office suggest that she was a poor communicator and made Freeland\u2019s status questionable.",
      "\"There was talk about her becoming foreign minister again and that would have been a good fit for her, but the stab in the back from the prime minister's office cast the die,\" Wiseman said.",
      "Daniel B\u00e9land, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal, also called it a political earthquake and not just because Freeland was the second most powerful official in government.",
      "\"Also because of how she resigned: by publishing a letter on social media that clearly criticizes the prime minister only hours before she was supposed to present the government\u2019s fall economic statement,\" B\u00e9land said.",

    "title": "China is creating fake stories to undermine congressional support for Taiwan, FBI warns",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 23:34:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The FBI has warned lawmakers in classified briefings that the Chinese Communist Party is crafting fake stories to portray them in a negative light because of their support for Taiwan.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The FBI has held classified briefings warning a handful of U.S. lawmakers that the Chinese Communist Party is working to create fake stories to portray them in a negative light because of their hawkish views of Beijing and support for Taiwan, two U.S. officials familiar with the briefings told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the briefings, said that one of the false stories being concocted by the CCP, cited by FBI briefers, is that these lawmakers are espousing pro-Taiwan views because they were taking \u201cbribes\u201d from Taiwan.",
      "\u201cThe CCP is trying to undermine congressional support for Taiwan\u2019s democracy, to paint it as corrupt and not in the American public interest,\u201d one of the two U.S. officials told NBC News. \u201cIt will not work.\u201d",
      "The officials said the briefings occurred in the fall.",
      "A third source, a House lawmaker who specializes in national security matters, said they had been informed about the alleged CCP scheme but had not personally received a briefing.",
      "The FBI had no comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to an emailed request for comment about this story.",
      "The classified discussions were described as \u201cdefensive\u201d briefings, the U.S. officials said, meaning the alleged CCP scheme had not been carried out yet, but the FBI wanted to share critical information with the intended targets as a way to pre-empt the attacks.",
      "The FBI commonly provides defensive briefings to senior officials when the bureau learns they have been targeted by foreign intelligence operations.",
      "Tensions between Beijing and Washington have escalated in recent years, particularly over the future of the island of Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy and a critical U.S. ally in Asia that China claims as its territory.",
      "In 2022, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., an outspoken critic of China\u2019s human rights violations, made an unannounced visit to Taiwan and was awarded the highest civilian honor by its president. She was the highest-ranking U.S. official to set foot in Taiwan since former Speaker Newt Gingrich did it in 1997, and the move infuriated officials in Beijing, which launched military exercises around Taiwan including live-fire drills.",
      "Other lawmakers have made similar trips to Taipei. In February, bipartisan members of the special House committee investigating the CCP traveled to Taiwan to congratulate Lai Ching-te, the pro-independence candidate who had been elected president just weeks earlier. And this past May, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, led a bipartisan group of six lawmakers on an official congressional visit to Taiwan to meet with Lai.",
      "Several members of the House Intelligence Committee and select House committee on the CCP declined to comment when asked if they had received a classified briefing on the matter. Lawmakers are prohibited from speaking publicly about any such classified briefings.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., the chairman of the select House committee on the CCP, had no comment about any specific plot by the CCP, but said it was no secret Beijing has been targeting U.S. officials and other Americans.",
      "\u201cThe CCP will try to discredit our way of life, our freedoms and will use every means necessary,\u201d Moolenaar told NBC News. \u201cSo you know, whether it\u2019s hacking high-level officials\u2019 communications, we can expect all these things.\u201d",
      "Starting with the 2022 midterm elections, China has adopted increasingly sophisticated and aggressive tactics to try to aggravate political divisions in American society and undermine congressional candidates that Beijing deems hostile to the regime\u2019s interests, especially over the status of Taiwan, according to U.S. intelligence officials and researchers.",
      "In the 2024 presidential contest, China did not appear to favor either candidate but instead focused on specific downballot races with covert disinformation campaigns, using artificial intelligence tools and fake accounts mimicking Americans. The candidates targeted included McCaul; Rep. Barry Moore, R-Ala.; and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., according to an analysis from Microsoft.\u00a0A Chinese Embassy spokesperson said at the time that the claims were \"full of malicious speculations\" and that China had \"no intention\" to and would \"not interfere in the U.S. election.\"",
      "U.S. intelligence officials and analysts say China\u2019s efforts to stoke polarization and undercut Americans\u2019 confidence in the democratic process are part of a long-term effort that includes global information operations designed to tarnish America\u2019s image abroad.",
      "China\u2019s disinformation efforts have coincided with what U.S. officials say is a concerted effort to steal intellectual property and U.S. military secrets through espionage and cyber hacks.",
      "Earlier this month, the White House said that a Chinese hacking campaign targeting the U.S. and other countries was more sweeping and serious than previously known. The CCP had spied on the texts and calls of U.S. citizens by hacking at least eight American telecommunications companies, according to a White House official.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington responded to that allegation in a statement this month: \u201cChina firmly opposes the US\u2019s smear attacks against China without any factual basis.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 18:27:22 GMT",
    "summary": "Film director RaMell Ross is unapologetic about his focus on the Black South in his work, including his latest film \u2018Nickel Boys.\u2019",
    "story": [
      "Film director RaMell Ross is unapologetic about his focus on the Black South in his work. His first feature-length documentary, \u201cHale County This Morning, This Evening,\u201d captures the educational experiences, the class struggles and the reverberations of Jim Crow segregation in an Alabama community, earning him an Oscar nomination in 2019.",
      "\u201cNickel Boys,\u201d Ross\u2019 first narrative feature, falls in line with his professional and personal mission. He and producer Joslyn Barnes adapted the film from Colson Whitehead\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2019 novel \u201cThe Nickel Boys.\u201d",
      "The story is set at the fictional Nickel Academy, based on the notoriously cruel Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys near Tallahassee, Florida, which operated for 111 years before being shut down by the Department of Justice in 2011. Far worse than the white children in the institution\u2019s charge, Black children were physically and emotionally abused in the hundreds with no accountability. Nearly 100 teens and boys \u2014 and possibly more \u2014 died on its grounds, with many buried in unmarked graves.",
      "\u201cIt seemed perfect for me to adapt,\u201d said Ross, who lives part time in Alabama. \u201cI was a Black boy, and I can see myself specifically in Elwood because I grew up with a lot of love. I was a really, really, really good kid because I was afraid something small would happen and it would just escalate, and life would be derailed, and I\u2019d let my parents down and everything they\u2019ve done would go to waste.\u201d",
      "For Ross, \u201cNickel Boys\u201d is also very much tied to his acclaimed documentary.",
      "\u201cI think I made an unintentional proof of concept when I made \u2018Hale County This Morning, This Evening,\u2019 and the aesthetics of this film are an evolution of that,\u201d he admitted.",
      "Of the two main characters in \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d Jack Turner, played by Brandon Wilson, is more seasoned and he befriends the more na\u00efve Elwood Curtis, whose bright future as a college student in the early 1960s ends when he accepts a ride from an older Black man in a stolen car.",
      "Turner and Elwood offer the audience entry into the heinous world of Nickel, a segregated juvenile correctional facility for boys. Unlike Turner, Elwood, played by Ethan Herisse, has a loving grandmother Hattie, played by Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, who does her best to protect him as a child and fights to free him from Dozier.",
      "Ross said it was important that the actors playing Elwood and Turner seem timeless. \u201cThere\u2019s something about making historical productions or exploring history in which we over-index on the symbolism, the speech, the clothing and the background, the environment, that pushes it into this bizarre capsule of history,\u201d he explained.",
      "\u201cI would argue there\u2019s something unconscious that happens, in which you\u2019re like, \u2018They\u2019re not like us. They\u2019re not the exact same as us. Or there\u2019s something different. Times were different,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cWe were insistent on finding two boys that felt like now, that could also feel like then, which is kind of now, which is also then.\u201d",
      "Ross also shared his awe of Ellis-Taylor, whom he, along with Herisse and Wilson, presented the Social Impact Award for their film during the Critics Choice Association Celebration of Black Cinema & Television in Los Angeles this month.",
      "\u201cShe actually lives the character, which is a little bit distressing when the scenes are really, really emotional because we shoot them four or five times,\u201d he said.",
      "But Ellis-Taylor knows it is part of the job.",
      "\u201cThis is the kind of work that I want to do,\u201d said Ellis-Taylor, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her role in 2021\u2019s \u201cKing Richard,\u201d and is beginning to receive Oscar buzz for \u201cNickel Boys.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m beyond blessed to work with someone like RaMell Ross, to work with Ethan Herisse, to work with Brandon Wilson, and to be a part of storytelling that I feel gives some justice to those children at the Dozier School.\u201d",
      "Determining how to present the brutality of this painful history without glorifying it or morphing it into trauma porn was a huge challenge for Ross, who is more than aware of how irresponsibly violence against Black bodies has historically been captured in photography, film and even on the news.",
      "In contrast, Ross pondered ways to capture how \u201csomatic, psychological and completely absorbed\u201d that brutality is. It comes through in the way the film is shot through various characters\u2019 point of view.",
      "Accolades for Ross indicate that the critics like his approach. He\u2019s already won best director honors from the Gotham Awards and the New York Film Critics Circle Awards and received a Critics Choice Awards nomination. As a film, \u201cNickel Boys,\u201d which also stars Daveed Diggs in a small but important role, has received several best picture nods, including the Golden Globes.",
      "\u201cThe story is pretty heartbreaking,\u201d Ross admitted, but added that \u201cI think the ending is ultimately hopeful.\u201d He sees it as \u201cthe sort of redemption that a lot of folks are looking for when they watch\u201d a sad, heavy film.",
      "However, that hope, he shared, \u201ccomes in a way that\u2019s more conceptual.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d main character Player 456 may have slipped on the iconic green tracksuit and returned in the show\u2019s upcoming second season for another round in the murderous survival game. But he\u2019s no longer focused solely on his own win, now carrying the weight of his fellow contestants on his shoulders.",
      "Lee Jung-jae, who reprises his role as game winner Seong Gi-hun in the new season that begins streaming on Netflix on Dec. 26, said that this time around, his character is darker and more serious after a traumatic first season.",
      "He told NBC News he also has a mission to save others who have joined the high-pressure, high-stakes game. The character development even prompted the actor himself to evolve, he said.",
      "\u201cWhen actors really immerse themselves into their characters, I think sometimes their values can shift according to what the character thinks,\u201d Lee said in Korean through a translator. \u201c\u2018Squid Game\u2019 really talks about justice and how to bring people together. And I really thought about that a lot, too.\u201d",
      "In the upcoming season, a traumatized Gi-hun gives up his plan to hop on a plane for the U.S. with his winnings. Instead, he chooses to re-enter the game three years later with the sole purpose of putting an end to it. Surrounded by a new crop of players, Gi-hun looks to protect them all from the violence that comes with the tempting game winnings of 45.6 billion won.",
      "While the first season features a rather optimistic Gi-hun, still naive to the depth of the game\u2019s horrors, the second season shows a hardened man, who\u2019s only focused on his noble task. And with such universal themes at play including greed, humanity and temptation, Lee said he hopes that fans find the show not only entertaining, but also an opportunity for introspection.",
      "\u201cI hope that people watching the show would also have some time to reflect on human nature and think about whether we are on the right path \u2014 if we are on the path to making the world a better place, or are we going the other way around,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The upcoming season, which has already received a Golden Globe nod for best drama series, was no less daunting to make than the show\u2019s first, wildly successful season. Lee said that he was equally stressed, bringing the two versions of Gi-hun to light. And director Hwang Dong-hyuk, who said he lost seven teeth while making the first season, said the show was up against some high expectations and noise this time.",
      "\u201cBecause season one was so globally loved, when it was decided that there was going to be a second season, it\u2019s true that I felt a huge amount of pressure,\u201d Hwang said. \u201cSo many people out there were saying, \u2018Season one was perfect. Why don\u2019t you just end it with season one?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hwang added that there were concerns he would \u201cdisappoint the world\u201d and ruin his reputation with another season.",
      "\u201cBut rather than have that weigh negatively on me, I tried to use that as a creative catalyst and a drive for me,\u201d he said."

    "published": "Mon, 16 Dec 2024 18:04:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer asked for high-tech drone-detection equipment from Robin Radar Systems, a Netherlands-based company.",
    "story": [
      "Gotham has Batman, but New York wants Robin.",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said this weekend that the Department of Homeland Security should send special drone-detection technology made by Robin Radar Systems to New York and New Jersey following a series of mysterious sightings.",
      "\u201cIf the technology exists for a drone to make it up into the sky, there certainly is the technology that can track the craft with precision and determine what the heck is going on,\u201d Schumer told reporters on Sunday.",
      "Schumer said he is requesting Robin\u2019s equipment in part because it uses \u201cnot a linear line of sight, but 360-degree technology that has a much better chance of detecting these drones.\u201d",
      "In recent years, the Netherlands-based Robin Radar Systems has risen in prominence, though its hardware is not only used to track down drones.",
      "Robin is part of a consortium developing small radar satellites that can measure water levels, according to the Netherlands Space Office. In February, the company also deployed four bird-detection radars to support the creation of what has been billed as the world\u2019s most ecological wind farm in the Dutch part of the North Sea.",
      "Follow along for live coverage",
      "In early October 2023, Robin announced it had joined a group of organizations working on the development of the world\u2019s most advanced weather radar, known as PHARA. The group\u2019s mission is to \u201cdevelop a fully 3D weather radar that can accurately track the movement and growth process of cloud particles and large-scale weather fronts.\u201d",
      "\u201cDetecting small objects is what we do, and it\u2019s what we do best,\u201d the company says on its website. \u201cBird, bat, or drone, our 360\u00b0 radar systems log thousands of observations, scanning every second to track and classify with precision.\u201d",
      "Robin\u2019s systems have been used in at least one notable military context, too. In early August, the Dutch Ministry of Defense announced it had purchased 51 drone radars from the company and planned to donate them to Ukraine as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s forces attempt to fend off Russia\u2019s aerial assault.",
      "In a news release announcing the purchase, Robin explained that \u201ctraditional radar systems are typically stationary, mounted on fixed platforms like buildings or tripods.\u201d But the Robin-produced radar systems have \u201con-the-move\u201d functionality, allowing them to \u201cperform even when mounted on mobile objects, like vehicles or ships.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobin\u2019s 3D drone detection radars \u2026 are designed with the explicit purpose of detecting small, fast and elusive drones,\u201d the company said.",
      "The deployment of Robin technology could come as a relief to residents in the New York and New Jersey areas who have been rattled by the bright, unidentified flying objects hovering above their homes almost every night for weeks.",
      "The objects have appeared in the sky since at least Nov. 18. It remains unclear who is operating the devices. The Pentagon has insisted the objects are not owned by the military.",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Monday, Robin Radar Systems general manager Kristian Brost said the company\u2019s radars can detect a drone in the sky, but \u201cwe can\u2019t tell you who\u2019s flying it [or] what country it\u2019s from.\u201d",
      "Schumer\u2019s request to Homeland Security came two days after New York Stewart International Airport was closed following multiple drone sightings nearby. The Democratic lawmaker told reporters it was \u201cremarkable\u201d that \u201cwe have more questions than answers\u201d amid a growing number of mysterious sightings.",
      "\u201cSome of the drones are small. Some of the drones\u2019 flight patterns are erratic,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cMultiple drones flying together can confuse a traditional radar system, and that\u2019s why, again, this new technology can really get us the answers that we need.\u201d",
      "Schumer said he was working to pass a bill that would give local law enforcement \u201cmore tools for drone detection.\u201d Currently, only federal agencies have the legal authority to scour for drones. The Democratic lawmaker\u2019s office did not immediately respond to an email Monday requesting more information.",
      "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, meanwhile, said on X late Sunday that he had met with state police officials and radar technicians who are \u201csurveying the area for unmanned aircraft systems.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe public deserves clear answers \u2014 we will keep pushing the federal government for more information and resources,\u201d Murphy said."

      "TikTok has challenged the law, saying it violates its free speech rights under the First Amendment.",
      "\"The Act will shutter one of America\u2019s most popular speech platforms the day before a presidential inauguration,\" TikTok's lawyers wrote in the court filing.",
      "\"This, in turn, will silence the speech of Applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts, and other matters of public concern,\" they added.",
      "TikTok asked the Supreme Court to act by Jan. 6.",
      "\"Today, TikTok is asking the court to do what it has traditionally done in free speech cases: apply the most rigorous scrutiny to speech bans and conclude that it violates the First Amendment,\" company spokesman Michael Hughes said in a statement.",
      "If the Supreme Court temporarily blocks the law, it would tee up a final decision from the justices on whether the law passes constitutional muster. The court could expedite consideration of the case, meaning it could issue a final ruling within months.",
      "If the justices reject TikTok's application, the law would go into effect as planned. TikTok could still seek to have the high court review the law while it is in place, but the justices would already have sent a signal that they think the company is unlikely to prevail.",
      "The federal government has defended the law on national security grounds, saying there are concerns about the Chinese government's influence over the app.",
      "TikTok, as well as eight individual users and Based Politics Inc., a conservative group that uses TikTok, all filed separate challenges saying the law violates their free speech rights, too.",
      "The individual challengers filed their own application at the Supreme Court. For people who rely on TikTok, the ban would be \"devastating to their livelihoods, their communities, and their ability to express themselves and hear the ideas of their choosing,\" their lawyers wrote.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the law, despite finding that it did implicate the First Amendment and needed to be reviewed very closely.",
      "Applying court precedent, the three-judge panel concluded that the law served a compelling government interest and was sufficiently narrowly tailored to further that interest.",
      "The appeals court found that the government's national security justifications, including concerns that the Chinese government could access data about American users and potentially manipulate content on the app, were legitimate.",
      "TikTok was launched in the U.S. in 2018 and has become increasingly popular, now claiming 170 million American users.",
      "Its algorithm provides users with streams of short-form video content that adjusts based on their interests.",
      "There were national security concerns from the beginning, with Trump at one point seeking to ban it. Trump has since equivocated, saying during the recent election that he could \"save TikTok.\"",
      "Trump said Monday he has a \"warm spot\" in his heart for TikTok when he was asked about the law. He was also scheduled to meet with TikTok's CEO, Shou Zi Chew, at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida on Monday, according to a source familiar with the meeting.",
      "The company has the backing of civil liberties groups that have joined the legal fight on free speech grounds."

      "Trump said During the wide-ranging news conference at his Mar-a-Lago property that one of the biggest differences over the last four years is that \"everybody was fighting me.\"",
      "\"The biggest difference is that people want to get along with me this time,\" he said.",
      "It was Trump's first news conference since he won the election and the first event he has hosted himself since November.",
      "Trump referred to recent meetings with Apple CEO Tim Cook, Alphabet and Google CEO Sundar Pichai and former Alphabet President Sergey Brin. He also said he plans to meet with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos this week.",
      "\"Tim Cook was here. I think he\u2019s done an incredible job at Apple. He talked about the future of Apple. It\u2019s going to be a bright future. But we have many others also, and not in that business,\" he said. \"We have a lot of great executives coming in, the top executives, the top bankers, they were calling.\"",
      "Several major tech companies, including Amazon, Meta and OpenAI, have already donated $1 million each to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "Trump has had a complicated history with many of Big Tech's CEOs as a number of them criticized policies enacted when he was last president \u2014 and banned him from social media platforms after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.",
      "In 2020, for example, executives lambasted Trump over his executive order to freeze new visas for foreign workers, arguing that immigrants have helped strengthen the U.S. economy and, specifically, technology companies.",
      "In the wake of Jan. 6, Trump was barred from using his Twitter and Facebook accounts. He sued Facebook, Twitter and Google over some of the bans.",
      "Trump had also feuded with Bezos over his ownership of The Washington Post, Amazon's decision not to do business with the far-right social media app Parler in 2021 and a bid Amazon made on a $10 billion Defense Department contract.",
      "The thawing of relations is emblematic of a broader rightward turn in the tech sphere, with some of its other leading figures now taking official and unofficial roles in Trump's second administration. Most prominent is Tesla CEO Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest person, whom Trump has named to lead a Department of Government Efficiency alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, a former biotech executive. Trump has also named venture capitalist David Sacks and technologist Jacob Helberg to business advisory roles.",

      "\"Yeah, I would, I think that he was treated pretty unfairly,\" Trump said, adding that he doesn't know the \"gravity\" of the case but that the allegations don't seem fair. \"I mean, I'd have to see it, because I don't know the facts.\"",
      "Of the reported sightings of drones over New Jersey and New York, Trump said, \"The government knows what is happening.\" He declined to say whether he had received an intelligence briefing about it.",
      "\"For some reason, they don't want to comment, and I think they'd be better off saying what it is our military knows and our president knows. And for some reason, they want to keep people in suspense.\"",
      "Trump commented on the suspected shooter in the death of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, Luigi Mangione, and the people who have praised him for committing the crime.",
      "\"It's really terrible that some people seem to admire him, like him,\" Trump said. \"It was cold-blooded, just a cold-blooded, horrible killing.\"",
      "Asked whether plans to stop a ban on TikTok next month, Trump said, \"We'll take a look at TikTok.\"",
      "\"You know, I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" he said, adding that he thought his electoral performance with young voters was in part due to his use of TikTok. \"I won youth by 34 points. And there are those that say that TikTok has something to do with that.\u201d Trump lost the majority of voters under 44, according to national exit polls.",
      "Trump also said he plans to sue The Des Moines Register over the newspaper's final poll of the election cycle reporting that Vice President Kamala Harris led by 3 percentage points. Trump wound up winning the traditionally red state by more than 13 percentage points.",
      "While the news conference was Trump\u2019s first since he won the election, he has attended other organizations\u2019 events, including a SpaceX test launch, and gone to numerous sporting events. During the same period in 2016, Trump had already held eight \u201cvictory rallies\u201d around the country and \u201cgaggled\u201d with media in the lobby of Trump Tower numerous times.

    "story": [
      "Fourteen Democratic senators will introduce an amendment Monday evening to remove language from Congress\u2019 massive defense spending bill that seeks to ban coverage of gender-affirming care for transgender children of service members, the office of Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., told NBC News.",
      "The 1,800-page National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, passed the House last week by a vote of 281-140, with 200 Republicans and 81 Democrats voting \u201cyes,\u201d and 124 Democrats and 16 Republicans voting \u201cno.\u201d The $895 billion bill authorizes the annual budget for the Defense Department and sets defense policies for the upcoming year.",
      "The group of 14 senators, led by Baldwin \u2014 who will be the Senate\u2019s sole LGBTQ member in the new term \u2014 is seeking to remove a provision tucked into the bill that would prohibit \u201cmedical treatment for military dependents under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria\u201d under the military\u2019s health care program, Tricare.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be clear: we\u2019re talking about parents who are in uniform serving our country who have earned the right to make the best decisions for their families. I trust our servicemembers and their doctors to make the best healthcare decisions for their kids, not politicians,\u201d Baldwin said in a statement. \u201cOur amendment would protect military families\u2019 right to make their own decisions and access sometimes lifesaving care for their children.\u201d",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., pushed publicly and behind the scenes for the provision to be added into the defense spending bill, which was negotiated by senior House and Senate leaders from both parties. In a statement following the House vote last week, Johnson said the legislation prioritizes \u201cmilitary lethality, not radical woke ideology. This legislation permanently bans transgender treatment for minors, prohibits critical race theory in military academies, ends the DEI bureaucracy, and combats antisemitism.\u201d",
      "If the amendment remains in the NDAA, it would mark one of the first times Congress passed a federal statute directed at trans people. President Joe Biden will either sign or veto the bill if it passes the Senate, which is scheduled to vote on it this week before leaving Washington for the rest of the year; the NDAA must pass before Jan. 1.",
      "A draft of a media release shared with NBC News \u2014 and scheduled to be made public Monday evening \u2014 from Baldwin\u2019s office said that if the transgender health care provision survives, it could affect 6,000 to 7,000 children of U.S. service members. Modern Military Association of America, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ members of the military and veterans, estimates that there are roughly 10,000 trans youths between 6 and 22 with parents who are active military.",
      "In recent weeks, Congress has repeatedly quarreled over the rights of transgender people, who make up just 0.5% of all Americans above age 18, according to the Williams Institute. With the election of Congress\u2019 first transgender member, Rep.-elect Sarah McBride, D- Del., House Republicans have introduced a measure to bar trans people from using bathrooms that align with their gender identities in the Capitol complex. Some Democrats have also been fighting with one another over whether the party\u2019s stance on trans rights played a role in Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 election loss.",
      "The amendment to remove the trans health provision from the defense bill will be co-sponsored by Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Cory Booker and Andy Kim of New Jersey, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Patty Murray of Washington, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Tina Smith of Minnesota, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, and Chris Murphy of Connecticut, according to a statement from Baldwin\u2019s office."

Rand Paul, R-Ky., a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which will also review his nomination.",

      "A key senator to watch in Kennedy\u2019s battle for confirmation is Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is stepping down from GOP leadership after 18 years in the top job but staying on as a senator, eliminating a political hurdle to voting as he pleases. McConnell, a polio survivor, fired a warning shot Friday in response to a New York Times report that a Kennedy adviser once asked the Food and Drug Administration to rescind approval of the polio vaccine.",
      "\u201cThe polio vaccine has saved millions of lives and held out the promise of eradicating a terrible disease,\u201d McConnell said in a statement.\u00a0\u201cEfforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous.\u201d",

Kennedy spokeswoman Katie Miller told NBC News on Friday, \u201cThe Polio Vaccine should be available to the public and thoroughly and properly studied.\u201d",
      "Asked Monday whether he supports the polio vaccine, Kennedy told reporters, \u201cYeah, I support it.\u201d",

      "\u201cObviously, HHS under the first Trump administration was very clear on the issue of abortion conscience protections and all those things.

He needed a 367 majority vote to win, but only 207 members of the Bundestag, or parliament, were willing to back him. A total of 394 lawmakers voted against him and 116 abstained.",
      "Scholz's fractious coalition fell apart last month after he fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a member of the pro-market\u00a0Free Democrats party, with which the SDP had formed a government, along with the environmentalist Green Party.",

      "It is only the sixth time that a no-confidence vote has been called in the country of 83 million people, Europe's most populous and the continent's largest economy.",
      "The confidence vote was needed because in post-World War II Germany, the constitution does not allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself.",

      "Seven foreign tourists\u00a0were hospitalized in Fiji in a suspected case of alcohol poisoning at a luxury resort, Fijian and Australian officials said Monday.",
      "The guests, who, according to local media, included an American, were hospitalized after they drank cocktails\u00a0at a bar at the five-star Warwick resort near the town of Sigatoka. The group also included four Australians and two unidentified foreign nationals.",
      "They were hospitalized with nausea, vomiting and neurological symptoms, The Associated Press reported, citing Fiji Health Ministry spokesperson Jemesa Tudravu.",
      "Two people remained stable in the hospital Monday, Tourism Minister Viliame R. Gavoka was quoted as saying by the AP, while five others have been discharged.",
      "The cause of the guests\u2019 illness was not immediately clear, and officials said it was too soon to say whether contaminated alcohol played a role.",
      "The case is similar to one in the Southeast Asian country of Laos last month in which six tourists, including an American and two Australian teenagers, died after they drank alcohol tainted with methanol.",
      "Gavoka said there were no other reports of similar illness at the resort or elsewhere in Fiji, a South Pacific archipelago nation that is home to about 930,000 people. He said the Warwick resort, which is on the Coral Coast of Fiji\u2019s largest island, Viti Levu, \u201cholds a strong reputation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests,\u201d Gavoka said, according to the AP.",
      "A spokesperson for the resort said it was taking the matter \u201cvery seriously\u201d and conducting a thorough investigation as it awaits test results from the authorities.",
      "\u201cAt this moment, we do not have conclusive details, but we are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our guests,\u201d the spokesperson, Savaira Molaucake, said in an email.",
      "Australian Treasurer Jim Chalmers told reporters in Canberra on Monday that four Australians had been hospitalized over the weekend and that Fiji police were investigating to determine the cause of their illnesses.",
      "\u201cWe are thinking of the friends and family of the people who are affected. This is no doubt a very distressing time for them,\u201d he said.",
      "David Sandoe, of Australia, whose daughter and granddaughter were among those affected, told Sky News Australia on Monday that they were headed back to Australia after having been cleared for release and that the hotel and Fiji police had been \u201cfantastic\u201d in keeping everyone informed.",
      "Australia has also updated its travel advisory for Fiji to warn about the risk of alcoholic drinks\u2019 being spiked or poisoned with methanol.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t leave your drinks unattended, pay attention when your drinks are being mixed and get urgent medical help if you suspect that something is wrong,\u201d Chalmers said."

    "story": [
      "Jay-Z\u2019s lawyer expects the hip-hop mogul, whose real name is Shawn Carter, to soon be \u201ccleared\u201d from a lawsuit that accuses him and rapper Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs of raping a minor in 2000, he told NBC News on Monday.",
      "Carter\u2019s lawyer, Alex Spiro, told NBC News in an on-camera interview his client \u201cisn\u2019t going to get shaken down\u201d after he was accused in a civil lawsuit last week of raping a 13-year-old girl at an MTV Video Music Awards after-party in New York more than two decades ago.",
      "\u201cThis case needs to be dismissed, and Mr. Carter\u2019s name needs to be fully cleared,\u201d Spiro said.",
      "For more on this story watch \u201cTop Story with Tom Llamas\u201d tonight at 7 p.m. ET/6 p.m. CT on NBC News Now.",
      "The anonymous accuser, identified only as \u201cJane Doe,\u201d alleged Carter removed her clothes, held her down and raped her while Combs and an unnamed female celebrity watched. She said Combs also raped her as Carter and the woman looked on.",
      "On Monday, Spiro distanced Carter from Combs, who faces federal criminal charges in New York of racketeering, sex trafficking and other offenses. Combs is behind bars at Brooklyn\u2019s Metropolitan Detention Center after he was denied bail for a third time last month. His trial is scheduled for May 5 and he has pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "\u201cThere is no friendship or longtime bond here,\u201d Spiro said. \u201cJust because they knew each other, know each other, that doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d",
      "Carter has called the allegations \u201cidiotic\u201d and fought the claims in a lengthy statement.",
      "\u201cThese allegations are so heinous in nature that I implore you to file a criminal complaint, not a civil one!!\u201d the rapper said, in part. \u201cWhomever would commit such a crime against a minor should be locked away, would you not agree? These alleged victims would deserve real justice if that were the case.\u201d",
      "Spiro, who has asked a judge to deny a request to remain anonymous from the accuser, praised Carter for standing \u201chis ground\u201d and said his team would \u201ccontinue to seek justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Carter speaks for himself, and he speaks from a position of strength because he\u2019s completely innocent and these claims are obviously false,\u201d Spiro said. \u201cBut it is upsetting. Nobody wants to hear these things.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe expect Mr. Carter to be cleared of this in the coming days,\u201d he added.",
      "The lawyer\u2019s remarks come after the accuser revealed some inconsistencies when she recounted the alleged attack from 24 years ago in an exclusive interview with NBC News.",
      "Among the inconsistencies: The woman said her father picked her up after the alleged sexual assault, but he said he doesn\u2019t recall that. The woman also claims she spoke to a celebrity at the after-party where she said she was sexually assaulted, but that celebrity said he was not in New York at that time. And images from that evening show Carter and Combs at a different location than the one the woman described, although their whereabouts for the entire evening are unclear.",
      "\u201cThis incident didn\u2019t happen,\u201d Carter told NBC News in another statement on Friday, \u201cand yet he filed it in court and doubled down in the press,\u201d he added, referring to one of the woman\u2019s attorneys, Texas-based Tony Buzbee. \u201cTrue Justice is coming. We fight FROM victory, not FOR victory. This was over before it began. This 1-800 lawyer doesn\u2019t realize it yet, but, soon.\u201d",
      "In response to Spiro\u2019s latest comments, Buzbee said he encourages Spiro \u201cto do what he thinks appropriate.\u201d",
      "He said the woman was referred to his firm by another law firm, which drafted the initial complaint. He said four people at his firm have interviewed her and \u201cchecked details.\u201d He also said his firm ran a background check on her and asked a \u201cseasoned investigator to vet some details she disclosed to us.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose results were consistent with what the client had told us,\u201d Buzbee said.",
      "On Friday, he said he is continuing to vet the accuser\u2019s claims.",
      "\u201cOur conduct has been beyond reproach and will continue to be,\u201d Buzbee said.",
      "Buzbee has filed several lawsuits in recent months \u2014 all have withheld their complainants\u2019 names \u2014 accusing Combs of assault and rape. This is the first suit in which he has named another high-profile defendant.",
      "The woman has acknowledged the inconsistencies and said she has \u201cmade some mistakes\u201d in recollections of that night in 2000. But she said she stands by her allegations overall. The inconsistencies in her account of the incident do not necessarily mean the allegations are false.",
      "\u201cYou should always fight for what happened to you,\u201d the woman, who is now 38, said. \u201cYou should always advocate for yourself and be a voice for yourself. You should never let what somebody else did ruin or run your life. I just hope I can give others the strength to come forward like I came forward.\u201d",
      "The woman said she was living in Rochester, New York, in 2000 and was driven to the VMAs by a friend to fulfill a \u201cbucket list\u201d goal.",
      "She did not have a ticket, and she approached various limousine drivers to try to gain access to the show or an after-party.",
      "One driver told her that he worked for Combs and that she \u201cfit what Diddy was looking for,\u201d according to the lawsuit. She said he invited her to a party after the show and told her to return to his car later in the evening after he transported Combs and others to the after-party.",
      "Later, the driver picked her up, the suit said, and after 20 minutes they arrived at a white house with a U-shaped driveway. She said she had to sign a document she believed was a nondisclosure agreement on arrival \u2014 and did not receive a copy \u2014 to enter the party, which the suit says was filled with celebrities and people doing marijuana and cocaine.",
      "She was offered a drink that made her feel \u201cwoozy, lightheaded and felt [like] she needed to lie down,\u201d the lawsuit says, and she went into a room to rest.",
      "Shortly afterward, the suit says, Combs and Carter entered the room with Combs saying, \u201cYou are ready to party!\u201d",
      "The suit says that she was able to resist being forced to perform oral sex on Combs by hitting him in the neck and that he \u201cstopped.\u201d",
      "After the alleged assault, the suit says, she \u201cgrabbed her clothes\u201d and left. She made her way to a gas station, where she called her father, it says.",
      "The accuser is seeking unspecified damages. The lawsuit is filed under New York\u2019s Victims of Gender-Motivated Violence Protection Act.",
      "The federal lawsuit was originally filed in October in the Southern District of New York, listing Combs as a defendant. It was refiled on Dec. 8 to include Carter.",
      "Spiro said Carter was \u201crespectfully seeking either dismissal of the allegations or disclosure of the Plaintiff\u2019s identity.\u201d",
      "In his statement, Carter said he and his wife would have to explain the allegations to their children. \u201cMy only heartbreak is for my family,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cYou have made a terrible error in judgement thinking that all \u2018celebrities\u2019 are the same,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not from your world. I\u2019m a young man who made it out of the project of Brooklyn. We don\u2019t play these types of games. We have very strict codes and honor. We protect children.\u201d",
      "In a statement, legal representatives for Combs called the suits \u201cshameless publicity stunts, designed to extract payments from celebrities who fear having lies spread about them, just as lies have been spread about Mr. Combs.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs his legal team has said before, Mr. Combs has full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process. In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr. Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone\u2014man or woman, adult or minor,\u201d the statement read."

      "She said they parked on the shoulder of the road near the grass as her husband went to get ropes out of the trunk to tow their friend\u2019s 2016 Hyundai Veloster that was stuck in the mud. White said she was chatting with the wife, whose car needed help.",

      "\u201cAnd when they finally let me see him, I just sat with him. I just kissed him. I just laid my head on his chest. I just had to do that for a last time, because that would be my last time to kiss him, to lay my head on his chest,\u201d cried White.",

      "He also decided to turn his collection into a book, and while researching the eagle\u2019s place in American history, he came to a realization.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve never had a national bird,\u201d Cook said.",
      "The turkey myth",
      "The omission came as a shock to the staff at the National Eagle Center, who thought the honor had already been bestowed on the bird that nests in the trees surrounding their headquarters. Minnesota has the second-largest nesting population of bald eagles in the country, trailing only Alaska.",
      "\u201cPreston Cook brought that up to us years ago, and it was like, \u2018Oh, come on, you\u2019re kidding me,\u2019\u201d said Scott Mehus, the education director at the National Eagle Center. \u201cI\u2019ve been talking in classes all of these years, telling [people] it\u2019s our nation\u2019s symbol and our national bird.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been wrong all these years and so has everybody else in the country,\u201d Mehus said.",
      "The bald eagle became the nation\u2019s most prominent bird when it was placed on the great seal shortly after the country\u2019s founding. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, who were originally tasked with the responsibility, were unable to agree to a seal to represent the country, so in 1782, Secretary of the Continental Congress Charles Thomson submitted a version with the bald eagle, which was approved later that year. The eagle-emblazoned seal was first used on a document authorizing George Washington to negotiate a prisoner-of-war exchange and has been a national symbol since.",
      "But not all of the Founding Fathers were fans of the eagle. Franklin famously wrote in a letter to his daughter that he wished the eagle had not been chosen as the representative for the United States, calling it \u201ca bird of bad moral character\u201d and adding, \u201cHe does not get his living honestly.\u201d",
      "Franklin went on to say in his letter that \u201cthe Turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird, and withal a true original Native of America.\u201d",
      "But it's a myth that Franklin led discussions about making the turkey the national bird; historians believe he was joking. \u201cHe never advocated for the turkey to be our great seal,\u201d Scott said, though he admitted Franklin made some negative comments about the eagle.",
      "The bill",
      "\u201cThis is one of those few laws that\u2019s going to make no difference,\u201d Cook jokes.",
      "The bill Cook himself initially wrote and sent to Congress has no money attached to it; it doesn\u2019t even assist in conservation efforts related to bald eagles. It simply slips a line into the U.S. code between the national tree and the guidelines for inaugural ceremonies that says, \u201cThe bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is the national bird.\u201d",
      "He sent the bill to the offices of Minnesota lawmakers in both chambers of Congress, and a bipartisan group of senators led by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., brought it to the floor to be passed unanimously in the upper chamber.",
      "\u201cThey are the ones that came to us and said it\u2019s not the national bird,\u201d Klobuchar said on the National Eagle Center and Cook. \u201cSo that was the impetus.\u201d",
      "It takes an act of Congress and the president's signature to designate any item with the \u201cnational\u201d title; the rose got the honor in 1986 and the oak tree in 2004.",
      "\u201cNo one has to change anything; it\u2019s just a correction. It is only a correction in history to make things right and makes things the way they should be,\u201d Cook said. \u201cIt was one of those little pieces of history that I felt should be taken care of, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "The blazer",
      "Cook doesn\u2019t literally wear his passion for eagles on his sleeve, but it\u2019s close. He wears a bow tie embroidered with an eagle and an eagle pin on his lapel, and eagles even fly on his red, white and blue suspenders.",
      "When you ask him what his most prized eagle possession is, he points to the buttons he received when he was drafted into the Army in the 1960s, which are now sewn onto the blue blazer he wears often.",
      "\u201cI was issued these buttons on my dress uniform that has the great seal. Two years later, I got out, snipped the buttons off my military uniform, and I\u2019ve been wearing them ever since,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are the first items in my collection, and that gave me a start on collecting eagles for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "He looks at tables covered with old magazine covers showing caricatures of eagles flying away with small children in their talons and admits he hasn\u2019t stopped gathering items, calling it \u201ca working collection.\u201d He cycles the items through exhibits for children and interested visitors to look at in the National Eagle Center, but jokes: \u201cDon\u2019t tell my wife that I\u2019m still collecting.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy wife has been very tolerant, and I appreciate her for that,\u201d he said. \u201cOccasionally, she will say, \u2018You have too many eagles.\u2019 Occasionally, she\u2019ll say that.\u201d",
      "But just like legislating, marriage is about compromise, and even Cook\u2019s household has its limits.",
      "\u201cShe says, \u2018You can put them wherever you want in the house, but you cannot put them in the bedroom,\u2019\u201d Cook said with a laugh. \u201cI said, \u2018OK, I can live with that one.\u2019\u201d"

    "summary": "The FBI has warned lawmakers in classified briefings that the Chinese Communist Party is crafting fake stories to portray them in a negative light because of their support for Taiwan.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The FBI has held classified briefings warning a handful of U.S. lawmakers that the Chinese Communist Party is working to create fake stories to portray them in a negative light because of their hawkish views of Beijing and support for Taiwan, two U.S. officials familiar with the briefings told NBC News.",
      "The U.S. officials, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the briefings, said that one of the false stories being concocted by the CCP, cited by FBI briefers, is that these lawmakers are espousing pro-Taiwan views because they were taking \u201cbribes\u201d from Taiwan.",
      "\u201cThe CCP is trying to undermine congressional support for Taiwan\u2019s democracy, to paint it as corrupt and not in the American public interest,\u201d one of the two U.S. officials told NBC News. \u201cIt will not work.\u201d",
      "The officials said the briefings occurred in the fall.",
      "A third source, a House lawmaker who specializes in national security matters, said they had been informed about the alleged CCP scheme but had not personally received a briefing.",
      "The FBI had no comment. The Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to an emailed request for comment about this story.",
      "The classified discussions were described as \u201cdefensive\u201d briefings, the U.S. officials said, meaning the alleged CCP scheme had not been carried out yet, but the FBI wanted to share critical information with the intended targets as a way to pre-empt the attacks.",
      "The FBI commonly provides defensive briefings to senior officials when the bureau learns they have been targeted by foreign intelligence operations.",
      "Tensions between Beijing and Washington have escalated in recent years, particularly over the future of the island of Taiwan, a self-ruling democracy and a critical U.S. ally in Asia that China claims as its territory.",
      "In 2022, then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., an outspoken critic of China\u2019s human rights violations, made an unannounced visit to Taiwan and was awarded the highest civilian honor by its president. She was the highest-ranking U.S. official to set foot in Taiwan since former Speaker Newt Gingrich did it in 1997, and the move infuriated officials in Beijing, which launched military exercises around Taiwan including live-fire drills.",
      "Other lawmakers have made similar trips to Taipei. In February, bipartisan members of the special House committee investigating the CCP traveled to Taiwan to congratulate Lai Ching-te, the pro-independence candidate who had been elected president just weeks earlier. And this past May, House Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul, R-Texas, led a bipartisan group of six lawmakers on an official congressional visit to Taiwan to meet with Lai.",
      "Several members of the House Intelligence Committee and select House committee on the CCP declined to comment when asked if they had received a classified briefing on the matter. Lawmakers are prohibited from speaking publicly about any such classified briefings.",
      "Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Mich., the chairman of the select House committee on the CCP, had no comment about any specific plot by the CCP, but said it was no secret Beijing has been targeting U.S. officials and other Americans.",
      "\u201cThe CCP will try to discredit our way of life, our freedoms and will use every means necessary,\u201d Moolenaar told NBC News. \u201cSo you know, whether it\u2019s hacking high-level officials\u2019 communications, we can expect all these things.\u201d",
      "Starting with the 2022 midterm elections, China has adopted increasingly sophisticated and aggressive tactics to try to aggravate political divisions in American society and undermine congressional candidates that Beijing deems hostile to the regime\u2019s interests, especially over the status of Taiwan, according to U.S. intelligence officials and researchers.",
      "In the 2024 presidential contest, China did not appear to favor either candidate but instead focused on specific downballot races with covert disinformation campaigns, using artificial intelligence tools and fake accounts mimicking Americans. The candidates targeted included McCaul; Rep. Barry Moore, R-Ala.; and Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., according to an analysis from Microsoft.\u00a0A Chinese Embassy spokesperson said at the time that the claims were \"full of malicious speculations\" and that China had \"no intention\" to and would \"not interfere in the U.S. election.\"",
      "U.S. intelligence officials and analysts say China\u2019s efforts to stoke polarization and undercut Americans\u2019 confidence in the democratic process are part of a long-term effort that includes global information operations designed to tarnish America\u2019s image abroad.",
      "China\u2019s disinformation efforts have coincided with what U.S. officials say is a concerted effort to steal intellectual property and U.S. military secrets through espionage and cyber hacks.",
      "Earlier this month, the White House said that a Chinese hacking campaign targeting the U.S. and other countries was more sweeping and serious than previously known. The CCP had spied on the texts and calls of U.S. citizens by hacking at least eight American telecommunications companies, according to a White House official.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington responded to that allegation in a statement this month: \u201cChina firmly opposes the US\u2019s smear attacks against China without any factual basis.\u201d"

      "\u201cIt is a journey and it is a constant struggle, at least for me,\u201d Kardashian explained.",
      "Some of the reality star's fans may be surprised to learn that she didn't set out to lose weight when she first started working out at a gym.",
      "\"My weight loss journey started because I was getting a divorce,\" said Kardashian, referring to her breakup with ex-husband Lamar Odom.",
      "And seeing something she told her therapist in confidence end up in the tabloids also inspired her fitness routine.",
      "\u201cSo I stopped going to therapy and started going to the gym. I needed a release, but I did not trust anybody else anymore. And the place that I felt the safest was the gym,\" she said, adding that she has since resumed therapy with another therapist.",
      "Kardashian called the resulting changes to her body a \u201cbyproduct\u201d of her workouts rather than their focus. \u201cI loved the way I felt. I loved testing myself and challenging myself,\u201d she said.",
      "How has Kardashian lost weight and how has her body transformation altered her mentality? Here's everything she's shared about her weight-loss journey in recent years.",
      "She stopped mindless eating",
      "For Kardashian, mindless eating is a habit she learned to control, and she details how in her book \u201cStrong Looks Better Naked.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was a mindless eater. I ate for comfort. I also ate out of boredom and habit. I ate when I was unhappy (which I\u2019m sure many of you can relate to),\u201d she wrote.",
      "\u201cI even ate chips because I love the crunchy sound they make. And I didn\u2019t give much thought to what I was eating, or what I was putting inside my body, except hummus, of course, which is one of my weaknesses.\u201d",

      "She believes in making lifestyle changes, not dieting",
      "Once upon a time, Kardashian would\u2019ve been tempted to try a crash diet to jumpstart her weight-loss journey. These days, she\u2019s more passionate about making sustainable changes to her lifestyle.",
      "\u201cI truly dislike when people report I\u2019ve lost a tremendous amount of weight in a short amount of time or when people claim I\u2019m doing these ridiculous diets,\u201d she shared on X in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s really setting the wrong tone. I believe in making lifestyle changes when it comes to my food.\u201d",
      "It's a sentiment Kardashian also echoed in her book when she advised her readers against dieting.",
      "\u201cWhen you diet, you are basically setting yourself up for failure. I mean, the word die is in there! You\u2019re not allowing yourself to enjoy the food you love, and it will only make you want it that much more. Make smart lifestyle changes, one baby step at a time,\u201d she wrote.",
      "She slowly ramped up her workout routine",
      "While embarking on any new fitness routine, it's important to ease in, and that's exactly what Kardashian did when she started exercising more regularly.",
      "\u201cWhen I first started working out, it was agony,\u201d she said during a Poosh livestream with her sister\u00a0Kourtney Kardashian Barker in 2020. \u201cWhen I was heavier and when I was more unhealthy, I had no idea what I was doing. I think I started two days a week for the first two weeks, and then I advanced to Monday, Wednesday, Friday.\u201d",
      "The reality star encouraged her fans to be patient with themselves along the way.",
      "\u201cI think everyone just thinks, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to work out and I\u2019m going to lose all this weight in two months,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work that way\u2026 It\u2019s going to be a long journey, but it\u2019s going to be the most rewarding journey.\u201d",
      "She mixes up her workouts",
      "From Pilates to SoulCycle and just about everything in between, Kardashian has dabbled in many workouts over the years. She previously told Harper\u2019s Bazaar she\u2019s a big fan of circuit training and \u201creally intense cardio.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a beast at the gym. I\u2019m super competitive and I\u2019m a sweater. I\u2019m like, \u2018Don\u2019t f--- with me and don\u2019t mess up my routine,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "In 2020, Kardashian revealed that she enjoys jumping rope for 30 minutes and using her treadmill. She also runs up and down hills using her daughter True as her \"weights.\"",
      "The Hydrow ambassador is also a fan of rowing machines.",
      "She started working with a nutritionist",
      "Once she got a handle on her fitness routine, Kardashian started seeing a nutritionist to better understand the dietary changes she should make to live a healthier lifestyle.",
      "In her book, the reality star recalls how a simple blood sample analysis revealed that she should avoid overloading on carbohydrates. She also sent her brother Robert Kardashian for the same test and he got similar results.",
      "\"It\u2019s not that we couldn\u2019t have carbs, but that we have to avoid them after\u00a0around four p.m. Apparently our bodies are not particularly good at breaking them down. And of course he told me to stay away from processed carbohydrates and stick to whole grains,\" she wrote.",
      "Next, Kardashian removed dairy from her diet, per her nutritionist's recommendation.",
      "\"But the moment I cut out dairy, limiting myself only to almond milk,\u00a0I felt transformed. Within a week I had more energy than I\u2019d had in months, and I was leaping out of bed in the morning, ready to seize the day,\" she wrote in her book, adding that she lost 13 pounds in less than three months by cutting out dairy (and continuing to exercise).",
      "No, she hasn\u2019t gotten weight-loss surgery",
      "Kardashian has tried many ways to lose weight, but surgery isn\u2019t one of them.",
      "\u201cOver the past three years, people are like, \u2018You must have gotten surgery because you just lost weight.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018It\u2019s been a 10-year journey! What are you talking about?\u2019 But even if people get surgery or (get on) the Ozempic craze, I\u2019m like, \u2018Who cares!\u2019 As long as people feel good about themselves, who am I to judge?\u201d she told Bustle.",
      "She believes everyone can find their ideal workout",
      "Kardashian\u2019s life transformed when she started prioritizing fitness, and she believes everyone can benefit from creating their own unique exercise routine.",
      "\u201cI also believe that working out is so incredibly healthy and should be done to each (individual's) own rhythm of life. There\u2019s no one size fits all when (it comes to) health and fitness,\u201d she wrote on X in 2018.",
      "She works out for her mental health",
      "Kardashian likes to compare the mental clarity she gets from her gym workouts to writing negative thoughts down in a journal.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re having a bad day, you get that anger out (at the gym),\u201d she told Bustle.",
      "Though she feels better mentally and physically since making this lifestyle change, Kardashian said her body confidence was better before.",
      "\u201cLooking back, when I was bigger, I thought I was the hottest thing in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI had so much more confidence the bigger I was, which is what\u2019s crazy. And then the more in shape I am, the more insecure I can get because I\u2019m so hard on myself. It\u2019s a vicious cycle that you don\u2019t get out of.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut when I started losing weight, I got the same thing. I was fat-shamed every day when I was bigger, and then when I lost weight, people were like,\u00a0'How dare you,\u00a0you are so insecure,\u00a0you\u2019re following society,'\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, you guys are so confusing!\u2019 I realized you\u2019ll never make everyone happy. I have to do what\u2019s best for me.\"",
      "She doesn\u2019t focus on the number on the scale",
      "Kardashian knows that obsessing over the number on the scale isn\u2019t a healthy way to live your life.",
      "\u201cI never thought about the number,\u201d she told Harper\u2019s Bazaar while discussing her weight-loss journey in 2016. \u201cWhen I started seeing that I could lose weight\u2014because I just thought my body would never change\u2014I started taking it more seriously and eating better.\u201d",
      "She's realistic about pregnancy weight gain",
      "There's no one-size-fits-all approach to losing weight after giving birth. In 2019, Kardashian opened up about her 40-pound weight gain while she was pregnant with her daughter True, who was born in 2018. She also shares son Tatum, 2, with her former partner Tristan Thompson.",
      "\u201cI was\u00a0203 pounds when I delivered, which blows my mind,\u201d she told her mom Kris Jenner during a clip from her show \u201cRevenge Body with Khloe Kardashian.\u201d \u201cYou think you\u2019re going to have a baby and all of it\u2019s going to come out, and then you leave the hospital and you\u2019re like, \u2018What is going on? Why do I still have all of this weight?\u2019\u201d",
      "She likes working out with a partner",
      "It\u2019s no secret that a workout buddy can help you take your gym sessions to the next level. Kardashian previously told Harper\u2019s Bazaar she enjoys working up a sweat with her sister Kourtney Kardashian Barker.",
      "\u201cI love that we can work out together. Because Kim sort of prances and is super cute and gorge, while Kourtney and I are dripping wet,\u201d she said in 2016."

    "title": "35 years after 'When Harry Met Sally,' can men and women just be friends?",
    "published": "Sun, 15 Dec 2024 14:30:00 GMT",
    "summary": "For the 35-year anniversary of \"When Harry Met Sally,\" we revisited the key question at the heart of the film: Can men and women just be friends?",
    "story": [
      "Thirty-five years ago, the world was introduced to Harry Burns and Sally Albright, two bumbling New Yorkers who fall in and out of each other's lives before finding love 12 years after meeting.",
      "\"When Harry Met Sally...\" has since given pop culture memorable lines like \"I'll have what she's having,\" fashion touchstones like Harry's sweater and trends like \"Meg Ryan fall.\"",
      "Billy Crystal reflected on the film's endurance on Sunday TODAY, saying \"there\u2019s so much truth and love in that movie.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s so much romance in that movie. There\u2019s so much confusion in that movie about relationships that that\u2019s an eternal situation for people,\" he told Willie Geist for the Dec. 15 edition of \"Sunday Sitdown.\" \"And young kids now, they\u2019re into the phase of their life where they may be falling in love and, 'Is this the right thing?' It took Harry and Sally 12 years to figure it out, you know?\"",
      "The film's tagline notably posed a philosophical, even existential, question: \"Can two friends sleep together and still love each other in the morning?\"",
      "The question is explored both in the story's plot and its dialogue. After meeting via a carpool from the University of Chicago to New York City, Harry and Sally bump into each other over the years before striking up a friendship. Whether or not their relationship can stay platonic becomes the driving force of the film.",
      "Harry argues, in one of their earliest run-ins, that men and women can't just be friends \"because the sex part always gets in the way.\" And at the risk of spoiling the 35-year-old film, he's seemingly proven right by the end.",
      "After Sally hears that her ex-boyfriend is getting married, she tearfully calls Harry. When he comes over to console her, the pair sleep together for the first time and find themselves on vastly different pages the next morning: Harry wants to go back to being friends, and Sally tries to end their friendship forever.",
      "In the movie's finale, Harry sprints in the snow to profess his love to Sally at a New Year's Eve party, a scene that some on X have recently said \"literally changed the trajectory\" of their lives.",
      "The movie's screenwriter, Nora Ephron, who died in 2012, said that the film wasn't about answering the question, \"Can men and women be friends?\" Instead, the movie is about the differences in how men and women view friendship, she wrote in the introduction to a 1990 printing of the script, per Entertainment Weekly.",
      "\u201cThe truth is that men don\u2019t want to be friends with women. Men know they don\u2019t understand women, and they don\u2019t much care. They want women as lovers, as wives, as mothers, but they\u2019re really not interested in them as friends. They have friends,\" she said.",
      "\"Women, on the other hand, are dying to be friends with men. Women know they don\u2019t understand men, and it bothers them: they think that if only they could be friends with them, they would understand them,\" she added.",
      "But how would that question be answered now?",
      "We asked some of the most popular authors today for their take on the core question at the heart of the film: Can men and women just be friends? Or, updated for 2024, can two people who are attracted to each other just be friends?",
      "Here's what they said.",
      "Emily Henry",
      "Emily Henry is the author of several romance novels, including \"People We Meet On Vacation,\" which she's described as an homage to \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" and \"Book Lovers,\" featuring a main character named Nora Stephens, after Ephron.",
      "\"People We Meet on Vacation,\" currently being adapted for a film starring Emily Bader and Tom Blyth, follows Poppy and Alex and their friendship from college to adulthood, sustained through annual vacations.",
      "On the question of whether two people attracted to each other can just be friends, Henry says, \"I actually do think so.\"",
      "\"I think Poppy and Alex could have stayed friends, they just had to make the decision,\" she says. \"You can't be half-in and half-out, you have to make the decision and really commit to it.",
      "\"For a lot of us, attraction comes and goes, but friendship is forever,\" she adds. \"I wonder what Nora would actually say because the movie, it's like they get together, but was she really saying they can't (be friends), or was she just saying these people belong to each other? I wish I could ask her.\"",
      "Yulin Kuang",
      "Speaking of the \"People We Meet on Vacation\" film adaptation, the screenplay for that project was written by Yulin Kuang. She's also set to direct the adaptation of Henry's \"Beach Read,\" and in April she published her debut romance novel, \"How to End a Love Story.\"",
      "Kuang says she's a huge \"When Harry Met Sally...\" fan.",
      "\"I have never lived in a world without it, which feels correct,\" she says.",
      "In fact, the writer had the \"When Harry Met Sally...\" screenplay printed out and kept it on her desk, \"so I could absorb its energy by osmosis.\"",
      "Looking back on it now, she gives a clear answer on the film's question.",
      "\"Can men and women be friends? Yes,\" she says. \"Can two people who are attracted to each other \u2014 that one gives me pause.\"",
      "\"Yes, but if I was very attracted to (a friend), I would have to do some unpacking about that in therapy,\" she adds. \"If it was getting to the point of, 'We're in crush territory,' I think that would be a little dangerous.\"",
      "As to how the film answers its own question, Kuang described it as a \"specific story,\" rather than a generalization. Because both characters feel relatable, like real people pulled from the world, it's understandable to view the movie as a commentary on men and women, she says.",
      "\"But ultimately, it's really just a commentary on Harry and Sally,\" she says.",
      "Kennedy Ryan",
      "Kennedy Ryan is the author of more than 20 books, including \"Reel\" and the upcoming conclusion to her \"Skyland\" series, \"Can't Get Enough.\"",
      "Ryan says \"When Harry Met Sally...\" is an example of \"nailing the happily ever after\" with the New Year's Eve love confession and kiss.",
      "\"That's like, hall of fame happily ever after,\" she says.",
      "Like Henry and Kuang, she thinks people who are attracted to each other can stay friends \u2014 but \"it can be complicated.\"",
      "\"I say that just because I have several friends who are guys who I've known for years,\" she says. \"Now, I also have had friends who were guys who, it didn't work out that way, where you thought that it would be fine being platonic, and then one catches feelings for the other, and then it gets complicated, and you can get really hurt and lose friendships that way.\"",
      "She maintains it's possible with specific boundaries.",
      "\"I think it just comes down to being clear about what you both want and when things shift, being honest about that,\" she says.",
      "It also depends on if you find them attractive, or, if you're attracted to them.",
      "\"If you are attracted to someone, and I say this as a romance novelist \u2014 like, I live by this stuff \u2014 it's the draw, it's the pull, and that's something that, if it's strong enough, it's hard to ignore,\" she says. \"But also, if you are attracted to someone, you have to ask, why is this not a romantic relationship? And when you interrogate that, maybe it helps you deal with the attraction.\"",
      "Tia Williams",
      "Tia Williams is the author of the romance novel \"Seven Days In June\" and 2024's \"A Love Song for Ricki Wilde.\"",
      "Williams calls \"When Harry Met Sally...\" a comfort movie.",
      "She says she remembers seeing \"When Harry Met Sally...\" in theaters when she was 13 and was struck by the film's central question.",
      "\"Back then, friendship was \u2014 everything was defined in very restrictive terms and put in these very traditional buckets,\" she says. \"If you're friends, that's platonic. It means you're not having sex, and you never will.",
      "\"But I think that the idea of friendship has evolved. I mean, when we get to 'Sex and the City,' we have the idea of f--- buddies, and people that you aren't pursuing a relationship with that you're really just friends with, that you're also having sex with,\" she adds.",
      "She describes the film's essential question as, \"Can you platonically be friends with someone that you are attracted to?\"",
      "\"No, I don't think you can,\" she says. \"I don't think there's any way to be platonic friends with someone that you desperately want to have sex with.\"",
      "She argues if one is attracted to a friend, the dynamic can no longer be described as platonic.",
      "While having the friendship between Harry and Sally inevitably turn into a relationship may seem \"puritanical\" \u2014 \"if you're attracted, you have to be lovers\" \u2014 Williams argues the film's depiction of romance  defied gender normative roles of men and women not understanding each other.",
      "\"It's showing there's friendship within a relationship,\" she says. \"In 'When Harry Met Sally...' they were actually friends for years, and then fell in love. Women are people. Men are people. We can have friendship, respect.\"",
      "But, \"they were never going to be just friends,\" she adds.",
      "Emma Straub",
      "Emma Straub is the author of the novels \"Modern Lovers,\" \"The Vacationers,\" \"This Time Tomorrow\" and more.",
      "Straub, who grew up on Manhattan's Upper West Side, describes \"When Harry Met Sally...\" as a \"tour of my childhood.\"",
      "\"I would love for every rom-com to be this smart and funny and let its characters read books. Harry is often reading books in this movie and that is meaningful to me. And they just have smart conversations,\" she says.",
      "She says \"of course\" men and women can be friends, and so can two people who are attracted to each other.",
      "\"I think if the circumstances had been different their friendship would have continued for the rest of their lives, quite happily,\" she says. \"I feel like it's a very boring answer, but I think yes.\"",
      "\"I feel like I have a lot of male friends, and so I believe that of course it's possible, even with someone as absolutely charming as Billy Crystal,\" she adds. \"I think I could absolutely just be friends with Billy Crystal.\"",
      "And while the film ends with Harry and Sally in a romantic relationship, she argues the film \"does actually prove that men and women can be friends \u2014 I'm willing to say it,\" she says.",
      "\"What I believe to be true is that romance is really about timing,\" she says. \"That's what you see in the movie. There are all of these misses in terms of timing for them, and then the timing is right. But it doesn't mean in the multiverse, in the Harry and Sally multiverse, that it always would be.\"",
      "Jasmine Guillory",
      "Jasmine Guillory, whose next book, \"Flirting Lessons,\" comes out in April 2025, is the author of nine romance books, including \"The Wedding Date.\"",
      "Guillory says \"absolutely\" people who are attracted to each other can be friends, because attraction isn't the only determining factor of whether or not a relationship can work.",
      "\"I'm attracted to so many people who I recognize that our relationship is perfect as it is, and I would never want to do anything to it,\" Guillory says.",
      "The film also shows that a person can be attracted to someone, but not meant for them \u2014 or at least, that version of them.",
      "\"Yes, (Harry and Sally) are meant for each other. But at the beginning of the movie, they aren't. And I think that happens in life, right?\" she says.",
      "\"There are people who you may have known 10 years ago who, if you had had a relationship then, it would be terrible, but now it's perfect,\" she says."

    "published": "Sat, 14 Dec 2024 19:41:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Selena Gomez's engagement ring might be sparking a trend into marquise cut diamond rings. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "It seems like Selena Gomez won't be \"Single Soon,\" now that she's engaged to Benny Blanco.",
      "While announcing their engagement on social media Dec. 11, Gomez posted a close-up of her ring. The main diamond takes center stage, but the chunky yellow gold band also sparkles with smaller stones.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw the ring, all I could think about was how unique it was,\u201d jewelry content creator and gemstone wholesaler Julia Hackman Chaf\u00e9 told TODAY.com in an email statement.",
      "At first, Chaf\u00e9 was surprised by the ring choice. She expected Gomez to \u201cgo for a colored stone ring\u201d since Blanco, whose real name is Benjamin Levin, \u201cspecifically wears a lot of colored gemstones.\u201d Blanco wore a necklace with a large red stone during his May 2024 TODAY with Hoda & Jenna appearance, for example.",
      "Instead, she went for a marquise cut diamond. Chaf\u00e9 estimated Gomez\u2019s center stone is four carats with .25 carat stones lining the band. \u201cThe diamond itself, if Benny chose a high-quality diamond, is probably around $75,000 and up,\u201d she said.",
      "But it appears the marquise cut has a deeper, and deliberate, meaning. The diamond type is referenced in Gomez's 2015 collab with A$AP Rocky, \u201cGood for You,\u201d when she sings, \u201cI\u2019m in my marquise diamonds/ I\u2019m a marquise diamond/ Could even make that Tiffany jealous.\u201d",
      "The gist of the lyrics is about wanting to look good for someone else. \"Let me show you how proud I am to be yours,\" Gomez sings.",
      "Chaf\u00e9, like many internet commentators, is convinced the choice of ring stems from the song. \u201cIt must be something from there,\u201d she said.",
      "On Dec. 14, Blanco added new evidence to the theory by posting a video of him and Gomez clinking glasses after their engagement. Gomez shows off her new ring in the clip, and Blanco set the video to \"Good for You,\" specifically highlighting her lyric about marquise diamonds.",
      "Among diamonds, a marquise is one of the \"less popular cuts,\" Chaf\u00e9 said.",
      "\"But with the rise in popularity of all things elongated, it was a matter of time before marquise came into fashion,\u201d she added.",
      "Some marquise cut-wearers are happy Gomez joined the club. A TikToker posted a video with the text, \"Now me and Selena have the same Marquise Diamond ring.\"",
      "Others are anticipating that Gomez's ring will spark a spike in popularity, making their unique rings not quite as special. One TikToker posted a video of her marquise ring with the text \"to my marquise girlies... it was nice while it lasted.\"",
      "Going forward, Chaf\u00e9 also expects the marquise cut to rise in popularity.",
      "\u201cAnything Selena Gomez does will spark a trend. Perhaps not in 2025, but in 2026, for sure, marquise will be a popular cut,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "A new movie about the life of Mary, the mother of Jesus Christ, is sparking debate among viewers and religious scholars alike.",
      "\u201cMary,\u201d a Biblical epic streaming now on Netflix, tells the story of the Nativity through the eyes of Mary of Nazareth (Noa Cohen). The film follows Mary, Joseph (Ido Tako) and the newborn Jesus as they escape persecution from King Herod (Anthony Hopkins).",
      "\u201cMary is the most extraordinary woman ever to walk this earth, yet her story remains largely unknown beyond a few passages in the Bible,\u201d director D.J. Caruso told Netflix\u2019s Tudum blog.",
      "\u201cI embarked on this journey \u2014 to create a film that presents her in her most human and relatable form,\u201d he continued, adding that his aim was \u201cto portray Mary as someone we can all connect with, not just as a saint but as the young woman we all recognize before her sanctification.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe said her intention was to make Mary and Joseph\u2019s story \u201crelatable,\u201d speaking to\u00a0The Christian Post, and tell a story of a \u201cyoung girl becoming a woman in the midst of such divine expectations.\u201d",
      "While some viewers are praising the film, which has been in Netflix\u2019s Top 10 for much of the time since its debut on the streaming platform Dec. 6, others have objected to what they views as the movie\u2019s Biblical and historical inaccuracies. Others have objected to the casting.",
      "What religious scholars are saying about \u2018Mary\u2019",
      "Religious scholars have had mixed reactions to \u201cMary,\u201d as they debate perceived inaccuracies in the portrayal.",
      "Christy Cobb, a assistant professor of Christianity in the department of religious studies at the University of Denver, says the field of Biblical studies has been alight with discussions about the film. She first heard about \u201cMary\u201d through a post on Facebook \u2014 \u201ca rant post,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cBiblical scholars are hearing about these movies, and then we get excited, and then when we watch it, we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this isn\u2019t depicting Biblical stories as accurately or historical moments as accurately as we hope that they would be,\u2019\u201d she says.",
      "There\u2019s \u201cvery little\u201d about Mary in the Bible, Cobb says. Aspects of Mary\u2019s character in the movie are based on passages of the New Testament (the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke) and an early Christian text called the Proto Gospel of James.",
      "Filmmakers took creative liberties with Mary's depiction, Cobb says. Cobb appreciated that the film's Mary is more \u201cfiery and rebellious\u201d than commonly depicted. \u201cI like that we\u2019re depicting Mary as this full character with some agency, courage and her fears at the surface,\u201d she says.",
      "But other historical inaccuracies stood out.",
      "The movie places modern conservative family values onto the Holy Family in a way that is \u201cnot supported by the text\u201d or by historical context, Cobb, who is working on a book about early Christian families, says.",
      "\u201cThe Holy Family was depicted (in the movie) as a nuclear family. Joseph is immediately supportive of Mary and will protect Mary at all costs,\u201d she says.",
      "The Bible, however, says that Joseph wanted to divorce Mary. Families also \u201clooked quite different\u201d in that era than they do today, Cobb says. Divorces were common and there would have been more people living in the household than depicted in \u201cMary.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the Bible, all sorts of families are represented, not just one view of a family system,\u201d she says.",
      "The result, Cobb says, is \u201cwe\u2019re having the the debate about what a Christian family (should) look like, superimposed upon this film.\u201d",
      "Producer Mary Aloe, speaking to Christian Post, said that script approval came from \u201ca range of religious leaders\u201d to \u201censure authenticity.\u201d",
      "However, only one person, Adam W. Schindler, is listed as a Biblical consultant on IMDB. Schindler is a pastor and the chief digital officer of the conservative nonprofit think tank America First Policy Institute, founded by two former advisors to president Donald Trump. The movie is funded, in part, by megachurch pastor Joel Osteen, per IMDB.",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Aloe Entertainment, Schindler and Caruso for comment about script consultants.",
      "Other aspects of the movie \u2014 including Mary\u2019s more down-to-earth characterization \u2014 are sparking debate for straying from doctrine.",
      "Some Catholic commentators have objected to the depiction of Mary\u2019s labor pains during the birth of Jesus, because showing Mary suffering during childbirth \u201cdoes not comport with Catholic teaching,\u201d Joseph Pronechen wrote in a review for the National Catholic Register.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Fathers and doctors of the Church, including Sts. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, have taught that Mary alone would be exempt from such pains as a sign of her unique holiness,\u201d he sayss in his review. \u201cShe alone had no original sin.\u201d",
      "Caruso addressed his choice to show Mary in pain during labor in a recent interview with Christianity Today.",
      "\u201cRegarding the labor pains: That\u2019s about presenting Mary in a human way, acknowledging that she had apprehensions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think something like a third of women died in childbirth in antiquity.\u201d",
      "Nathanael Andrade, a chair and professor of history at Binghamton University, who has written a forthcoming book about the crucifixion of Jesus, also pointed out a \u201cserious problem\u201d for movies like \u201cMary\u201d and others that portray the life of Jesus.",

      "Why the casting of Mary also stirred up controversy",
      "\u201cMary\u201d ruffled feathers outside of the religious community. Some people have objected to the casting of Noa Cohen, a Jewish Israeli actor, as Mary. Several other actors in the movie, including Ido Tako, who plays Joseph, and Keren Tzur, who plays Elizabeth, are also Israeli.",
      "The real Mary was believed to be a Jewish woman from Nazareth, Galilee. At the time of Mary\u2019s birth, Galilee was a region in ancient Palestine. Today, it is located in northern Israel.",
      "Online, some viewers believe Mary should have been portrayed by an Arab Palestinian actor in the new movie, pointing to modern conflicts in the region. Others defended the casting of a Jewish actor to play Mary.",
      "Caruso spoke to the casting decision in an interview with Entertainment Weekly. \u201c It was important to us that Mary, along with most of our primary cast, be selected from Israel to ensure authenticity,\u201d he said.",
      "Speaking to Netflix\u2019s press site Tudum, Caruso said it was his \u201cgoal\u201d to find an actor \u201cfrom the region where Mary was born to play her.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like if we could find a great young Jewish actress, that would be amazing,\u201d he told Netflix\u2019s Tudum.",
      "\u201cI just know that Noa did an amazing job. She\u2019s a fantastic actress. She\u2019s got this grace and beauty, and at the same time, she\u2019s accessible. I\u2019m so proud of her performance, and I think it should be celebrated. It has nothing to do with politics,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe idea of the movie is to spread love, and art is hopefully a uniter,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not supposed to be something that separates anybody.\u201d"

      "While the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d winner was initially unsure about trying medication to lose weight, she said she decided to \u201cbecause my blood work got so bad.\"",
      "\u201cMy doctor chased me for like two years, and I was like, \u2018No I\u2019m afraid of it, I already have thyroid problems,\u2019\u201d she explained.",

      "She added that she didn\u2019t notice how much weight she\u2019d gained prior to starting the medication. But catching a glimpse of herself on camera one day prompted her to pause and ask herself \u201cWho the f--k is that?\u201d she recalled.",
      "\"My heaviest, I was like 203, and I\u2019m 5 foot 3 and a half,\" Clarkson continued. \"It\u2019s funny because people assume, \u2018Oh she must\u2019ve been miserable, depressed, whatever,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018No I was not.'\"",
      "\u201cI was never insecure about it, I was happy,\u201d she added.",
      "After sharing that she was using a weight-loss medication, Clarkson faced a wave of backlash which Goldberg addressed on an episode of \"The View.\"",
      "Clarkson was on the receiving end of criticism from those who said she'd previously claimed she lost weight by walking. \"Here's a point about that,\" Goldberg said. \"A lot of people are taking this shot because the need it. Some people need (their) bodies jumpstarted, some have diabetes, there's lots of reasons. She has been walking, but this has helped.\"",
      "Goldberg went on to point out the hypocrisy of the comments. \"They kick her behind when she's bigger, they kick her behind when she's lost the weight, and now they're kicking her behind because she said it out loud.\"",
      "How did Kelly Clarkson lose weight?",
      "In addition to taking a weight-loss drug, Clarkson has made lifestyle changes for her long-term health.",

      "She did not address her gym routine but said, \u201cWalking in the city is quite the workout.\"",
      "Clarkson chose to relocate her talk show to New York from Los Angeles in 2023. \u201cI was very unhappy in L.A. and had been for several years. I needed a fresh start,\u201d Clarkson told People. California, she said, wasn't good for her mental health.",
      "In New York, she adopted a few other wellness trends, too. \"I\u2019m really into infrared saunas right now. And I just got a cold plunge because everybody wore me down,\" the \"Piece By Piece\" singer added.",
      "As for her diet, Clarkson isn't doing anything extreme.",
      "\u201cI eat a healthy mix,\u201d she told People. \u201cI dropped weight because I\u2019ve been listening to my doctor \u2014\u00a0a couple (of) years I didn\u2019t. And 90% of the time I\u2019m really good at it because a protein diet is good for me anyway. I\u2019m a Texas girl, so I like meat \u2014\u00a0sorry, vegetarians in the world!\"",
      "\u201cBut I still splurge. The other night I had a frozen yogurt with my daughter, and it was magical,\" added the Grammy winner, who shares daughter River Rose, 10, and son Remington, 8, with ex-husband Brandon Blackstock.",
      "Kelly Clarkson's thyroid and other health issues",
      "Clarkson has spoken before about her thyroid and autoimmune issues and trying to lose weight to address them.",
      "For example, she changed her diet and ended up losing about 37 pounds,\u00a0she told TODAY\u2019s Hoda Kotb in 2018.",
      "\u201cI know the industry loves the weight gone, but for me, it wasn\u2019t really the weight,\u201d Clarkson said at the time.",
      "Back then, to lose the weight, Clarkson focused on a lectin-free diet, she told Extra. Lectins are the proteins that bind carbohydrates. (Talk to a health professional before making any major changes to your diet, such as removing carbs.)",
      "Clarkson read a book about lectins and cut them out of her diet which meant no legumes, beans, whole grains, dairy and certain veggies.",
      "\"I literally read this book, and I did it for this autoimmune disease that I had and I had a thyroid issue, and now all my levels are back up,\" she said during the interview. \"Literally, I haven\u2019t worked out at all.\"",
      "During a January 2024 episode of her talk show, she revealed\u00a0she was prediabetic.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t shocked,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cI was a tiny bit overweight. ... They were like, \u2018You\u2019re prediabetic. You\u2019re right on the borderline.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018But I\u2019m not there yet.\u2019\u201d",
      "Two years after finding out, she decided to change her lifestyle habits.",
      "Having\u00a0prediabetes\u00a0means your blood sugar levels are higher than normal but still lower than the range for Type 2 diabetes, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. Exercise and a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of it progressing.",

      "Throughout her years in Hollywood, the \"American Idol\" star has had to deal with a lot of commentary about her size.",
      "She told Glamour UK in 2020 that being thin doesn't always give her more confidence, adding that she got her coaching role on \"The Voice\" after gaining some weight.",
      "\u201cI got on the No. 1 television show at my heaviest point, because it was right after I had kids, and it was like they didn\u2019t care,\u201d Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cPaul (Telegdy, chairman of NBC Entertainment) hired me from NBC because he loved my personality, he loved that I connect with people and I\u2019m really raw and real. It had nothing to do with my sex appeal or my look aesthetically. It had to do with me as a person. I think it\u2019s really up to artists to force people to have that mentality.\u201d",
      "Clarkson and TODAY's Jenna Bush Hager bonded over weight struggles when Jenna and her twin sister, Barbara Pierce Bush, appeared on \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\" in November 2023.",
      "During the conversation, Clarkson showed a photo of Jenna and Barbara dressed identically as kids.",

    "story": [
      "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz lost a vote of no confidence Monday, paving the way for early elections in February and ending a turbulent year at the polls for several of Europe's leaders and governing parties.",
      "Scholz called Monday's vote with the expectation of losing it, but with the hope that it would boost the fortunes of his center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP). He needed a 367 majority vote to win, but only 207 members of the Bundestag, or parliament, were willing to back him. A total of 394 lawmakers voted against him and 116 abstained.",
      "Scholz's fractious coalition fell apart last month after he fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner, a member of the pro-market\u00a0Free Democrats party, with which the SDP had formed a government, along with the environmentalist Green Party.",
      "Scholz accused Lindner of violating his trust at the time after Lindner publicly backed a different economic policy than the one they had agreed upon. The chancellor subsequently announced he'd call for a no-confidence vote.",
      "President Frank-Walter Steinmeier now has 21 days to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election, and he is expected to do so after Christmas. New elections will then have to be held within 60 days of his decision.",
      "It is only the sixth time that a no-confidence vote has been called in the country of 83 million people, Europe's most populous and the continent's largest economy.",
      "The confidence vote was needed because in post-World War II Germany, the constitution does not allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself.",
      "If Steinmeier allows the dissolution of parliament, something he is likely to rubber-stamp given his largely ceremonial role, a vote will take place just nine months before parliamentary elections had been scheduled.",
      "Scholz called the confidence vote after weeks of infighting with his coalition partners on a 2025 budget and Germany's future economic policy prior to Lindner's firing.",
      "Kallum Pickering, chief economist at Peel Hunt, a leading British investment bank, told CNBC that Germany's leaders are likely going to find agreement on fiscal policy regardless of the new election results.",
      "\"Even if within say the first three to six months of the new administration you don\u2019t get changes to the debt brake, if they have a big enough majority, eventually I think economic conditions will just force them to accept the reality that they need a fiscal stimulus,\" Pickering said.",
      "While the Christian Democratic Union,\u00a0led by Friedrich Merz, is ahead in the polls, according to Reuters, the far-right Alternative for\u00a0Germany\u00a0(AfD) could also help to shape the new government.",
      "Fresh from September's success in regional elections in Thuringia, when it became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War II, the party is also polling well at a national level.",
      "However, it is unlikely the group would be able to govern because other parties have refused to align themselves with the far right, despite Germany\u2019s parliamentary system traditionally producing coalitions.",

      "Oren Marmorstein, a spokesperson for Israel\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry, confirmed to NBC News on Sunday that Israel had filed the appeal against the ICC warrants.",
      "The warrants were related to \u201ccrimes against humanity and war crimes committed from at least 8 October, 2023 until at least 20 May 2024,\u201d including \u201cthe war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has not responded to a summons for questioning over his failed attempt to declare martial law.",
      "Yoon had been asked to appear for questioning Sunday as part of an investigation by the prosecutors\u2019 office, but he said he was still forming his legal defense team, the prosecutors\u2019 office told reporters. Prosecutors planned to issue another summons Monday.",
      "Yoon, who faces criminal investigation on possible rebellion charges, was impeached Saturday by a vote of 204 to 85. His presidential powers were immediately suspended, with Prime Minister Han Duck-soo serving as acting president.",
      "Yoon gave a defiant speech after his impeachment, touting his achievements since he entered office in 2022, including the establishment of a trilateral security partnership with the U.S. and Japan, South Korea\u2019s historic rival.",
      "\u201cI will not give up. I will do my best for our country,\u201d Yoon said.",
      "If Yoon continues to defy requests for questioning in the two inquiries, investigators could ask a court to issue a warrant for his arrest.",
      "A separate team of investigators from the police, the defense ministry and an anti-corruption agency failed Monday to deliver Yoon a summons to appear for questioning Wednesday, which is his 64th birthday, according to an official from the newly formed Joint Investigation Headquarters.",
      "The presidential security service refused to accept the request document, saying that it was not its \u201cextent of services remit,\u201d the official told reporters.",
      "\u201cBut we also issued the attendance notice via mail. There will be no problem in relaying the notice,\u201d he added.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court on Monday began reviewing Yoon\u2019s impeachment over the short-lived martial law order, which stunned the East Asian democracy and key U.S. ally.",
      "Yoon has apologized for declaring martial law but argued the opposition-controlled parliament gave him no choice by paralyzing the government. Within hours of his Dec. 3 announcement of the order, which banned all political activity and censored the news media, Yoon rescinded it after lawmakers voted unanimously to reject it.",
      "His party remains internally divided over his impeachment, which many members opposed. Party leader Han Dong-hoon, who urged lawmakers to vote for the second impeachment motion, said Monday that he was stepping down.",
      "Yoon\u2019s impeachment trial is set to begin Dec. 27, Constitutional Court spokesperson Lee Jin told reporters Monday, and the court has six months to decide whether he should be removed from office. If Yoon is removed or resigns, a presidential by-election will be held within 60 days.",
      "Yoon is South Korea\u2019s second conservative president in a row to be impeached after Park Geun-hye in 2016.",
      "Allies spooked",
      "The political instability in South Korea, which has led to the resignations or arrests of multiple senior defense and military officials, had spooked markets, as well as the U.S. and other allies, amid concerns that nuclear-armed North Korea, which technically remains at war with the South, might try to take advantage of the situation.",
      "Those concerns appear to be easing after Yoon\u2019s impeachment. South Korean markets ended Monday mixed, CNBC reported, with the blue-chip\u00a0Kospi\u00a0losing 0.22%, while the benchmark Kosdaq ended the day 0.69% higher.",
      "Han Duck-soo, the acting president, told President Joe Biden by phone Sunday that South Korea \u201cwill be carrying out its foreign and security policies without fail.\u201d",

      "According to the White House readout, Biden \u201cexpressed his appreciation for the resiliency of democracy and the rule of law in South Korea\u201d and reaffirmed the \u201cironclad\u201d nature of the U.S. alliance with South Korea, which hosts nearly 30,000 American troops.",
      "In North Korea, where state media did not report on Yoon\u2019s martial law declaration until a week after it happened, the state-run news agency KCNA reported Monday on Yoon\u2019s impeachment, as well as the large crowd of protesters who gathered outside the National Assembly in Seoul in support of Saturday\u2019s impeachment vote.",
      "That crowd was estimated at 200,000, Yonhap reported, citing the police, while there were smaller rallies in support of Yoon.",

      "On Sunday, Lee called for a swift impeachment trial and said his party would cooperate in efforts to restore stability.",
      "He said he would not seek the impeachment of Han, the acting president, over his alleged role in the martial law declaration, \u201cbecause too much impeachment would result in confusion.\u201d",

      "The cause of the guests\u2019 illness was not immediately clear, and officials said it was too soon to say whether contaminated alcohol played a role.",
      "The case is similar to one in the Southeast Asian country of Laos last month in which six tourists, including an American and two Australian teenagers, died after they drank alcohol tainted with methanol.",
      "Gavoka said there were no other reports of similar illness at the resort or elsewhere in Fiji, a South Pacific archipelago nation that is home to about 930,000 people. He said the Warwick resort, which is on the Coral Coast of Fiji\u2019s largest island, Viti Levu, \u201cholds a strong reputation.\u201d",

      "A woman was arrested in Iran after she posted a video of herself singing without a hijab on YouTube, even though the Iranian parliament passed a new, stricter law on women's modesty that rights groups have criticized.",
      "Parastoo Ahmadi posted a 27-minute video of her concert performance Wednesday, in which she sang in a sleeveless dress with her hair down accompanied by four male musicians. In the caption, she described it as an \"imaginary concert\" and invited the audience to \"imagine this beautiful homeland\" in Iran.",
      "The performance was recorded in a caravanserai, the name for the roadside inns historically built along the Silk Road to provide merchants and travelers with places to rest as they trekked the ancient trade route spanning North Africa to Central Asia. Ahmadi wrote that it was \"where history and our myths intertwine.\"",
      "\"I am Parastoo, a girl who wants to sing for the people I love,\" the caption said. \"This is a right I could not ignore; singing for the land I love passionately.\"",
      "Milad Panahipour, an Iranian lawyer, told The Associated Press that Ahmadi was arrested Saturday over the performance. He said he was unaware of the charges, the arresting agency or the location of her detention.",
      "Iran's judiciary confirmed that a case has been opened into Ahmadi's performance but did not specify the charges. The statement, released by the state-run Mehr News Agency, also said Ahmadi was released after an interview with authorities.",
      "\"The Mazandaran Police Information Center announced that Ms. Parastoo Ahmadi attended a briefing session after posting a video deemed contrary to cultural norms and values,\" the agency said. \"She has been asked to appear before judicial authorities.\"",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norway-based organization, said it got a report that two of the men performing with her \u2014 Sohail Faghih-Nassiri and Ehsan Beyraghdar \u2014 were also arrested.",

      "The hard-line regimes that have reigned since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution have passed laws saying women must be veiled in the presence of men, though women have resisted the rules both domestically and abroad.",
      "Conflict over the issue drew international outrage once again in 2022 when a young woman named Mahsa Amini, 22, was arrested outside a subway station in Tehran and accused of failing to properly wear a hijab. She was dead just three days later.",
      "Iran's government denied wrongdoing, claiming that Amini died of pre-existing medical conditions. Human rights groups, however, have cast doubt on that, and a United Nations fact-finding mission\u00a0asserted she was killed \u201cas a result of beatings\u201d by Iranian authorities.",
      "Her death drew rage throughout Iran, drawing women out to protest in droves despite violent crackdowns by authorities.",
      "The authorities who enforce the modesty laws, often called the morality police, have eased public confrontations with women over veiling since President Masoud Pezeshkian was elected this year. Pezeshkian campaigned as a reformist who opposed such types of morality police patrols.",
      "But enforcement has not stopped altogether, according to locals who have said the police are now instructed to issue warnings rather than take immediate action. So-called anti-unveiling clinics have also been established, where women are encouraged to follow the hijab laws through \"therapy.\"",
      "Despite Pezeshkian's reformist approach, the parliament pushed even harsher laws about women's veiling this year.",
      "The Hijab and Chastity Law was originally submitted by former President Ebrahim\u00a0Raisi, who died in May, and it was ultimately passed in September, according to Human Rights Watch. Enforcement will go into effect for a three-year trial period, which the rights organization said will dramatically increase the punishments for women who do not comply.",
      "The new law extends the enforcement into online spaces, increases fines for violations depending on frequency, institutes a travel ban for offenders and includes long-term imprisonment as punishment, Human Rights Watch reported. Fines alone could be detrimental for many Iranians as the country's economy has struggled under the weight of years of sanctions and regional conflict.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Council's experts on Friday called for the law to be repealed, describing it as a \"comprehensive system of gender-based persecution.\"",
      "Pezeshkian himself criticized the law this month as difficult to enforce in both a statement on X and an interview on state television.",
      "\u201cWe should not do anything that disrupts the unity and solidarity of society,\u201d Pezeshkian said. \u201cWe need to have dialogue and engage in discussions about this issue.\u201d"

      "Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Saturday that the U.S. has made direct contact with Syria\u2019s Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (HTS) rebels as they transition from a militant insurgency toward a more legitimate governing authority.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been in contact with HTS and with other parties,\u201d Blinken said after talks in Aqaba, Jordan, with diplomats and representatives from several Arab nations.",
      "The U.S. designates HTS a terrorist organization, making it legally impossible to work with the group, but contact underscores ongoing efforts to change that designation as the U.S. and its allies look to support Syria's transition from Bashar al-Assad's rule.",
      "In a joint statement after the meeting, the governments of the U.S. and Turkey, the E.U., and Arab countries called for \u201ca more hopeful, secure and peaceful future\u201d in Syria, stressing respect for women and minorities and preventing \u201cthe reemergence of all terrorist groups.\u201d",
      "The statement stressed that \"the transitional political process must be Syrian-led and Syrian-owned [and] produce an inclusive, non-sectarian and representative government.\"",
      "No representatives from Syria were at the meeting.",
      "The talks reflect cautious optimism over HTS\u2019 evolving role in governing Syria, with early signs of efforts to establish stability after 13 years of civil war, and within the nation's many factions.",
      "Front of mind for Washington is the return of American journalist Austin Tice, who disappeared in Syria over a decade ago. Blinken said in Jordan that he had emphasized the importance of finding Tice in talks with Syria's new parties.",
      "Tice is thought to have been taken captive near Damascus in August 2012 while he was covering the country\u2019s civil war. But while thousands of prisoners were released when HTS took control of Damascus, Tice\u2019s whereabouts remain unknown.",
      "Obaida Al-Arnaot, an official spokesperson, said Syria\u2019s interim government had tried to find Tice, who is 43, to reunite him with his family but had so far had no luck. President Joe Biden told reporters last week that efforts to pinpoint his location in Syria were ongoing.",
      "In another sign of the shifting dynamics, Turkey announced Sunday that it has reopened its embassy in Damascus after 12 years, while schools and universities have also resumed operations in areas formerly controlled by Assad.",
      "Turkish Defense Minister Ya\u015far G\u00fcler\u00a0has said his country is ready to offer military training to Syria \"if the new administration requests it.\u201d",
      "In comments authorized for publication Sunday and translated by Reuters, G\u00fcler said Turkey saw no signs of a complete Russian withdrawal after satellite images appeared to show Russian forces packing up and dismantling military equipment at one of their key bases in Syria.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the Russians are going to leave,\" he said. \"They\u2019ll do everything they can to stay.\u201d",
      "As the transition continues, there is concern for Syria\u2019s minority groups. Kurdish communities, in particular, have expressed wariness about HTS, given the group\u2019s past association with Al Qaeda and the uncertain future of ethnic and religious minorities under its control.",
      "In a message to the Kurds, HTS leader Ahmed Al-Sharaa, formerly known by the nom de guerre, Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, sought to ease fears with a statement Saturday, stating that Kurds are \u201cpart of the homeland\u201d and that \u201cthere will be no injustice\u201d against them.",
      "\u201cThe coming Syria will have the Kurds as its foundations, and we will live together in it, and everyone will take their rights,\u201d he said.",
      "The message is part of HTS\u2019 ongoing efforts to project a more moderate image and distance itself from its Al Qaeda past, even as the U.S. continues to view the group as a terrorist organization. In 2018, the U.S. placed a $10 million bounty on Al-Sharaa's head.",
      "Israel remains deeply concerned about extremists' gaining power in neighboring Syria, and it carried out multiple airstrikes on Syrian weapons depots and air defenses overnight into Sunday, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.",
      "The attack appears to be the latest in a series of airstrikes that Israel says are aimed at preventing Assad\u2019s arsenal from falling into the hands of militants.",
      "But U.S. engagement with HTS may signal a potential shift in Washington's approach, sparking hopes that it may eventually remove the strict sanctions, which it has imposed on the country for decades and intensified at the start of the civil war in 2011.",
      "\u201cWe can hopefully see a quick end to the sanctions so that we can see, really, a rallying around building of Syria,\u201d United Nations envoy Geir Pedersen told reporters during a visit to Damascus to meet the new interim government.",
      "Biden has already outlined continued U.S. involvement in Syria, without commenting on whether Washington would remove or reconsider the designation.",
      "\u201cWe will engage with all Syrian groups, including within the process led by the United Nations, to establish a transition away from the Assad regime, toward independent, sovereign and independent,\u201d he said last week. \u201cSyria with a new constitution, new government that serves all Syrians.\u201d"

      "\u201cYes, he is older than her, but he will treat her well and won\u2019t make her cook. The man just wants to get married,\u201d Batta said she heard him say, before he added, \u201cShe will marry whether you accept or not.\u201d",
      "Batta said she \u201chad just turned 11 when my father asked me to take a shower and wear nice clothes.\u201d Afterward, she said, he took her to a gathering of a group of men, including a cleric. \u201cI later learned that one of them was the man who would be my husband, while the other two were witnesses to the marriage,\u201d she said.",
      "Later, she said, she learned that her father had received 15 million Iraqi dinars, or around $11,300, from the man, part of which he used to buy a new taxi. \u201cI also learned that my husband was 47 years old,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cOn the first night, the night I lost my virginity, I didn\u2019t know what this man was doing. I felt immense pain, and I cried as he knelt over me without being able to move my hands or feet,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to forget this day, even though I will never forget it.\u201d",
      "Nonetheless, Batta said, her husband \u201ctreated me well\u201d for the first year of their marriage, but after a year \u201chis behavior towards me changed.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe started hitting me for anything I did, even if I was just watching television; he would hit me and say that I had no right to watch TV,\u201d she said, adding that \u201ceven servants were treated better than I was.\u201d",
      "When her father died of cirrhosis two years after their wedding, she said, her husband would not allow her to attend the funeral.",
      "Batta said that in July 2016, when she was just 14, he took her to the cleric who married them. Afterward, she said, he took her back to her family home and told her mother, \u201cThis is your daughter, and this is her divorce paper.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy mother never let me leave the house because she felt ashamed of what the neighbors would think,\u201d she said. \u201cEven my siblings didn\u2019t treat me well. I became like a servant in the house, having to serve everyone.\u201d",
      "At 16, she said, she decided to run away from home and go to Baghdad. There, she said, she met a woman on social media who offered her a place to stay \u201conly to find out that she ran a brothel.\u201d",
      "\u201cI work for her now,\u201d she said. \u201cI go with the other girls to one of the nightclubs, dancing in front of everyone and seducing men to get as much money as I can from them.\u201d",
      "At the end of each month, she said, the woman \u201cdistributes a quarter of the total amount we managed to obtain over the entire month, while the rest is considered rent and food money.\u201d",
      "\u2018Blatant violation of children\u2019s rights\u2019",
      "Batta is by far not the only child in Iraq to have been married at a young age.",
      "UNICEF reported in April 2023 that 28% of girls are married before the legal age of 18, although under Iraqi law, girls as young as 15 can be married with the consent of judges and their parents.",
      "The potential consequences of child marriage were laid bare in a 2016 report by the United Nations Population Fund on the effects of child marriage in Iraq\u2019s northern Kurdistan region, which said it \u201cusually comes with unhealthy and ill-informed sexual relations that may include unwanted and forced sex, domestic rape, vulnerability to domestic violence and genderbased violence and adultery.\u201d",
      "That ultimately affects \u201cthe physical and mental well-being of child spouses,\u201d the report said.",
      "But lawmakers, predominantly from the Shia Muslim bloc, including the political parties Hikma, State of Law and Hukok, are nonetheless championing amendments to the Personal Status Law, also known as Law 188, suggesting they are in line with both Iraq\u2019s Constitution and Islamic law. Iraq is predominantly Shia; around 40% of the population is Sunni Muslim.",
      "Adopted in 1959, the current law unifies all segments of society under a single code while enshrining the rights of women and children. As well as setting the age of marriage, it addressed child custody, inheritances and alimony payments focused on the welfare of both children and women.",
      "The law \u201cwas one of the most progressive in the Middle East,\u201d according to Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow at the London-based Chatham House think tank. It had survived \u201cregime changes, wars, civil wars and conflicts throughout many, many decades,\u201d he said.",
      "The newly proposed amendments would take a large amount of decision-making power away from both families and the courts and place it into the hands of clerics, some of whom set the age of puberty at 9.",
      "As a result, some lawmakers and rights groups are concerned that that would pave the way for legalizing and expanding child marriage in the country.",
      "The parties proposing the changes \u201ccame in promising democracy and a better future for Iraqis,\u201d Mansour said. But they failed to keep these promises, leading to increasing \u201cdisillusionment across the public\u201d and widespread protests calling for better services, increased job opportunities and an end to corruption, he said.",
      "\u201cThe ways in which they tried to gain legitimacy have waned,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so this is an attempt by some of them to reassert that they are indeed religious parties and their legitimacy is based around religion.\u201d",
      "Three lawmakers who supported the proposed changes declined to be interviewed.",
      "Some of those pushing for the changes have suggested that they could help lower divorce rates and boost family values.",
      "Speaking to Iraqi broadcaster Al-Forat News in September, lawmaker Dunya Al-Shammari said they would protect \u201cwomen and families from disintegration, and resorting to Islamic law is the best guarantor to preserve these rights.\u201d She added that it would help to \u201cachieve justice between men and women regarding child custody.\u201d",
      "Others, like fellow Shia lawmaker Alya Nassif, called for the proposals to be voted down, as similar amendments were in 2014 and 2017. Calling the proposals \u201cdangerous,\u201d Nassif said the law \u201cthreatens society and families.\u201d She said members of parliament had been presented with \u201ca collection of ideas written on two sheets of paper,\u201d rather than \u201clegal articles that are needed to be discussed for voting.\u201d",
      "Calling the proposed amendments a \u201cblatant violation of children\u2019s rights,\u201d Kurdo Omar, an MP who represents the Kurdistan Alliance, said she thought it would harm Iraq\u2019s \u201creputation both domestically and internationally.\u201d",
      "Both joined a lawmaker boycott of a second reading of the draft bill in early September, which prevented it from taking place, and both hope to scupper the amendments entirely.",
      "Batta hopes they succeed.",
      "\u201cChanging the law will lead many underage girls to face circumstances similar to what I went through,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI am sure that those who are trying to change the law do not allow their daughters to marry at a young age because they do not need the money. The issue is solely about money and nothing else.\u201d"

      "DAMASCUS, Syria \u2014 It had been less than two days since the fall of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime when two Islamist fighters knocked on the door of the Rev. Rafaat Abul Nasser\u2019s Lady of Damascus Church, armed with assault rifles, pious beards and probing questions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I was not afraid,\u201d Nasser told NBC News on Wednesday. \u201cBecause St. Paul says to be strong in the Lord.\u201d",
      "The soldiers strolled through the ornate sanctuary, snapped photos of the icons and asked about the meaning of the cross and the crucifix. Then they left. And that, Nasser said, was mercifully that.",
      "But the chilling visit is emblematic of the uneasy optimism that pervades this new Syria, where many are wondering whether the new regime will practice the inclusiveness and liberalism it preaches.",
      "Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, which led the charge on Damascus, was once closely linked with both Al Qaeda and the Islamic State, as were its leaders, and the U.S. and much of Europe still classify it as a terrorist organization.",
      "But the group disavowed its allegiances with the more extreme jihadist groups years before it actually conquered Damascus, taking the capital with little resistance and ending almost 14 years of civil war.",
      "\u201cPrecisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria,\u201d Mohammad al-Bashir, the newly installed transitional prime minister, told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera in an interview.",
      "The group\u2019s leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, appears to have changed his clothes as well as his mind, sporting a trimmer beard, simple military uniforms and even sometimes business suits.",
      "He has also retired his nom de guerre, \u201cAbu Mohammad al-Jolani,\u201d and guaranteed rights for women, minority groups and supporters of the old regime.",
      "But anxiety around the new leadership remains, and while some rights groups have acknowledged HTS\u2019 positive language, they have also highlighted the group\u2019s poor human rights record in regions it has governed in recent years, particularly in Idlib province in Syria\u2019s northwest.",
      "In a report last year on human rights practices in Syria, the U.S. State Department said HTS had \u201creportedly permitted confessions obtained through torture and executed or forcibly disappeared perceived opponents and their families.\u201d",
      "HTS held detainees \u201cincommunicado in secret detention facilities referred to as \u2018security prisons,\u2019\u201d it added, citing another study by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry for Syria.",
      "Its rise is particularly vexing for Syria\u2019s religious minorities, who were often pitted against one another during the ironfisted rule of Assad and the years of civil war.",
      "While about three-quarters of Syrians are HTS\u2019 Sunni Muslim co-religionists, the rest of the population is a kaleidoscope of Shiite Muslims and the Alawite minority sect, of which Assad was a member, which theologians consider an offshoot of that branch of Islam.",
      "Christians and the Druze, a small Middle Eastern sect that derives its beliefs from Islam while placing heavy emphasis on philosophy and spiritual purity, are much of the rest of the population.",
      "Last week, the road from Damascus to Lebanon was clogged with thousands of Syrians fleeing in the opposite direction, apparently uninterested in waiting to test the new regime\u2019s purported tolerance.",
      "\u201cThose who took over the government, their thoughts are terrorists\u2019\u201d thoughts, said Ammar Shahbander, 32, a Shiite philosophy professor from Aleppo who was waiting to cross the border with his wife and two small children. \u201cMaybe there will be a civil war. I have children. So of course I fear for them.\u201d",
      "Shahbander said he wasn\u2019t uniquely afraid of HTS and its leader. After nearly 14 years of nightmarish civil war fought by ordinary citizens, he said, his main concern is about the Syrian civilian population that is now addled by sectarianism, vengeance and easily accessible weapons.",
      "\u201cHTS maybe can control all these elements,\u201d he said. \u201cToday there is individual behavior. Maybe they will kill me or kill anyone. Can Jolani control this behavior?\u201d",
      "Jolani and his appointed prime minister, al-Bashir, have also said that welcoming Syrian refugees from abroad is among their top priorities. But despite their positive liberal signaling, some Syrians abroad are reluctant to return to a Syria that is not only destroyed but also dominated by fundamentalists.",
      "Abdulwahed Danou, an Arabic instructor from Aleppo, said over text message last week that his asylum application in the Netherlands was put on hold after Assad was ousted. Several European governments have already announced plans to send Syrian refugees back.",
      "\u201cI am totally lost. My head is spinning,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI would not like to be ruled by jihadists or extremists.\u201d",
      "Even when HTS\u2019 rank and file make all the right noises, their appearance and behavior betray a profound conservatism. At a traffic circle near Nasser\u2019s church, a cluster of camouflage-clad fighters lounged on manicured grass.",
      "They spoke freely about their fight for freedom as well-wishers crossed the busy intersection to congratulate them and offer them snacks. One of the young militiamen insisted that Syria\u2019s minorities had nothing to fear under the new regime.",
      "\u201cI will stay in my path, the path of jihad,\u201d Khatab Shawi, 21, one of the soldiers, said when he was asked what he planned to do after the revolution. \u201cOr I will go to our brothers in Gaza, and we will be martyrs for the sake of God. Hopefully after this war we will go to Gaza.\u201d"
