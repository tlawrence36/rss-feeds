      "Harvey Weinstein\u2019s lawyers are seeking to raise doubts about a former model\u2019s allegation that he repeatedly sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein 's lawyers sought Friday to raise doubts about a former model's allegations that he repeatedly sexually assaulted her when she was a teenager.",
      "As defense lawyer Mike Cibella began what's likely to be lengthy questioning of Kaja Sokola, he pointed to differences in some details of her testimony this week and what she told a grand jury last year.",
      "Cibella also noted that although documents have indicated that Weinstein and Sokola knew each other by 2006, no witnesses or documents corroborate her account of meeting the then-influential movie producer four years earlier at a Manhattan nightclub. She was 16 at the time and alleges he first sexually assaulted her days after they met.",
      "Sokola is the second of three accusers to testify at Weinstein's rape and sexual assault retrial, and she's the only one who wasn\u2019t part of the onetime Hollywood honcho\u2019s first trial in 2020.",
      "Weinstein is being retried because an appeals court overturned his landmark #MeToo 2020 conviction, saying the judge at the time allowed prejudicial testimony. After the reversal, prosecutors added Sokola\u2019s allegation to the case.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies ever sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, is a psychotherapist who had a jet-setting modeling career as a teen. She testified earlier this week that Weinstein exploited her youthful interest in an acting career to subject her to unwanted sexual advances, starting days after they met in 2002, while she was on a modeling trip to New York.",
      "Another alleged incident, in 2006, is the basis for a criminal sex act charge against Weinstein. Sokola, who was 19 at the time, says he lured her to a hotel room by saying he had a script for her to see, then pinned her down on a bed and performed oral sex on her as she implored him not to.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who allege they have been sexually assaulted, but Haley, Mann and Sokola have given their permission to be identified.",

      "Historian Ron Chernow\u2019s latest work may surprise readers who know him best for the book which inspired the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and for his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses Grant",
      "NEW YORK -- Historian Ron Chernow's latest work may surprise readers who know him best for the book which inspired the musical \u201cHamilton\u201d and for his biographies of George Washington and Ulysses Grant.",
      "The 1,200-page \u201cMark Twain\u201d will be published next week. It's Chernow's first release since his Grant biography came out in 2017, and the first time he has taken on a literary writer after a career defined by celebrated books about business leaders (John D. Rockefeller, the Morgan dynasty), presidents (Grant and Washington) and, most of all, Alexander Hamilton. His many honors include the Pulitzer Prize for \u201cWashington: A Life,\u201d the National Book Award for \u201cThe House of Morgan\u201d and the National Book Critics Circle prize for \u201cTitan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller, Sr.\u201d",
      "But a book on Twain had been in his thoughts for decades, dating back to when he saw Hal Holbrook play him on stage in Philadelphia in the mid-1970s.",
      "\u201cAnd there he was, with the white suit and cigar and mustache and he was tossing out one hilarious line after another,\u201d the 76-year-old Chernow says, remembering such Twain quips as \u201cThere's no distinctly Native American criminal class, except Congress.\u201d Chernow became fascinated by Twain as a prototype of the modern celebrity and found himself drawn less to \u201cMark Twain the novelist than the pundit, the personality and the platform artist.\u201d",
      "Chernow admittedly is more comfortable with the researchable world of facts than with the more intangible qualities of the imagination. But he found much to identify with Twain, relating to him as a fellow widower (Twain outlived his wife, Olivia, by six years; Chernow's wife, Valerie Stearn, died in 2006), as a public speaker and as an author fortunate enough to write full time.",
      "Chernow also looks closely into subjects familiar to him \u2014 politics and finance, notably the various failed business ventures that left Twain short of money despite his author royalties and the inherited wealth of his wife. Toward the end of the book, the historian addresses the friendships an elderly Twain cultivated with teen and preteen girls, whom Twain called his \u201cangelfish.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the time Twain\u2019s behavior was regarded as the charming eccentricity of a beloved humorist with a soft spot for children. We look at that same behavior today and find it odd and disturbing. It's important to get both perspectives,\u201d Chernow says. \u201cTwain\u2019s behavior was chaste and none of the angelfish or their parents ever accused him of improper or predatory behavior. At the same time, there was such an obsessive quality about Twain\u2019s attention to these teenage girls \u2014 he devoted more time to them than to his own daughters.\u201d",
      "During a recent interview at his Upper West Side Manhattan apartment, where his glass of Diet Coke stood on a coaster illustrated with a sketch of Twain receiving an honorary college degree, Chernow also reflected on Twain's family, his politics and the sadness in his soul. Chernow's comments have been condensed for clarity and brevity.",
      "\u201cI really don\u2019t know what he would say about Donald Trump. I could, yes, but I don\u2019t want to guess. But we do know what he said about political figures of his own day. And he hated Teddy Roosevelt. He saw that Teddy Roosevelt had a very large ego, very self-absorbed and a Mr. Bombastic personality. But he (Twain) has a wonderful quote where he says that Teddy Roosevelt is the Tom Sawyer of the political world of the early 20th century. He said that he was always hunting for attention. And then he has this great line. He said that in his (Roosevelt's) frenzied imagination, the great republic is one vast Barnum\u2019s circus, and he is the clown, and the whole world is his audience.\u201d",
      "To actually read about the children of famous personalities is almost invariably sad, as it often is with Mark Twain. The one who suffered from this most acutely, I think was the middle daughter, Clara, who was kind of insanely competitive with her father and felt overshadowed by him, wanted to kind of trade on his reputation, but then didn\u2019t want him to get the attention. She said that she would be in a room with her father, and she felt she was only Mark Twain\u2019s daughter, that she was reduced to the level of a footstool. And she also had a very interesting line, one that has a very contemporary ring: He would come into the room and he would flood the room with talk.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere's that time when he goes to the Sandwich Islands and he meets the American diplomat Anson Burlingame, who advises him to \u201ccultivate your betters,\u201d which Twain really takes to heart. I think that with Twain, if someone asks me, you know, did he marry Olivia for her money? I would say definitely not. It was a true love match. And as Twain said late in life, there was not a single day of his marriage that she didn\u2019t say, \u2018I worship you,\u2019 \u2018I idolize you.\u2019 This was just kind of pouring out of her and her letters. On the other hand, the more you know about Mark Twain, the more you know that he could never have married a poor woman.",
      "\u201cAnd the irony of Twain\u2019s life is that he spends his entire life attacking the plutocrats on the one hand, and on the other, he\u2019s doing everything in his power to become one. This man embodies in his person every tendency of the time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a tremendous amount of self-loathing in him. I have a quote later in the book \u2014 he says that (poet Lord) Byron detested life because he detested himself. Twain said, \u2018I\u2019m the same way.\u2019 You know, that's a really harsh, harsh thing to say. But I think that he saw all these impulses within himself that he was really powerless to stop. And then he realized he hurt other people. I think that Mark Twain did fit the stereotype of the funny man who\u2019s sad and depressed under the surface and is kind of releasing that through the humor.\u201d",

      "CANNES, France -- CANNES, France (AP) \u2014 Robert De Niro will receive an honorary Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, a culmination for the 81-year-old actor whose history with the French film festival stretches back half a century.",
      "In 1976, De Niro starred in two films \u2014 Martin Scorsese's \u201cTaxi Driver\u201d and Bernardo Bertolucci's \u201c1900\" \u2014 that premiered in competition at Cannes. \u201cTaxi Driver\" was an immediate sensation, and went home with the festival's top prize, the Palme d'Or.",
      "Since then, De Niro has been a regular on the Croisette, returning with \u201cThe King of Comedy\u201d in 1983, Sergio Leone's \u201cOnce Upon a Time in America\u201d in 1984 and Roland Joff\u00e9's \u201cThe Mission\u201d in 1986. Joff\u00e9's film also won the Palme, making De Niro the rare actor to star in two Palme d'Or winners.",
      "Though De Niro helps run his own film festival back in New York, the Tribeca Festival, he has remained a mainstay in Cannes. He presided over the jury in 2011 that selected Terrence Malick's \u201cThe Tree of Life\u201d for the Palme. Most recently, he and Scorsese returned to premiere \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon\u201d in 2023.",
      "\u201cI have such close feelings for Festival de Cannes,\" De Niro said when his honorary Palme d'Or was announced last month. \u201cEspecially now when there\u2019s so much in the world pulling us apart, Cannes brings us together \u2014 storytellers, filmmakers, fans, and friends. It\u2019s like coming home.\u201d",
      "De Niro is to receive the award in the festival's opening ceremony on May 13.",

      "The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs has been postponed until early next week",
      "NEW YORK -- The final stage of jury selection for the racketeering and sex trafficking trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was postponed until early next week, right before opening arguments begin, a federal judge decided on Friday.",
      "Prosecutors allege that Combs, 55, used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024. He pleaded not guilty after his September arrest and has remained held without bail at a federal lockup in Brooklyn.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian granted the defense lawyers' request to delay the last step in jury selection until Monday, when both sides will narrow down the pool of 45 people to 12 jurors and six alternates. Generally, lawyers do not have to explain why they are ejecting individuals from the panel.",
      "The defense said striking prospective jurors could take as little as 10 to 15 minutes, so why not do it on Monday when they will be present. The jurors weren\u2019t required to be in the Manhattan courtroom on Friday, but Combs was there.",
      "Prosecutors objected, saying the whole process could get gummed up if several jurors panic after being chosen and decide they don\u2019t want to take part in a high-profile trial that's expected to last two months.",
      "Would-be jurors were asked questions earlier this week to help the judge and lawyers determine if they could be fair and impartial. And they were also questioned to ensure they could decide the case on the facts \u2014 even after seeing explicit videos of sexual activity that some might find disturbing.",
      "On Monday, prosecutors will be permitted to strike six prospective jurors from the jury while defense lawyers were allowed 10 strikes before the jury is finalized. The process is expected to take up to an hour.",
      "If Combs is convicted on all charges, which include racketeering, kidnapping, arson, bribery and sex trafficking, he would face a mandatory 15 years in prison and could remain behind bars for life.",
      "Prosecutors allege the Bad Boy Records founder used his fame and power at the top of the hip-hop world to sexually abuse women from 2004 to 2024.",
      "An indictment includes descriptions of \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d drugged-up orgies in which women were forced to have sex with male sex workers while Combs filmed them.",
      "The charges against him also portray Combs as abusive to his victims, sometimes choking, hitting, kicking and dragging them, often by the hair. Once, the indictment alleges, he even dangled someone from a balcony.",
      "His lawyers say prosecutors are trying to criminalize sexual activity between consenting adults. They concede that Combs had abused various substances but say he has undergone treatment.",
      "A centerpiece of the evidence against him are recordings of Combs beating a longtime girlfriend in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016.",
      "After a video of the encounter aired on CNN last year, Combs apologized, saying, \u201cI take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I\u2019m disgusted now.\u201d",
      "Numerous prospective jurors told the judge they'd seen the video and some were deemed too affected by it to be impartial.",

      "NEW YORK -- A former model tearfully testified Thursday that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her when she was 16 years old, calling it the most \u201chorrifying thing I ever experienced\u201d to that point.",
      "Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola, an aspiring actor at the time, told jurors at Weinstein\u2019s #MeToo retrial that the onetime movie honcho put his hand inside her underwear and made her touch his genitals at a Manhattan apartment in 2002.",
      "Sokola said she saw Weinstein\u2019s eyes \u2014 \u201cblack and scary\u201d \u2014 staring at her in a bathroom mirror as it happened.",
      "Afterward, she said, he told her to keep quiet about what had happened, touting that he'd made the careers of A-listers like Gwyneth Paltrow and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and that he could help her Hollywood dreams come true.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d never been in a situation like this,\u201d Sokola testified, as riveted jurors scribbled notes. \u201cI felt stupid and ashamed and like it\u2019s my fault for putting myself in this position.\u201d",
      "Weinstein is not charged with any crime in connection with the alleged assault, which Sokola first detailed in a lawsuit a few years ago. The timing put it outside the statute of limitations for criminal charges.",
      "Sokola is testifying because Weinstein is charged with forcibly performing oral sex on her at a Manhattan hotel four years later, around the time of her 20th birthday. Prosecutors say it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries.\u201d",
      "Sokola reported the allegation to authorities a few days into Weinstein\u2019s first trial in 2020, but was not a part of that case. Prosecutors added her to the retrial, joining two women who testified in the first case, after his conviction was overturned last year.",
      "Weinstein, now 73, looked down and away from Sokola as she recounted the earlier allegation, pressing his left thumb and index finger against his face like a shield.",
      "Sokola testified that she first met the then-studio boss at a Manhattan restaurant in 2002, three or four days before the alleged assault. During the short chat, she said, Weinstein asked her if she wanted to be an actress.",
      "A few days later, she said, he invited her to lunch \u2014 ostensibly to talk about acting \u2014 but instead took her to an apartment, where led her into a bedroom and then a bathroom, instructed her to take her top off and assaulted her.",
      "\u201cHe told me to talk my clothes off and I didn\u2019t want to do that. I was panicking,\u201d Sokola testified. \u201cAnd then he said that if I want to be an actress, that\u2019s what actors do in films, so I should get used to it. If a director says you have you take your clothes off, you have to take your clothes off. I was scared. I was scared of him.\u201d",
      "Sokola avoided looking at Weinstein as she walked to the witness stand \u2014 testifying for a second day after detailing on Wednesday her upbringing in Poland, entr\u00e9e into modeling and her professional career as a psychotherapist and author who recently launched a film production company. She peered briefly at Weinstein when asked Thursday to point him out in court.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults. The women, meanwhile, say the then-producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "Sokola sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "Prosecutors have said they began investigating Sokola\u2019s claims in 2020 but set the inquiry aside after Weinstein was convicted. They revived the investigation after New York\u2019s highest court reversed his conviction.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola out of the retrial, accusing prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case\u201d to try to bolster other accusers\u2019 credibility.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",

      "\u201cEvery musician\u2019s dream in the early '60s was to make it big in the U.S. charts,\" Daltrey said. \u201cFor The Who, that dream came true in 1967 and our lives were changed forever.\u201d",
      "The band went from performing club shows to headlining the Woodstock festival in the U.S. and becoming one of the biggest box-office draw in the world. The band were inducted into the Rock n\u2019 Roll Hall Of Fame in 1990.",
      "Daltrey, 81, and Townshend, two years his junior, have been one of rock's most prolific double acts, surviving the deaths of drummer Keith Moon in 1978 and bass guitarist John Entwistle in 2002.",
      "\u201cToday, Roger and I still carry the banner for the late Keith Moon and John Entwistle, and, of course, all of our long-time Who fans,\" Townshend said. \u201cI must say that although the road has not always been enjoyable for me, it is usually easy: the best job I could ever have had. I keep coming back.\u201d",
      "Though Daltrey didn\u2019t write songs, he was able to channel Townsend\u2019s many and complicated moods \u2014 defiance and rage, vulnerability and desperation.",
      "Together, they forged some of rock\u2019s most defining sounds: the stuttering, sneering delivery of \u201cMy Generation,\u201d the anguished cry of \u201cThey\u2019re all wasted!\u201d from \u201cBaba O\u2019Reilly,\u201d and the all-time scream from \u201cWon\u2019t Get Fooled Again.\u201d",
      "Pre-sales will run from May 13 ahead of the general sale beginning May 16.",
      "\u201cWell, all good things must come to an end. It is a poignant time,\" Townshend said. \u201cFor me, playing to American audiences and those in Canada has always been incredible.\u201d",

      "Kali Uchis wrote the album that she knew her future self would need to listen to",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Kali Uchis wrote the album she knew her future self would need to listen to. The Grammy-winning artist unknowingly was crafting her own audible remedy.",
      "\u201cI really did make the music that I needed for my grieving process, for just the place that I\u2019m at in my life right now,\u201d she says of the album out Friday.",
      "\u201cSincerely,\u201d (yes, the title includes the comma) began as a collection of letters to herself, friends and loved ones but took on a deeper meaning as the Colombian American songwriter gave birth to her first child and processed her mother's recent death. The first single, \u201cSunshine & Rain...,\u201d includes a clip of Uchis' mother saying, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d",
      "\u201cI wanted to immortalize her in the project,\u201d said Uchis. \u201cI thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album.\u201d",
      "The 14-track album finds Uchis proudly wearing her heart on her sleeve with songs like \u201cDaggers!,\u201d where Uchis encourages a close friend to lean into self-love, or \u201cILYSMIH,\u201d which includes baby coos at the beginning and was written as she lay in her hospital bed with her newborn.",
      "Uchis hopes that after listening to her fifth full album, fans will feel more connected to themselves and more in touch with their emotions: \u201cI hope it will give them some type of solace.\"",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "UCHIS: I\u2019m a very deep feeler. I\u2019m very empathetic. I feel a lot. And I wanted to make a body of work that fully showed that vulnerability and that actually really dug deep into my heart in a way that none of my other albums ever had.",
      "I felt like I was ready to do that because I\u2019ve been making music long enough that I felt that it was that time for me, and then it just so happened that, shortly after working on the album, I became pregnant, which was such a big part of being able to feel even deeper than I ever have.",
      "UCHIS: It\u2019s crazy because a lot of times I feel, and especially with this album in particular, I felt that I really made music that my future self would need, that I didn\u2019t realize I was going to need at that time.",
      "The album is actually dedicated to my mom. My mom later ended up getting diagnosed, and she\u2019s no longer here. ... And so pretty much all of the songs ended up taking on a deeper meaning to me because of that and because of it being dedicated to her. ... At the time, I might not have even realized subconsciously that I was making all of this to heal myself.",
      "UCHIS: At one point, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna make sure each of these songs is like, this is my letter to the world, this is my letter to this person, this my letter to that, this one to myself.\u201d I tried to really conceptualize in a different way that I never have when making any other album. And then ... when my mom passed, a lot of what I had left from her is letters that she wrote to me, and so it ended up, like I said, just more and more reasons for me to realize that it was the correct title for the project.",
      "UCHIS: I never stick to one process, but one particular process that stuck out to me on a lot of the songs was that most of them were written with no music, just songs that came to me.",
      "For instance, \u201cILYSMIH\u201d \u2014 that one literally I was just recovering from labor, my son was sleeping next to me; I was still in my hospital bed when I got this idea for this song and started it, started recording it on my phone, started writing some lyrics down. ... There\u2019s one called \u201cAll I Can Say.\u201d I wrote that whole song in the car on the way to the studio. ... I try to just make beauty out of all of my experiences.",
      "UCHIS: Thematically, nature is kind of a reoccurring theme in my music because I am so inspired by nature and I feel nature is where God exists and nature is where a lot of my creativity just thrives.",
      "I feel like it just happened. Afterwards, I even thought, \u201cIs this too similar to what I\u2019ve already done?\u201d But \u2026 I just love the things that I love, and I just returned back to those nostalgic elements. I may branch out and try what people think is different sounds. Like on \u201cOrqu\u00eddeas,\u201d I did a lot of different genre-bending on \u201cSin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)\" as well, but to me, that\u2019s still nostalgic because it\u2019s still music I grew up listening to.",
      "I return a lot to things that are core memories for me. It\u2019s soothing to my nervous system. I\u2019m the person who watches the same episodes of my favorite TV shows over and over again, ... I think that\u2019s what makes it beautiful too, is to see the evolution and know that it\u2019s still true to me. It's still true to my roots in music and where I started, but an evolved version.",
      "UCHIS: After she passed, one of the first things I did was go through all of the audio messages that she had ever sent me and I was just listening to all her messages over and over, wanting to hear her voice. When I heard that one I just thought of, \u201cOh how perfect is this that the song is called \u2018Sunshine &Rain...,\u2019 and she had said, \u201cGood morning, sunshine.\u201d It was for my son that she sent that message. I thought it was just a beautiful way to open the album, considering that it\u2019s dedicated to her.",
      "I struggled a lot with whether or not I wanted to share because I\u2019m a very, very private person. So I struggled a lot with if I even wanted to share that my mom was no longer here, but I felt I just had to not be afraid of that vulnerability and not pretend like it didn\u2019t affect me or didn\u2019t have some type of impact on me when it had such a big impact on me and still does. And I wanted to also honor her and honor her life in a way through art that I know that she would have loved and that she would have been proud of.",

    "story": [
      "A scrappy opera company that started 11 years ago in New York City is thriving by staying small",
      "NEW YORK -- Dan Schlosberg remembers the day 11 years ago when his upstart opera company put on its first performance \u2014 in a yoga studio before an audience of 30 people.",
      "\u201cWe did Kurt Weill\u2019s \u2018The Seven Deadly Sins\u2019 accompanied by an upright piano that we got for free on Craigslist and a violin,\u201d recalled Schlosberg, the company\u2019s music director and one of its founders.",
      "They named their company Heartbeat Opera, \u201cfrom the idea that singers would be feet away from you,\u201d Schlosberg said. \u201cAnd so you would be experiencing their voices at arm\u2019s length and that would make a resonance in your heart.\u201d",
      "Today, in an era when many opera companies are struggling financially, Heartbeat appears to be thriving, with an annual budget that just passed $1 million.",
      "But true to its initial vision, the company still performs in small venues, most with a seating capacity of about 200.",
      "\u201cVery few small companies take up the ambition to do the fullness of opera on a small scale,\u201d said Jacob Ashworth, another founding member and Heartbeat\u2019s artistic director. \u201cWe don\u2019t do small opera. We do big opera in a small space.\u201d",
      "And despite its success with critics and audiences \u2014 performances regularly sell out \u2014 the company has deliberately maintained a modest schedule.",
      "There\u2019s typically an opera-themed drag show around Halloween and then two operas staged in New York City performance spaces in the winter and spring. Each work is condensed to 90-100 intermission-less minutes with new orchestrations that require just a few musicians.",
      "Marc Scorca, president and CEO of Opera America, thinks Heartbeat is smart not to expand too quickly \u2014 a mistake that has caused some small companies to collapse.",
      "\u201cGrowth itself shouldn\u2019t be a goal. Excellence should be a goal,\u201d he said. \u201cI always prefer companies to plan their trajectory as slow as possible so they don\u2019t overstretch and overstep.\u201d",
      "Unlike some small companies, Heartbeat doesn\u2019t focus on new work or on bringing to light neglected old rarities. Instead, its website promises \u201cincisive adaptations and revelatory arrangements of classics, reimagining them for the here and now.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s that reimagining that attracted Sara Holdren, a director, writer and teacher who first worked with the company on Bizet\u2019s \u201cCarmen\u201d in 2017.",
      "\u201cTheir approaches to the storytelling feel extremely of our world and about our world,\u201d she said, \u201cwithout falling across that line into a sort of trite topicality where you say, \u2018Oh yes, I understand a relevant-with-a-capital-R political point is being made here\u2019.\u201d",
      "For Beethoven\u2019s \u201cFidelio,\u201d Heartbeat went to prisons and recorded the voices of incarcerated people, who appeared on video singing the Prisoners Chorus. For Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201cEugene Onegin,\u201d the two main male characters became lovers, reflecting the composer\u2019s own sexuality.",
      "And for Richard Strauss\u2019 \u201cSalome\u201d this season, the teenage title character was dressed in a frilly pink skirt and sneakers; John the Baptist was imprisoned on stage in a cage with transparent sides instead of in an underground cistern; and during the Dance of the Seven Veils, it was a lascivious Herod who stripped off his clothes, not Salome.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s casting for \u201cSalome\u201d reflected the premium it places on theatrical values in addition to vocal ability.",
      "Baritone Nathaniel Sullivan, who portrayed John the Baptist, recalled that \u201ca big part of the audition was just straight acting. And in the rehearsals, there was a real focus on the storytelling.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t experienced that in a lot of other opera companies to that extent,\u201d he said.",
      "Soprano Summer Hassan, who was cast as Salome, admits she was nervous at first \u201cbecause I had never done a role like this where I am the title character.",
      "\u201cI was really doubting myself, thinking how do I make this girl look so young?\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they said, your physicality will do that on your own. Make her look confident and you will make her look like a confident child. They gave me the tools to figure out it was within me.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the most striking aspect of this \u201cSalome\u201d was the re-orchestration by Schlosberg. Instead of more than 100 players as called for in the original, he took a cue from the opening notes on a clarinet and scored the piece for eight clarinetists (who also played other instruments) and two percussionists.",
      "Heartbeat\u2019s final local offering of the season will be Gounod\u2019s \u201cFaust,\u201d to run at the Baruch Performing Arts Center from May 13-25.",
      "\u201cI had mentioned to Jacob that I really love devil stories,\u201d said Holdren, who is directing the production. \u201cAnd I was fascinated with the idea of taking something so big and so weighed down with history and assumptions and seeing how much we could crack it open and blow the dust off.\u201d",
      "She sees Mephistopheles less as a \u201dmustache-twirling villain\u201d and more as \u201ca figure of hunger and loneliness slipping into the vacuums that human beings create when they are so desperate or disgusted with life that there\u2019s an opening for him.\u201d",
      "Her production will be set in contemporary times, sung in French but with new English-language dialogue, and it will make heavy use of shadow puppetry. It\u2019s the first Heartbeat offering for which Schlosberg has not done the re-orchestration.",
      "That task fell to Francisco Ladr\u00f3n de Guevara, a Mexican violinist and composer who has scored the opera for seven musicians, most of whom play two instruments, including Ashworth, who will play violin and mandolin and also conduct.",
      "Schlosberg will be back doing the arranging for a rare Heartbeat foray outside the city this summer. The company has been invited to stage a revised version of Samuel Barber\u2019s \u201cVanessa\u201d at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really excited by what they\u2019ve been doing, particularly in reimagining the classics for contemporary times,\" said Raphael Picciarelli, co-managing director of the festival.",
      "For Heartbeat\u2019s debut in Williamstown, the festival is setting up a new performance space that should make the company feel right at home. It\u2019s in an abandoned grocery store, and there will be seats for just over 200 people.",

      "Smokey Robinson\u2019s lawyer says allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\u201d and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Smokey Robinson's lawyer said allegations of rape and sexual assault against him in a lawsuit from four former housekeepers are \u201cvile\" and \u201cfalse.\u201d",
      "Attorney Christopher Frost said in a statement Wednesday that the evidence \u201cwill show that this is simply an ugly method of trying to extract money from an 85-year-old American icon.\u201d",
      "The suit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday against the Motown music luminary seeks at least $50 million in damages over the alleged assaults, which the women say took place between 2007 and 2024. Robinson's wife, Frances Robinson, is also named as a defendant for allegedly enabling his behavior and creating an abusive work environment.",
      "\u201cWe will be addressing the numerous aspects of the complaint that defy credulity as well as issues relating to purported timelines, inconsistencies, and relationships between the plaintiffs and others,\u201d Frost's statement said.",
      "The four women each allege that Smokey Robinson would wait until he was alone with them in his Los Angeles house and then sexually assault and rape them over their objections, in some cases for many years.",
      "\u201cWe believe that Mr. Robinson is a serial and sick rapist, and must be stopped,\u201d the women\u2019s attorney John Harris said at a news conference Tuesday.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they publicly identify themselves. The women, whose names are withheld in the lawsuit, appeared with their lawyers at the news conference. They didn't speak, and they covered their faces with masks.",
      "Frost called the news conference \u201cbizarre theatrics,\u201d and an attempt to \u201cenlist the public as an unwitting participant in the media circus they are trying to create. We ask anyone following this case to reserve judgment as the evidence comes to light and all the actual facts of the case unfold.\u201d",
      "One woman said that she worked for Robinson from 2012 until 2024, and was assaulted at least 20 times in that span. Another said that she worked for him from 2014 until 2020, and was assaulted at least 23 times.",
      "All of the accusers said they eventually quit over the assaults, though in some cases it took several years. And all said they feared coming forward over fears of retaliation, public shame and possible effects on their immigration status. The same fears have kept the women from going to police to report Robinson, their lawyers said, though they also said they believe criminal investigation is warranted.",
      "The suit seeks damages based on sexual battery, assault, false imprisonment, gender violence and other allegations.",
      "Frost said that Robinson would soon address the allegations himself, and that they would be asking the court to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Robinson, a member of both the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, was among the biggest hitmakers of the 1960s as a central part of the Motown Records machine \u2014 both with his group the Miracles and as a solo artist, with songs including \u201cTears of a Clown\" and \u201cThe Tracks of My Tears.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former model who alleges that Harvey Weinstein sexually assaulted her almost 20 years ago has taken the stand at his retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- Days into Harvey Weinstein 's first sexual assault trial in 2020, prosecutors privately spoke for the first time with a former model who alleged that he had forced oral sex on her.",
      "But that jury was never told about Kaja (KEYE\u2019-ah) Sokola's claim. Prosecutors have said they still were investigating the allegation when Weinstein, a onetime movie tycoon-turned- #MeToo pariah, was convicted in February 2020 of charges based on other women's accusations.",
      "On Wednesday, Sokola began to tell a new jury her story.",
      "Sokola didn't look at Weinstein as she walked past him and onto the witness stand in a Manhattan courtroom where he's on trial again. An appeals court overturned his 2020 rape and sexual assault conviction, sending those charges back for retrial, and prosecutors subsequently added another sexual assault charge based on Sokola's allegations.",
      "As she began testifying about her life before the alleged 2006 assault, Weinstein looked toward her, with his right hand across his mouth.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. His lawyers contend that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with him in hopes of getting movie and TV opportunities, and the defense has emphasized that the women stayed in contact with him for a while after the alleged assaults.",
      "The women, meanwhile, say the Oscar-winning producer used the prospect of show business work to prey on them.",
      "The Polish-born Sokola, 39, sued Weinstein after industry whispers about his behavior toward women became a chorus of public accusations in 2017, fueling the #MeToo movement and its calls for accountability for sexual misconduct. Prosecutors have said Sokola eventually received $3.5 million in compensation.",
      "She was introduced to Weinstein while on a modeling trip to New York in 2002, when she was 16, according to prosecutors.",
      "In her lawsuits, Sokola said that shortly after she met Weinstein, he invited her to lunch to discuss her career but then sexually assaulted her. The lawsuits alleged he sexually harassed and emotionally abused her for years afterward.",
      "The criminal charge stems from one instance when Sokola maintains that Weinstein forcibly performed oral sex on her in a Manhattan hotel in May 2006.",
      "Prosecutors have said it happened after Weinstein arranged for Sokola to be an extra in the film \u201cThe Nanny Diaries\u201d and met her visiting older sister, whom she was trying to impress.",
      "\u201cShe was proud of knowing him,\u201d her sister, cardiologist Dr. Ewa (pronounced EH\u2019-vah) Sokola, told jurors Wednesday.",
      "She said the three of them met in a hotel lobby, chatted for about an hour about Italian movies and the heavyset Weinstein's heart health, and then he and the model left the table together.",
      "Kaja Sokola was tense when she returned about a half-hour later \u2014 \u201clike somebody waiting for the result of an exam\u201d or the Oscars \u2014 but didn't say anything about the alleged sexual assault, Dr. Sokola told jurors.",
      "She said she was shocked to learn about the claim over a decade later, when she read about it in a magazine article.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers will get a chance to question Kaja Sokola in the coming days. In an opening statement last month, defense attorney Arthur Aidala questioned why she waited years to come forward. Prosecutors have argued that accusers were reluctant to speak up because of Weinstein's wealth and influence.",
      "Prosecutors have said Sokola's attorneys contacted them on the eve of Weinstein's first trial to say she was willing to be interviewed. Prosecutors have said they soon spoke with her and began investigating, but didn't initially pursue charges because Weinstein was convicted and the coronavirus pandemic loomed.",
      "They revived the Sokola investigation after New York's highest court reversed Weinstein's conviction.",
      "Weinstein's lawyers fought unsuccessfully to keep Sokola's allegation out of the retrial. They accused prosecutors of \u201csmuggling an additional charge into the case for the improper purpose of bolstering the credibility\u201d of other accusers.",
      "One of the others, Miriam Haley, testified last week that Weinstein forced oral sex on her in 2006. The third accuser in the case, Jessica Mann, is expected to testify later.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name sexual assault accusers without their permission, which Haley, Mann and Sokola have given.",

Looking for any tips you can give me \u2014 especially on my backswing and follow-through.\"",
      "Kelce said the early feedback was \u201ccrazy.\"",
      "\u201cSome of this stuff is like stuff other pros have put out and it's kind of generic stuff that everybody can use,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cBut there's been some stuff so far that's been like, \u2018Holy cow, I never thought about it like that.' So I'm excited about that.\u201d",
      "Kelce \u2014 who retired following the 2023 season after a 13-year career spent entirely with the Eagles, played his role as man of the people to perfection during a pro-am ahead of the Truist Championship. He took time to answer questions from 14-year-old Benji Panzer, a middle school student who had credentials as part of an area sports broadcasting camp. Panzer asked Kelce about his \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast that he tapes with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.",
      "\u201cThe ability of players to connect with fans directly has never been greater,\u201d Kelce told Panzer.",
      "Kelce connected with plenty of Eagles fans, signing everything from aluminum beer bottles, T-shirts, golf balls and all types of Eagles memorabilia. He accepted gifts, too, including a Kelly green Eagles beer koozie. One fan who called himself T-Shirt Phil \u2014 did we mention the tourney was near Philly? \u2014 said he wanted to introduce Kelce to Phillies slugger Nick Castellanos.",
      "The 37-year-old Kelce \u2014 who with wife and social media star Kylie, welcomed their fourth child Finnley \u201cFinn\u201d Anne Kelce in March \u2014 refused to name his favorite golf course in the area but seemed to enjoy the fast greens his first time at Philly Cricket\u2019s Wissahickon Course.",
      "\u201cThe course is in great shape,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous. All the guys we played with agreed.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe guys\u201d included PGA pros Stephan Jager and Shane Lowry.",
      "One unspecified member of the group sliced a ball into the crowd and struck the left hand of 25-year-old spectator Hudson Mokrejs, of Elverson, Pennsylvania, who needed an ice pack on his reddened wrist.",
      "\u201cWe were talking beforehand like, \u2018Man, wouldn\u2019t it be great to get hit by Jason Kelce's ball?' And then he shot it over the green,\u201d Mokrejs said. \u201cI was talking and all of a sudden I hear, \u2018Look out!\u2019 I turned and it just smacked me in the hand. I covered my hand. I didn't spill my drink. I had a Transfusion. Classic golf drink, you know what I mean? Chugged that real quick to get me healthy.\u201d",
      "Kelce noted the serene golf atmosphere made for more \u201cGo Birds\u201d chants more than the popular \u201cE-A-G-L-E-S\u201d chant that punctuates the Eagles\u2019 fight song.",

      "NEW YORK -- Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, the hip-hop entrepreneur whose wildly successful career has been dotted by allegations of violence, will be brought to a New York courthouse Monday to be tried on charges that he used the influence and resources of his business empire to sexually abuse women. Jury selection is scheduled to begin in the morning and potentially take several days. Opening statements by the lawyers and the start of testimony is expected next week.",
      "The 17-page indictment against Combs reads like a charging document filed against a Mafia leader or the head of a drug gang, accusing him of engaging in sex trafficking and presiding over a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "The indictment says that with the help of people in his entourage and employees from his network of businesses, Combs engaged in a two-decade pattern of abusive behavior against women and others.",
      "Women were manipulated into participating in drug-fueled sexual performances with male sex workers that Combs called \u201cFreak Offs,\u201d prosecutors say.",

      "Combs, 55, has acknowledged one episode of violence that is likely to be featured in the trial. In 2016, a security camera recorded him beating up his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel. Cassie filed a lawsuit in late 2023 saying Combs had subjected her to years of abuse, including beatings and rape.",

      "The trial is the latest and most serious in a long string of legal problems for Combs.",
      "In 1999 he was charged with bursting into the offices of an Interscope Records executive with his bodyguards and beating him with a champagne bottle and a chair. The executive, Steve Stoute, later asked prosecutors to go easy on Combs, who pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and took an anger management class.",
      "Later that same year, Combs was stopped by police after he and his then-girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, fled a nightclub where three people were wounded by gunfire. Combs was acquitted of all charges related to the incident at a 2001 trial, but a rapper in his entourage, Jamal \u201cShyne\u201d Barrow, was convicted in the shooting and served nearly nine years in prison.",
      "Then in 2015, Combs was charged with assaulting someone with a weight-room kettlebell at the the University of California, Los Angeles, where one of his sons played football. Combs said he was defending himself and prosecutors dropped the case.",
      "Now, Combs faces his most serious case yet.",
      "If convicted, he faces the possibility of decades in prison.",

      "The Brooklyn-based fashion designer had only been in the business for five years. Now, one of the world\u2019s top museums was asking for two of his designs to be shown in \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,\u201d the exhibit launched by the starry Met Gala.",

      "Agbobly grew up in Togo, watching seamstresses and tailors create beautiful garments in part of the family home that they rented out. Studying fashion later in New York, the aspiring designer watched the Met Gala carpet from afar and dreamed of one day somehow being part of it.",
      "\u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Costume Institute exhibit to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years devoted to menswear.

      "\u201cThe range is phenomenal,\u201d says guest curator Monica L. Miller, a Barnard College professor whose book, \u201cSlaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity,\u201d is a foundation for the show.",
      "\u201cIt's super exciting to showcase the designs of these younger and emerging designers,\u201d says Miller, who took The Associated Press through the show over the weekend before its unveiling at Monday\u2019s Met Gala, \u201cand to see the way they've been thinking about Black representation across time and across geography.\u201d",
      "The exhibit covers Black style over several centuries, but the unifying theme is dandyism, and how designers have expressed that ethos through history.",
      "For Agbobly, dandyism is \u201cabout taking space. As a Black designer, as a queer person, a lot of it is rooted in people telling us who we should be or how we should act \u2026 dandyism really goes against that. It\u2019s about showing up and looking your best self and taking up space and announcing that you're here.\u201d",
      "The exhibit, which opens to the public May 10, begins with its own definition: someone who \u201cstudies above everything else to dress elegantly and fashionably.\u201d",
      "Miller has organized it into 12 conceptual sections: Ownership, presence, distinction, disguise, freedom, champion, respectability, jook, heritage, beauty, cool and cosmopolitanism.",
      "The \u201cownership\u201d section begins with two livery coats worn by enslaved people.",
      "One of them, from Maryland, looks lavish and elaborate, in purple velvet trimmed with gold metallic threading. The garments were intended to show the wealth of their owners. In other words, Miller says, the enslaved themselves were items of conspicuous consumption.",
      "The other is a livery coat of tan broadcloth, likely manufactured by Brooks Brothers and worn by an enslaved child or adolescent boy in Louisiana just before the Civil War.",
      "Elsewhere, there's a contemporary, glittering ensemble by British designer Grace Wales Bonner, made of crushed silk velvet and embroidered with crystals and the cowrie shells historically used as currency in Africa.",
      "There's also a so-called \u201cdollar bill suit\u201d by the label 3.Paradis \u2014 the jacket sporting a laminated one-dollar bill stitched to the breast pocket, meant to suggest the absence of wealth.",
      "The \u201cdisguise\u201d section includes a collection of 19th-century newspaper ads announcing rewards for catching runaway enslaved people.",
      "The ads, Miller notes, would often describe someone who was \u201cparticularly fond of dress\u201d \u2014 or note that the person had taken large wardrobes. The reason was twofold: The fancy clothes made it possible for an enslaved person to cloak their identity. But also, when they finally made it to freedom, they could sell the clothing to help fund their new lives, Miller says.",
      "\u201cSo dressing above one\u2019s station sometimes was a matter of life and death,\u201d the curator says, \u201cand also enabled people to transition from being enslaved to being liberated.\u201d",
      "The contemporary part of this section includes striking embroidered jackets by the label Off-White that purposely play with gender roles \u2014 like displaying an ostensibly \u201cmale\u201d jacket on a female mannequin.",
      "Stopping by a set of portraits from the early 19th century, as abolitionism was happening in the North, Miller explains that the subjects are Black men who were successful, well off enough to commission or sit for portraits, and dressed \u201cin the finest fashions of the day.\u201d Like William Whipper, an abolitionist and wealthy lumber merchant who also founded a literary society.",
      "They represent the beginnings of a Black middle and upper middle class in America, Miller says. But she points out a group of racist caricatures in a case right across from the portraits.",
      "\u201cAlmost as soon as they are able to do this,\u201d she says, referring to the portraits, \u201cthey are stereotyped and degraded.\u201d",
      "W.E.B. Du Bois, Miller points out, was not only a civil rights activist but also one of the best-dressed men in turn-of-the-century America. He traveled extensively overseas, which meant he needed \u201cclothing befitting his status as a representative of Black America to the world.\u201d",
      "Objects in the display include receipts for tailors in London, and suit orders from Brooks Brothers or his Harlem tailor. There is also a laundry receipt from 1933 for cleaning of shirts, collars, and handkerchiefs.",
      "Also highlighted in this section: Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist, writer, and statesman and also \u201cthe most photographed man of the 19th century.\u201d",
      "The show includes his tailcoat of brushed wool, as well as a shirt embroidered with a \u201cD\u201d monogram, a top hat, a cane and a pair of sunglasses.",
      "One of Miller\u2019s favorite items in the heritage section is Agbobly\u2019s bright-colored ensemble based on the hues of bags that West African migrants used to transport their belongings.",
      "Also displayed is Agbobly\u2019s denim suit embellished with crystals and beads. It's a tribute not only to the hairbraiding salons where the designer spent time as a child, but also the earrings his grandmother or aunts would wear when they went to church.",
      "Speaking of family, Agbobly says that he ultimately did tell them \u2014 and everyone \u2014 about his \u201cpinch-me moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone knows about it,\u201d the designer says. \u201cI keep screaming. If I can scream on top of a hill, I will.\u201d",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) \u2014 Lady Gaga gave a free concert Saturday night in front of 2 million fans who poured onto Copacabana Beach for the biggest show of her career.",
      "\u201cTonight, we're making history. (...) Thank you for making history with me,\u201d Lady Gaga told a screaming crowd.",
      "The Mother Monster, as she is known, kicked off the show at around 22:10 p.m. local time with her 2011 song \u201cBloody Mary.\u201d Cries of joy rose from the tightly-packed fans who sang and danced shoulder-to-shoulder on the vast stretch of sand.",
      "Concert organizers said 2.1 million people attended the show.",
      "Lady Gaga performed her classic hits, including \u201cPoker Face\u201d and \u201cAlejandro,\u201d switching between an array of dresses including one with the colors of the Brazilian flag.",
      "Some fans - many of them young - arrived on the beach at the crack of dawn to secure a good spot, armed with snacks and drinks. They spent the day under a blazing sun, while others perched in trees, determined to get a panoramic view.",
      "\u201cToday is the best day of my life,\u201d said Manoela Dobes, a 27-year-old designer who was wearing a dress plastered with a photograph from when she met Lady Gaga in the United States in 2019. \u201cIt's surreal to be here.\u201d",
      "Madonna also turned Copacabana Beach into a massive dance floor last year.",
      "The large-scale performances are part of an effort led by City Hall to boost economic activity after Carnival and New Years\u2019 Eve festivities and the upcoming month-long Saint John\u2019s Day celebrations in June.",
      "\u201cIt brings activity to the city during what was previously considered the low season \u2013 filling hotels and increasing spending in bars, restaurants, and retail, generating jobs and income for the population,\u201d said Osmar Lima, the city\u2019s secretary of economic development, in a statement released by Rio City Hall\u2019s tourism department last month.",
      "Rio\u2019s City Hall said in a recent report that the show should inject at least 600 million reais (some $106 million) into Rio\u2019s economy.",
      "Similar concerts are scheduled to take place every year in May at least until 2028.",
      "Lady Gaga arrived in Rio in the early hours of Tuesday. The city has been alive with Gaga-mania since, as it geared up to welcome the pop star for her first show in the country since 2012. Rio\u2019s metro employees danced to Lady Gaga\u2019s 2008 hit song \u201cLoveGame\u201d and gave instructions for Saturday in a video. A free exhibition celebrating her career sold out.",
      "While the vast majority of attendees were from Rio, the event also attracted Brazilians from across the country and international visitors.",
      "More than 500,000 tourists poured into the city in the days leading up to the show, more than double the initial forecast, according to data from the local bus station and Tom Jobim airport, Rio\u2019s City Hall said in a statement on Friday.",
      "Ingrid Serrano, a 30-year-old engineer, made a cross-continent trip from Colombia to Brazil to attend the show.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been a 100% fan of Lady Gaga my whole life,\u201d said Serrano, who was wearing a T-shirt featuring Lady Gaga\u2019s outlandish costumes over the years.",
      "For her, the mega-star represents \u201ctotal freedom of expression - being who one wants without shame.\u201d",
      "Rio officials have a history of organizing huge concerts on Copacabana Beach. Madonna\u2019s show drew an estimated 1.6 million fans last year, while 4 million people flooded onto the beach for a 1994 New Year\u2019s Eve show by Rod Stewart in 1994. According to Guinness World Records, that was the biggest free rock concert in history.",
      "To ensure fans could hear the songs, sixteen sound towers were spread along the beach.",
      "Rio state\u2019s security plan included the presence of 3,300 military and 1,500 police officers, and 400 military firefighters.",
      "Among those present were Lady Gaga admirers who remember their disappointment in 2017, when the artist canceled a performance scheduled in Rio at the last minute due to health issues.",
      "Ricardo Filho, who has been a fan since childhood, said it was worth the wait.",
      "\u201cShe's the best artist in the world,\u201d the 25-year-old said, as chants of \u201cGaga, I love you\u201d in Portuguese rose from the crowd behind him.",

    "story": [
      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t accept vaccines; it\u2019s that easy. Because that\u2019s where freedom of expression comes in,\u201d said the man, Jacob Goertzen. \"If we can\u2019t make out own decisions, we don\u2019t live in a democracy.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",
      "\u201cThe Mennonite population has a lot of access to social media and family members in the U.S. and Canada, where there are a lot of myths that have taken hold and many more \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019 groups than we have in Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",
      "\u201cI have a daughter to keep afloat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not like I have the option to wait and pay for things, for food.\u201d",

      "LUSAKA, Zambia -- The United States will cut $50 million worth of aid a year to the southern African country of Zambia because of the \u201csystematic\" theft of medicines and medical supplies the money paid for, the U.S. ambassador said Thursday.",
      "The U.S. had discovered in 2021 that medicines and supplies that were meant to be provided free to Zambians had been taken and were being sold by pharmacies across the country, U.S. Ambassador to Zambia Michael Gonzales said at a press briefing.",
      "He said that an investigation of around 2,000 pharmacies in Zambia between 2021 and 2023 found that nearly half of them were selling medicines and products paid for by U.S. aid funds.",
      "The Zambian government had failed to do enough to address the corruption after the U.S. informed it of the theft scandal in April 2024, Gonzales said.",
      "There was no immediate government comment Thursday.",
      "The $50 million is part of $128 million the U.S. gives to Zambia a year for medicines, medical supplies and other support for its health sector. Gonzales said the cuts would affect medications for HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, three critical diseases affecting Zambians.",
      "\u201cThe United States is taking necessary steps to safeguard, and ensure the accountability of, American taxpayer funds,\u201d Gonzales said.",
      "The action was separate to President Donald Trump's decision to cut U.S. foreign aid across the world, Gonzales said.",
      "He said that the U.S. investigation into the theft also found that medications and supplies for Zambia paid for by the Global Fund and other international donors were also being sold in pharmacies.",
      "Gonzales said he had recommended to officials in Washington that the U.S. start cutting the aid from January next year to give Zambia time to plan new procurements of the life-saving drugs.",

      "A new U.S. government study provides the most complete picture yet of early-onset cancers, defined as cancer diagnosed before age 50",
      "Cancer before age 50 is rare, but increasing, in the United States and researchers want to know why.",
      "A new government study provides the most complete picture yet of early-onset cancers, finding that the largest increases are in breast, colorectal, kidney and uterine cancers. Scientists from the National Cancer Institute looked at data that included more than 2 million cancers diagnosed in people 15 to 49 years old between 2010 and 2019.",
      "Of 33 cancer types, 14 cancers had increasing rates in at least one younger age group. About 63% of the early-onset cancers were among women.",
      "\u201cThese kinds of patterns generally reflect something profound going on,\u201d said Tim Rebbeck of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who studies cancer risk and was not involved in the research. \u201cWe need to fund research that will help us understand.\"",
      "The findings were published Thursday in Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research.",
      "The researchers compared cancer rates in 2019 to what would be expected based on 2010 rates.",
      "Breast cancer made up the largest share of the excess cancers, with about 4,800 additional cases. There were 2,000 more colorectal cancers compared with what would be expected based on the 2010 rates. There were 1,800 more kidney cancers and 1,200 additional uterine cancers.",
      "Reassuringly, death rates were not rising for most cancers in the young adult age groups, although increasing death rates were seen for colorectal, uterine and testicular cancers.",
      "Explanations will take more research. The big databases used for the study don't include information on risk factors or access to care. Theories abound and a big meeting is planned later this year to bring together experts in the area.",
      "\u201cSeveral of these cancer types are known to be associated with excess body weight and so one of the leading hypotheses is increasing rates of obesity,\u201d said lead author Meredith Shiels of the National Cancer Institute.",
      "Advances in cancer detection and changes in screening guidelines could be behind some early diagnoses.",
      "For breast cancer, the trend toward women having a first child at older ages is a possible explanation. Pregnancy and breastfeeding are known to reduce risk.",
      "This isn't happening across the board. Cancer rates in people under 50 are going down for more than a dozen types of cancer, with the largest declines in lung and prostate cancers.",
      "Cigarette smoking has been declining for decades, which likely accounts for the drop in lung cancer among younger adults.",
      "The drop in prostate cancer is likely tied to updated guidelines discouraging routine PSA testing in younger men because of concerns about overtreatment.",

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Bill Gates was in Indonesia on Wednesday to discuss health and sustainable development initiatives with the leader of the world\u2019s fourth most populous country.",
      "Gates met President Prabowo Subianto at the colonial-style Merdeka palace in Jakarta to discuss global health, nutrition, financial inclusion and public digital infrastructure, Indonesia\u2019s presidential office said in a statement ahead of the meeting.",
      "The co-founder of Microsoft and Gates Foundation praised Indonesia's adoption of vaccines like Rotavirus for diarrhea and Pneumococcus for pneumonia and the country's efforts in reducing child mortality.",
      "He said ten million children under the age of five worldwide died when his foundation launched in 2000, with 90% of the deaths due to diarrhea, pneumonia or malaria. That number has now been cut in half to below five million, Gates said.",
      "\u201cIt's been an amazing time period. And there\u2019s many new tools coming,\u201d he told the meeting, which was also attended by prominent Indonesian businesspeople and philanthropists.",
      "Gates' foundation is currently developing a tuberculosis vaccine that's planned to be tested in Indonesia, Subianto said.",
      "\u201cThis is crucial because TB is still a deadly disease in the country,\u201d he said.",
      "Gates said that because rich countries don\u2019t have tuberculosis, \u201cit just doesn\u2019t get hardly any money for diagnostics or drugs or vaccines.\u201d",
      "Gates has granted more than $159 million to Indonesia since 2009. Much of it was allocated to the health sector, especially for vaccine procurement, Subianto said. Thanks to the funds, Subianto said Biofarma, a state-run pharmaceutical company, now can produce two billion doses of its polio vaccine every year, benefiting more than 900 million people in 42 countries.",
      "The Gates Foundation is also planning to roll out a micronutrient supplement for pregnant women in Indonesia in coming months.",
      "Subianto said that Gates will receive Indonesia's highest honor in New York during the U.N. General Assembly in September for his services to the country.",
      "During his first in-person visit to the Indonesian capital, Gates is also scheduled to visit a primary school in eastern Jakarta where more than 500 students were taking part of the program.",
      "The United Nations Children\u2019s Fund estimates that one in 12 Indonesian children younger than 5 suffers from low weight, while one in five is shorter than normal. Both conditions are caused by malnourishment.",
      "Indonesia launched an ambitious project this year to fight malnutrition that aims to feed nearly 90 million children and pregnant women. The program is expected to cost 450 trillion rupiah ($28 billion) through 2029.",
      "Critics question whether it is affordable. Investors and analysts have questioned the burden on state finances and the economy, and the project's ties with the interests of industrial lobby groups.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration says that a prominent medical contrarian and critic of the drug industry will head its vaccine center",
      "WASHINGTON -- Dr. Vinay Prasad, a prominent critic of the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration, has been named to oversee the health agency\u2019s program for vaccines and biotech drugs.",
      "FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary announced the appointment Tuesday in a message to agency staff, praising Prasad's \u201clong and distinguished history in medicine.\u201d",
      "Prasad is the latest in a series of medical contrarians and critics of COVID-19 measures to join the federal government under President Donald Trump.",
      "Unlike political roles such as FDA commissioner, the job Prasad is stepping into has traditionally been held by an FDA career scientist. His appointment raises new questions about whether vaccines and other new therapies will face unnecessary scrutiny from regulators.",
      "Prasad replaces Dr. Peter Marks, FDA\u2019s longtime vaccine chief who resigned in March after clashing with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over concerns about the safety of vaccinations.",
      "In a social media post, Prasad likened Marks to \u201ca bobblehead doll that just stamps approval.\"",
      "Last year, he told former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy that Americans would probably be better off without the FDA in its current form.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re talking about FDA 2024, I think they\u2019d probably be better off as a result of not having the FDA\u201d Prasad said during an appearance on Ramaswamy's podcast.",
      "A professor at the University of California San Francisco, Prasad's medical training is in cancer and blood disorders. He first came to prominence among academics for a series of papers scrutinizing the evidence behind new cancer therapies.",
      "Research by Prasad and his colleagues showed that many cancer drugs fast-tracked by the FDA have never been shown to improve or extend patient lives. Instead, the drugs are often approved based on alternate measures, such as the ability to shrink tumors, which are thought to predict their long-term benefits.",
      "The FDA has long defended this practice as a way of accelerating approval of medicines for desperately ill patients.",
      "During the COVID-19 pandemic, Prasad reached a much broader audience as a critic of mask mandates, lockdowns and moves to speed the availability of vaccine boosters from Pfizer and Moderna. Many of his views mirror those of other Trump appointees, including Makary and National Institutes of Health Director Jay Bhattacharya.",
      "In 2022, Prasad and Makary were co-authors on a paper attacking the recommendation for booster shots in teens and young adults, particularly boys and young men. Those patients received particular attention because early vaccinations showed a higher rate of myocarditis, a rare form of heart inflammation that is usually mild.",
      "The paper concluded that requiring booster shots in young people would cause more injury than benefit. None of the authors specialized in studying infectious diseases or vaccine reactions, prompting pushback from many health experts.",
      "In recent years, Prasad become a regular on podcasts associated with Kennedy\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d movement, which often portrays the FDA as beholden to the pharmaceutical industry.",
      "Prasad's appointment is likely to alarm drug and vaccine makers, who depend on the predictability of FDA standards and procedures to guide drug development plans that can span years or even decades.",

      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden",
      "Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Hospital have agreed to a $750 million settlement of hundreds of sexual abuse claims by patients of disgraced and imprisoned former gynecologist Robert Hadden, bringing total legal payouts in civil cases involving the ex-doctor to over $1 billion, according to the plaintiffs' lawyer.",
      "Hadden, now 66, was accused of molesting patients during a decades-long career at prestigious New York City hospitals including Columbia University Irving Medical Center and New York-Presbyterian. He was convicted by a jury in 2023 of federal sex crime charges and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.",
      "The new settlements, approved by a Manhattan judge Monday, come in 576 legal cases against the Ivy League school, the hospital and others over the abuse by Hadden, plaintiffs' attorney Anthony T. DiPietro said.",
      "\u201cThis victory is not just for the victims and survivors of Columbia University and The New York-Presbyterian Hospital\u2019s cover-up who bravely came forward, but for all of us who entrust medical institutions with our health care,\u201d DiPietro said in statement.",
      "\u201cFor far too long, Columbia and New York-Presbyterian have prioritized protecting their reputations over protecting their patients,\" he said. \"This settlement sends a powerful message that we\u2019re here to ensure that institutions covering up exploitation and abuse will be held fully accountable for their crimes.\u201d",
      "DiPietro said the average payout to plaintiffs from the new settlement will be about $1.3 million. Columbia previously agreed to $277 million in settlements with more than 200 other plaintiffs over Hadden's sexual abuse, he said.",
      "Columbia confirmed the settlement but not the amount Tuesday. Lawyers for the school and New York-Presbyterian did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "\u201cAs previously announced, Columbia is implementing a multi-pronged plan, including an external investigation, a survivors\u2019 settlement fund, and a series of new and updated patient safety policies and programs to address the abuses of Robert Hadden,\" the university said in statement responding to an Associated Press message specifically asking about the $750 million deal.",
      "\u201cWe deeply regret the pain that his patients suffered, and this settlement is another step forward in our ongoing work and commitment to repair harm and support survivors,\u201d it said. \"We commend the survivors for their bravery in coming forward.\u201d",
      "New York-Presbyterian referred questions about the settlement to Columbia, saying the school employed Hadden.",
      "One of the plaintiffs in the lawsuits, Laurie Maldonado, who sued Columbia, New York-Presbyterian, Hadden and others, said her case was not about money.",
      "\u201cIt's about accountability,\u201d she said in a statement provided by DiPietro. \"Columbia University enabled sadistic abuse, and now, they\u2019ve been forced to face the truth. We hope this sends a clear message to every institution: survivors will not be silenced, and those who protect abusers will be held responsible.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name victims of sexual assault unless they come forward publicly, like Maldonado has.",
      "Hadden\u2019s accusers also included Evelyn Yang, the wife of former presidential candidate and New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, who said Hadden abused her when she was pregnant with her first child.",
      "During Hadden's criminal trial, nine victims testified about how Hadden molested them during gynecology treatments, starting in the late 1980s, at prominent hospitals.",
      "Allegations of misconduct during examinations first surfaced in 2012. Hadden was indicted on state charges in 2014 as women kept coming forward. But in 2016, the office of the Manhattan district attorney at the time, Cyrus Vance Jr., allowed Hadden to plead guilty to two low-level felonies and a misdemeanor in a deal that required him to give up his medical license but did not require jail time and kept him out of the state\u2019s sex offender registry.",
      "Some of the women who had gone to state prosecutors were outraged, but their stories did not start receiving public attention until the #MeToo movement began gaining steam in 2017.",
      "Federal prosecutors in Manhattan got a grand jury indictment against Hadden in 2020, charges based on the fact that some patients at his New York offices had come into the city from other states.",
      "In November 2023, Columbia and Columbia University Irving Medical Center announced they would be notifying 6,500 former patients of Hadden of his federal sex crime convictions and giving victims the opportunity to apply for compensation from a $100 million settlement fund. The deadline to apply has been extended to May 15.",

    "story": [
      "Utah dentists say they\u2019re bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state\u2019s most vulnerable people",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- With Utah's first-in-the-nation ban on fluoride in public drinking water set to take effect Wednesday, dentists who treat children and low-income patients say they're bracing for an increase in tooth decay among the state's most vulnerable people.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed the law against the recommendation of many dentists and national health experts who warn removing fluoride will harm tooth development, especially in young patients without regular access to dental care.",
      "The bill\u2019s sponsor, Republican Rep. Stephanie Gricius, said she does not dispute that fluoride can have some benefits but thinks people should not be given it by the government without their informed consent.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. applauded Utah for being the first state to enact a ban and said he plans to direct the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoridation nationwide.",
      "Florida could soon become the second state to ban fluoride under a bill awaiting Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 signature. The Ohio and South Carolina legislatures are considering similar measures.",
      "A majority of Utah water systems already did not add fluoride. The state ranked 44th in the nation for the percentage of residents receiving fluoridated water, with about 2 in 5 receiving it in 2022, according to CDC data. The law will impact about 1.6 million people in Salt Lake City and elsewhere in northern Utah who are losing fluoridation, state officials say.",
      "Dentists in Salt Lake City over the past week said many patients were unaware of the upcoming ban, and most did not realize the city had been adding fluoride to their drinking water for nearly two decades.",
      "\u201cI did not know about a ban,\u201d said Noe Figueroa, a patient at Salt Lake Donated Dental Services, a clinic that provides free or heavily discounted dental treatment to low-income residents. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not good. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good at all.\u201d",
      "At Donated Dental, providers expect their monthslong waitlist for children's procedures to grow significantly and their need for volunteer dentists to skyrocket. The effects of the ban in children\u2019s teeth will likely be visible within the next year, said Sasha Harvey, the clinic\u2019s executive director.",
      "\u201cRight now, we\u2019re scheduling into August and September for some 2-, 3-, 4-year-olds that are in so much pain that they can\u2019t eat properly, and there\u2019s nothing we can do but tell parents, \u2018You\u2019re gonna have to wait.\u2019 It\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d Harvey said, adding that it's likely to get much worse.",
      "The fluoridation process involves supplementing the low levels of naturally occurring fluoride in most water to reach the 0.7 milligrams per liter recommended by the CDC for cavity prevention. Water treatment plants dump fluoride into the water in liquid or powder form and often use dosing pumps to adjust the levels.",
      "Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population receives fluoridated drinking water, according to health officials. It was long considered among the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "Fluoride fortifies teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. It\u2019s especially important to children whose teeth are still developing. For some low-income families, public drinking water containing fluoride may be their only source of preventative dental care.",
      "Some supporters of the Utah law pointed to studies linking high levels of fluoride exposure to illness and low IQ in kids. The National Institutes of Health says it\u2019s \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d to get a toxic dose from fluoride added to water or toothpaste at standard levels.",
      "The governor said that, like many people in Utah, he grew up and raised his children in a community without fluoridated water. Before signing the bill, Cox said there is no difference in health outcomes between communities with and without fluoride \u2014 a statement Utah dentists say is false.",
      "\u201cAny dentist can look in someone\u2019s mouth in Utah and tell exactly where they grew up. Did you grow up in a fluoridated area or a non-fluoridated area? We can tell by the level of decay,\u201d said Dr. James Bekker, a pediatric dentist at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.",
      "The law shifts responsibility to individuals, meaning all Utah residents will need to be proactive about their oral health, Harvey said. Most patients at her clinic only come in when a toothache becomes unbearable, and many cannot spare the few dollars a month needed to buy fluoride supplements to add to their drinking water at home.",
      "Figueroa, the free dental clinic patient, said other expenses take priority.",
      "Fluoride toothpaste alone is insufficient for children because it doesn't penetrate the tooth's outer layer, Bekker said. When a person regularly ingests fluoridated water, their saliva bathes the teeth in fluoride throughout the day and makes them stronger.",
      "Bekker said he recommends Utah parents add fluoride supplements to their children\u2019s drinking water. But for families who don\u2019t visit doctors regularly, that may prove difficult.",
      "Fluoride tablets require a prescription from a doctor or dentist. Utah providers are working to make the supplement accessible over the counter, but Bekker said that change may be months or years away.",

      "Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson is running for governor in 2026 and sharing new anecdotes in her upcoming political memoir, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d including her experience with miscarriage",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Ahead of a nationally watched bid to become Michigan\u2019s next governor, Democrat Jocelyn Benson is releasing a memoir this month that includes her first public discussion of a miscarriage she had about eight years ago \u2014 an experience she says will shape her commitment to increasing access to reproductive healthcare in the swing state.",
      "Benson, Michigan\u2019s secretary of state, is part of a crowded field seeking to succeed Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and she\u2019s the only woman in the running so far.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press ahead of Tuesday's release of her political memoir entitled, \u201cThe Purposeful Warrior,\u201d Benson said miscarrying made her value easy access to reproductive health care in an emotional and difficult situation, something she wants to deliver for the state if elected.",
      "\u201cIt opened my eyes to the need to not just protect reproductive freedom and rights, but actually make sure they\u2019re real,\u201d said Benson.",
      "In a chapter entitled \u201cGrit and Grace,\u201d Benson describes finding out she was pregnant shortly after her son\u2019s first birthday and shortly before she launched her bid for secretary of state in 2017. Waves of worry over the timing and elation over becoming a mother of two ensued. But just a day later, she began to miscarry.",
      "She writes about the doctor\u2019s appointment during her eighth week of pregnancy where she learned about her options: surgery, medication or stillbirth and what to expect as her miscarriage continued. By the following morning, she had miscarried on her own.",
      "\u201cThe emotional impact of that stays with you for your whole life,\u201d she told AP.",
      "Benson said she struggled with shame and guilt, emotions she has learned many women experience.",
      "\u201cI want to tell my story to say it\u2019s OK to tell yours as well,\u201d she said.",
      "In the years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, women seeking public office have shared personal stories of miscarriages and abortions. Democrats and Republicans alike have spoken about their pregnancies as reproductive and maternal health care became a central concern for Americans.",
      "In Michigan, voters approved a ballot measure in 2022 to protect abortion access, in an election that also saw Democrats sweep statewide and legislative elections. But Benson said that protection isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Step one is to incentivize talented physicians to work in Michigan, she said. Step two is to bolster reproductive health care in rural Michigan, she said, suggesting mobile clinics that can reach remote areas.",
      "She noted the recent closure of three Planned Parenthood locations in Michigan, including its only location in the Upper Peninsula. Some Planned Parenthood locations provide abortions in addition to services such as birth control, disease screenings and miscarriage management.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Michigan leaders cited financial challenges exacerbated by a freeze of federal dollars for the closures. Federal law already prohibited taxpayer dollars from paying for most abortions.",
      "Centering reproductive rights in the 2026 primary will be another test of the issue\u2019s importance to Democratic voters. Benson will face Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson in the gubernatorial primary. Whitmer, who is term limited, has said she does not plan to endorse in the race.",
      "On the Republican side, U.S. Rep. John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aaric Nesbitt and former Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox are vying for the nomination and likely also the endorsement of President Donald Trump.",
      "And the twist \u2014 Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is pursuing the office as an independent. The move comes as Democrats lost considerable ground in the 2024 election. The state swung back to Trump in the 2024 election and Republicans gained a majority in the state House of Representatives, splitting control of the legislature.",
      "Among anecdotes from her memoir that include her tenure as the state's chief election official during the 2020 election and her law career before, Benson took a swing at Duggan over his handling of the 2018 primary election for governor. She criticized him for not supporting Whitmer early in the race and encouraging other Democrats, who are men, to pursue a run, citing reporting in the New Yorker years later.",
      "\u201cI will never forget the message those efforts sent to women across our state,\u201d Benson wrote. She noted that her own primary campaign became tied to Whitmer\u2019s by gender.",
      "\u201cThe argument went something like, surely we can\u2019t have more than one woman on the ticket at the same time,\u201d Benson wrote.",
      "Benson\u2019s memoir comments on Duggan were first reported by the Detroit News. A spokesperson for Duggan\u2019s campaign told the publication that the Detroit mayor endorsed Whitmer in the Democratic primary over two men.",

      "Attorneys general in 19 states and Washington, D.C., are challenging cuts to the U.S. Health and Human Services agency, saying the Trump administration's massive restructuring has destroyed life-saving programs and left states to pick up the bill for mounting health crises.",
      "The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Rhode Island on Monday, New York Attorney General Letitia James said. The attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Michigan, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia signed onto the complaint.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. restructured the agency in March, eliminating more than 10,000 employees and collapsing 28 agencies under the sprawling HHS umbrella into 15, the attorneys general said. An additional 10,000 employees had already been let go by President Donald Trump's administration, according to the lawsuit, and combined the cuts stripped 25% of the HHS workforce.",
      "\u201cIn its first three months, Secretary Kennedy and this administration deprived HHS of the resources necessary to do its job,\u201d the attorneys general wrote.",
      "Kennedy has said he is seeking to streamline the nation's public health agencies and reduce redundancies across them with the layoffs. The cuts were made as part of a directive the administration has dubbed, \u201c Make America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "HHS is one of the government's costliest federal agencies, with an annual budget of about $1.7 trillion that is mostly spent on health care coverage for millions of people enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "James, who is leading the lawsuit, called the restructuring a \u201csweeping and unlawful assault\u201d that would endanger lives.",
      "\u201cThis is not government reform. This is not efficiency,\u201d James said during a press conference Monday.",
      "The cuts have resulted in laboratories having limited testing for some infectious diseases, the federal government not tracking cancer risks among U.S. firefighters, early childhood learning programs left unsure of future funds and programs aimed at monitoring cancer and maternal health closing, the attorneys general say. Cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have hampered states' ability to respond to one of the largest measles outbreaks in recent years, the lawsuit says.",
      "\u201cThis chaos and abandonment of the Department\u2019s core functions was not an unintended side effect, but rather the intended result,\u201d of the \u201cMAHA Directive,\u201d they said. They want a judge to vacate the directive because they say the administration can't unilaterally eliminate programs and funding that have been created by Congress.",
      "The restructuring eliminated the entire team of people who maintain the federal poverty guidelines used by states to determine whether residents are eligible for Medicaid, nutrition assistance and other programs. A tobacco prevention agency was gutted. Staff losses also were significant at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",
      "The Trump administration is already facing other legal challenges over cuts to public health agencies and research organizations. A coalition of 23 states filed a federal lawsuit in Rhode Island last month over the administration's decision to cut $11 billion in federal funds for COVID-19 initiatives and various public health projects across the country.",

      "More than a dozen data-gathering programs that track deaths and disease appear to have been eliminated in the tornado of layoffs and proposed budget cuts in the Trump administration\u2019s first 100 days",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s motto is \u201c Make America Healthy Again,\u201d but government cuts could make it harder to know if that's happening.",
      "More than a dozen data-gathering programs that track deaths and disease appear to have been eliminated in the tornado of layoffs and proposed budget cuts rolled out in the Trump administration's first 100 days.",
      "The Associated Press examined draft and final budget proposals and spoke to more than a dozen current and former federal employees to determine the scope of the cuts to programs tracking basic facts about Americans' health.",
      "Among those terminated at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were experts tracking abortions, pregnancies, job-related injuries, lead poisonings, sexual violence and youth smoking, the AP found.",
      "\"If you don\u2019t have staff, the program is gone,\u201d said Patrick Breysse, who used to oversee the CDC\u2019s environmental health programs.",
      "Federal officials have not given a public accounting of specific surveillance programs that are being eliminated.",
      "Instead, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman pointed the AP to a Trump administration budget proposal released Friday. It lacked specifics, but proposes to cut the CDC's core budget by more than half and vows to focus CDC surveillance only on emerging and infectious diseases.",
      "Kennedy has said some of the CDC's other work will be moved to a yet-to-be-created agency, the Administration for a Healthy America. He also has said that the cuts are designed to get rid of waste at a department that has seen its budget grow in recent years.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this extra spending and staff has not improved our nation\u2019s health as a country,\" Kennedy wrote last month in The New York Post. \"Instead, it has only created more waste, administrative bloat and duplication.\"",
      "Yet some health experts say the eliminated programs are not duplicative, and erasing them will leave Americans in the dark.",
      "\u201cIf the U.S. is interested in making itself healthier again, how is it going to know, if it cancels the programs that helps us understand these diseases?\u201d said Graham Mooney, a Johns Hopkins University public health historian.",
      "The core of the nation\u2019s health surveillance is done by the CDC\u2019s National Center for Health Statistics. Relying on birth and death certificates, it generates information on birth rates, death trends and life expectancy. It also operates longstanding health surveys that provide basic data on obesity, asthma and other health issues.",
      "The center has been barely touched in layoffs, and seems intact under current budget plans.",
      "But many other efforts were targeted by the cuts, the AP found. Some examples:",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, which surveys women across the country, lost its entire staff \u2014 about 20 people.",
      "It\u2019s the most comprehensive collection of data on the health behaviors and outcomes before, during and after childbirth. Researchers have been using its data to investigate the nation's maternal mortality problem.",
      "Recent layoffs also wiped out the staffs collecting data on in vitro fertilizations and abortions.",
      "Those cuts are especially surprising given that President Donald Trump said he wants to expand IVF access and that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook for his administration called for more abortion surveillance.",
      "The CDC eliminated its program on lead poisoning in children, which helped local health departments \u2014 through funding and expertise \u2014 investigate lead poisoning clusters and find where risk is greatest.",
      "Lead poisoning in kids typically stems from exposure to bits of old paint, contaminated dust or drinking water that passes through lead pipes. But the program's staff also played an important role in the investigation of lead-tainted applesauce that affected 500 kids.",
      "Last year, Milwaukee health officials became aware that peeling paint in aging local elementary schools was endangering kids. The city health department began working with CDC to test tens of thousands of students. That assistance stopped last month when the CDC\u2019s lead program staff was terminated.",
      "City officials are particularly concerned about losing expertise to help them track the long-term effects.",
      "\"We don't know what we don't know,\" said Mike Totoraitis, the city\u2019s health commissioner.",
      "Also gone is the staff for the 23-year-old Environmental Public Health Tracking Program, which had information on concerns including possible cancer clusters and weather-related illnesses.",
      "\u201cThe loss of that program is going to greatly diminish the ability to make linkages between what might be in the environment and what health might be affected by that,\u201d Breysse said.",
      "In some cases, it\u2019s not a matter of staffers leaving, but rather the end of specific types of data collection.",
      "Transgender status is no longer being recorded in health-tracking systems, including ones focused on violent deaths and on risky behaviors by kids.",
      "Experts know transgender people are more likely to be victims of violence, but now \u201cit\u2019s going to be much more challenging to quantify the extent to which they are at higher risk,\u201d said Thomas Simon, the recently retired senior director for scientific programs at the CDC's Division of Violence Prevention.",
      "The staff and funding seems to have remained intact for a CDC data collection that provides insights into homicides, suicides and accidental deaths involving weapons.",
      "But CDC violence-prevention programs that acted on that information were halted. So, too, was work on a system that collects hospital data on nonfatal injuries from causes such as shootings, crashes and drownings.",
      "Also going away, apparently, is the CDC's National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey. The system is designed to pick up information that's not found in law enforcement statistics. Health officials see that work as important, because not all sexual violence victims go to police.",
      "The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which tracks job-related illnesses and deaths and makes recommendations on how to prevent them, was gutted by the cuts.",
      "Kennedy has said that 20% of the people laid off might be reinstated as the agency tries to correct mistakes.",
      "That appeared to happen last month, when the American Federation of Government Employees said that NIOSH workers involved in a black lung disease program for coal miners had been temporarily called back.",
      "But HHS officials did not answer questions about the reinstatement. The AFGE's Micah Niemeier-Walsh later said the workers continued to have June termination dates and \u201cwe are concerned this is to give the appearance that the programs are still functioning, when effectively they are not.\u201d",
      "There's been no talk of salvaging some other NIOSH programs, including one focused on workplace deaths in the oil and gas industries or a research project into how common hearing loss is in that industry.",
      "The HHS cuts eliminated the 17-member team responsible for the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, one of the main ways the government measures drug use.",
      "Also axed were the CDC staff working on the National Youth Tobacco Survey.",
      "There are other surveys that look at youth smoking and drug use, including the University of Michigan's federally funded \u201cMonitoring the Future\u201d survey of schoolkids.",
      "But the federal studies looked at both adults and adolescents, and provided insights into drug use by high school dropouts. The CDC also delved into specific vaping and tobacco products in the ways that other surveys don't, and was a driver in the federal push to better regulate electronic cigarettes.",
      "\"There was overlap among the surveys, but each one had its own specific focus that the other ones didn\u2019t cover,\u201c said Richard Miech, who leads the Michigan study.",
      "Work to modernize data collection has been derailed. That includes an upgrade to a 22-year-old system that helps local public health departments track diseases and allows CDC to put together a national picture.",
      "Another casualty was the Center for Forecasting and Outbreak Analytics, which tries to predict disease trends.",
      "The center, created during the COVID-19 pandemic, was working on forecasting the current multi-state measles outbreak. That forecast hasn't been published partly because of the layoffs, according to two CDC officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not authorized to discuss it and fear retribution for speaking to the press.",
      "Trump hasn't always supported widespread testing of health problems.",
      "In the spring of 2020, when COVID-19 diagnoses were exploding, the president groused that the nation\u2019s ability to do more testing was making the U.S. look like it had a worse problem than other countries. He called testing \u201ca double-edged sword.\u201d",
      "Mooney, the Johns Hopkins historian, wonders how interested the new administration is in reporting on health problems.",
      "\u201cYou could think it\u2019s deliberate,\" he said. \u201cIf you keep people from knowing, they\u2019re less likely to be concerned.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- The chief of Myanmar's military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, has for the first time since seizing power four years ago met with President Xi Jinping of China, a top ally of his military government, state-run media in the Southeast Asian nation reported Saturday.",
      "The Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper reported that Xi pledged to provide assistance for recovery after Myanmar\u2019s devastating earthquake in March and aid in efforts to end the country\u2019s civil war. The two leaders met Friday in Moscow on the sidelines of the commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II.",
      "Its report said they also discussed \u201cbilateral relations, enhancing cooperation in all sectors, and cooperating in regional stability and peace.\u201d",
      "China has been using its influence with ethnic rebel organizations to ease their pressure on the military government in an apparent effort to stabilize it.",
      "China, along with Russia, is a major arms supplier to Myanmar\u2019s military in its war against pro-democracy and ethnic minority resistance forces. Beijing is also Myanmar\u2019s biggest trading partner and has invested billions of dollars in mines, oil and gas pipelines, and other infrastructure. Its interests in security in Myanmar are especially strong because the two nations share an 890-mile (1,440-kilometer) border",
      "China\u2019s government has maintained good working relations with Myanmar\u2019s ruling military, which is shunned and sanctioned by many Western nations for the army's February 2021 takeover from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi and for major human rights violations.",
      "It is also one of the countries providing major relief and reconstruction assistance after the 7.7-magnitude March 28 earthquake that killed more than 3,700 people in Myanmar and injured more than 5,100.",
      "The quake worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis, with more than 3 million people displaced from their homes and nearly 20 million in need due to the war, according to the United Nations.",
      "Beijing has been concerned about instability that threatens its interests in Myanmar since Myanmar\u2019s army suffered unprecedented battlefield defeats over the past few years, especially in areas near the Chinese border.",
      "An offensive began in October 2023, by the \u201c Three Brotherhood Alliance, \u201d comprising the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the Arakan Army and the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army, was able to quickly capture towns and overrun military bases and command centers and strategic cities along the Chinese border in northeastern Shan state.",
      "It was widely seen at the time as having Beijing\u2019s tacit support to help stamp out rampant organized crime activities in areas controlled by ethnic Chinese.",
      "In early 2024, Beijing helped broker a ceasefire, but that quickly fell apart when the alliance launched new attacks. Myanmar\u2019s ruling generals and China\u2019s government showed concern as pro-democracy guerrillas and armed ethnic minority groups, sometimes working hand in hand, gained the initiative in fighting.",
      "The alliance\u2019s offensive lost momentum after China shut down border crossings, cut electricity to Myanmar towns and took other measures to discourage the fighting.",
      "Under increasing pressure from Beijing, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA, withdrew its forces and administration authorities last month from the strategically important town of Lashio in northeastern Myanmar, which hosts a major regional military headquarters but which the rebel group seized in August last year.",
      "A member of the MNDAA told The Associated Press on Saturday that the army's soldiers had already re-entered and and reestablished themselves in bases inside the town at the end of April. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to release information.",
      "Tar Pan La and Lway Yay Oo, spokespersons for the Ta\u2019ang National Liberation Army, or TNLA, said during an online press conference on May 4 that local residents had been facing difficulties as China and Myanmar\u2019s military government blocked trade into areas it controlled.",
      "Tar Pan La said China had continuously urged the group both in person and through messages to avoid clashes along the border and areas of Chinese investments.",
      "The TNLA said in a statement released on its Telegram channel on Saturday that the military carries out daily airstrikes in areas it controls, although it extended until the end of May a ceasefire it declared in the wake of the earthquake.",

      "GENEVA -- The U.S. treasury secretary and America\u2019s top trade negotiator will meet with high-ranking Chinese officials in Switzerland this weekend to de-escalate a dispute that threatens to cut off trade between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and to damage global commerce.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will meet in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng.",
      "Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 they\u2019ve slapped on each other\u2019s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries\u2019 boycotting each other\u2019s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \u201c 80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. And she doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\u201cThe best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\u201d she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \u201cIt cannot just be words.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10% tax on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump\u2019s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed the 145%.",
      "During Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2013 such as China\u2019s subsidies \u2013 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn\u2019t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Trump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\u201cAn increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland\u2019s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\u201d the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \u201cis therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- The bishop sat quietly near the front row, hands folded, listening as Indigenous leaders and church workers spoke about the threats to Peru\u2019s northern forests, a part of the Amazon rain forest. It was 2016, a year after Laudato Si, Pope Francis\u2019 encyclical on the environment.",
      "When he was up to speak, the bishop didn\u2019t preach though he was in his city of Chiclayo as host of a regional gathering. Instead, he reflected on things he had seen.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very important encyclical,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also represents something new in terms of this explicit expression of the church\u2019s concern for all of creation.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe had no problem saying yes when we proposed it \u2014 he was genuinely interested in social pastoral work.\u201d",
      "Since then, Prevost deepened his ties with interfaith environmental networks like the Interfaith Rainforest Initiative and Indigenous organizations such as AIDESEP, which place forest protection and rights at the center of Church concern.",
      "Such credentials have brought hope to clergymen and faithful in the Amazon region, a vast area with 48 million residents and 6.7 million square kilometers (2.6 million square miles) in South America. They see Chicago-born Prevost, who spent about two decades in Peru\u2019s countryside, as a pontiff who protect the region and fight against climate change.",
      "Many Catholics have said they believe Prevost\u2019s experience as bishop of Chiclayo, a city of 630,000 residents in Northern Peru and not too far from the Amazon, was one of the key reasons he was chosen. They also said the pontiff\u2019s hands-on experience in an impoverished area far from major cities could also serve him well in dealing with the Amazon and navigating its challenges.",
      "The Amazon is a key regulator of the climate, as its dense forests absorb carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that when released into the atmosphere heats the planet. But many parts of the Amazon are under threat from a wide range of illegal activities: farmers clearing trees to raise cows, gold miners dredging rivers and destroying local ecosystems and land-grabbers seizing territories. Wildfires and droughts, exacerbated by climate change, have also hit Amazon communities hard in recent years.",
      "Prevost is well acquainted with these issues, having presided over the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, which helped him bond with colleagues of the nine countries touched by the Amazon. Many of them are among the 105 bishops of an organization he openly supports, the Pan-Amazonian Ecclesial Network, a Catholic Church network focused on the Amazon region.",
      "\u201cI spoke to him a number times about the Amazon and the environment. He doesn\u2019t need to be convinced of its importance,\u201d said Cardinal Pedro Barreto, the president of the network, who has known Prevost since he became the bishop of Chiclayo in 2015.",
      "Brazilian Friar Paulo Xavier agrees.",
      "\u201cLeo will follow Francis; we are going forward with environment protection,\" Xavier said. \u201cThe Holy Spirit has acted on our behalf.\u201d",
      "Xavier is based in Manaus, a city of 2 million residents in the Amazon which received its first-ever cardinal appointed by Francis in 2022: the now 74-year-old archbishop Leonardo Steiner, an enthusiast of Laudato Si.",
      "Steiner, Xavier and the Manaus archdiocese have invested to get the encyclical into the hands of locals, even when that means jumping on small, motorized canoes through the brown waters of the Negro River to reach isolated villages in journeys that can last days on a boat.",
      "In November 2024, the Vatican News reported that Prevost called for more action to tackle climate change and protect the environment during a seminar in Rome. He cited efforts the Vatican has taken such as installing solar panels and electric vehicles.",
      "On the social media platform X, Prevost has reposted messages about protecting the environment. One message he reposted on April 1, 2017, expressed concern about emissions of carbon dioxide, a planet-warming gas, during President Donald Trump\u2019s his first term.",
      "Laura Vicu\u00f1a, an Indigenous woman of the Kariri people and the vice president of the Ecclesial Conference of the Amazon Region, said in a letter published on social media that she hopes the pope will be an ally in the fight against climate change. The conference was created by Francis in 2020 to promote discussion between clergymen and laypeople.",
      "\u201cFrom our dear Amazon, we plead with you to be our ally in the defense of what is the most sacred for us; life, land and rights,\u201d Vicu\u00f1a wrote.",
      "Indigenous peoples like Vicu\u00f1a\u2019s Kariri are often regarded as key protectors of the Amazon, but for many years they have been forced out of their lands by criminals, deforestation and famine, as seen in the Yanomami lands in Northern Brazil in 2023.",
      "Spaniard Luis Ventura, the executive-secretary of Brazil\u2019s Indigenous Missionary Council, said he prays for the new pope to keep his eyes close to the Amazon, with a special attention to the Indigenous. Founded in 1972, the council had rare occasions to meet with pontiffs until Francis rose in 2013. Its members hope Leo doesn\u2019t change that.",
      "\u201cLeo XIV will have a big impact on the Amazon,\" said Ventura. \u201cHis life was always with the people in Peru, and that allows us to think the church will be deep into the territory.\u201d",
      "Francis showed great interest in the Amazon during his pontificate. Four years after Laudato Si, he hosted the Amazon Synod, which sought \u201cnew Paths for the Church and for an integral ecology.\u201d",
      "Rose Bertoldo, one of the secretaries of the Manaus archdiocese, said she is hopeful for the region\u2019s future under Leo, given it would build on Francis\u2019 interest. She added the new pontiff will have a chance to visit Brazil, the nation with the most Catholics in the world, during this year\u2019s U.N. climate summit, known as COP30, in the Amazonian city of Belem in November.",
      "\u201cWe know that the urgencies and the challenges in the Amazon will be bigger because of the global political context of division. We need him at COP,\u201d Bertoldo said.",
      "Irish priest Peter Hughes, who spent most of his life in Peru, met Prevost shortly after he arrived in the Andean nation in 1985. They quickly became friends, and would see each other when the bishop of Chiclayo was in the capital Lima.",
      "\u201cBack then, (Prevost) was worried about extractivism in the Amazon and the effect it had on the poor,\" said Hughes, referring to the new pontiff. \u201cNow it is a much more complex world, the urgency is evident.\u201d",

The far-right outsider Calin Georgescu topped the first round following allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference, which Moscow has denied.",
      "The rally was held nearly a week after the first round of a presidential election redo that saw hard-right nationalist George Simion, 38, emerge as the front-runner. In second place was 55-year-old incumbent Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan.",
      "\u201cWe need to develop \u2026 we want to be like the best countries, and we don\u2019t have the possibilities on our own,\u201d said Stefan Gheorghe, a 23-year-old lawyer. \u201cYou need the European Union to help us out. It is very important to us to stay together \u2026 and to benefit from each other.\u201d",
      "A median of polls ahead of the runoff suggests Simion holds a lead in the vote, which will be held between the two staunchly antiestablishment candidates on May 18. Observers have warned that the outcome could reshape the EU and NATO member country\u2019s geopolitical direction.",
      "After reaching second place on Sunday night, Dan called the final vote a choice \u201cbetween a pro-Western direction for Romania and an anti-Western one.\u201d",
      "Simion\u2019s critics have long accused him of being Russia-friendly and warn that his presidency would undermine both the EU and NATO as Moscow\u2019s war drags on in Ukraine. But in an interview with The Associated Press this week, Simion rejected the accusations and said, \u201cIt\u2019s not for the good of the Romanian people to be close to Russia.\"",
      "\u201cWe want to be a member of the European Union. Some fake news were saying that we want to exit the European project,\u201d said Simion, who leads Romania's second-largest party, the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave. We are here to stay. We invested a lot.\u201d",
      "Simion, who came fourth in last year\u2019s race and later backed Georgescu, said in an earlier interview with the AP that he wants to see \"more power\" go to the bloc\u2019s 27 individual members, \u201cnot toward the European institutions.\u201d",
      "Similar rallies were held in several cities across Romania on Friday to mark Europe Day, a date that proclaims to celebrate peace and unity in Europe.",
      "Although Simion and Dan are ideological opposites, they both made their political careers railing against Romania\u2019s old political class, which has fallen out of favor as strong antiestablishment sentiment among voters grips the country.",
      "For Diana Draghici, 38, the upcoming runoff will be a pivotal moment for Romania\u2019s future and a choice between forging stronger EU ties or potentially shifting East.",

      "BERLIN -- Margot Friedl\u00e4nder, a German Jew who survived the Theresienstadt concentration camp and became a high-profile witness to Nazi persecution in her final years, has died. She was 103.",
      "Her death was announced by the Margot Friedl\u00e4nder Foundation in Berlin, German news agency dpa reported Friday evening.",
      "Details about when and where she died, as well as the cause of death, were not immediately available. The foundation did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment.",
      "She died the week of the 80th anniversary of Nazi Germany\u2019s unconditional surrender in World War II.",
      "After spending much of her life in the United States, Friedl\u00e4nder returned to live in the German capital in her 80s. She was honored with Germany\u2019s highest decoration and with a statue at Berlin\u2019s City Hall.",
      "\u201cWhat I do gives me my strength and probably also my energy, because I speak for those who can no longer speak,\u201d Friedl\u00e4nder said at an event at Berlin\u2019s Jewish Museum in 2018.",
      "\u201cI would like to say that I don\u2019t just speak for the 6 million Jews who were killed, but for all the people who were killed \u2014 innocent people,\u201d she said.",
      "German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier expressed his condolences in a statement, saying she gave Germany reconciliation despite the horrors she went through here in her life. Steinmeier said the country cannot be grateful enough for her gift.",
      "A report released last month said more than 200,000 Jewish survivors are still alive but 70% of them will be gone within the next 10 years.",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder was born Margot Bendheim on Nov. 5, 1921. Her father, Artur Bendheim, owned a shop in Berlin. He had fought for Germany and had been decorated in World War I.",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder recalled that, after the Nazis took power, her father initially said that \u201cthey don\u2019t mean us; We\u2019re Germans.\u201d She added that \u201cwe didn\u2019t see it until it was too late.\"",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder wanted to design clothes and started an apprenticeship as a tailor. After her parents divorced in 1937, Friedl\u00e4nder, her mother and younger brother went to live with her grandparents. In 1941, they had to move to a so-called \u201cJewish apartment,\u201d and Friedl\u00e4nder was forced to work nights at a metal factory.",
      "In January 1943, just as the family was planning to flee Berlin, Friedl\u00e4nder returned home to discover that her brother, Ralph, had been taken away by the Gestapo. A neighbor told her that her mother had decided to go to the police and \u201cgo with Ralph, wherever that may be.\u201d",
      "She passed on her mother\u2019s final message \u2014 \u201cTry to make your life,\u201d which would later become the title of Friedl\u00e4nder's autobiography \u2014 along with her handbag.",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder went into hiding, taking off the yellow star that Jews were obliged to wear. She recalled getting her hair dyed red, reasoning that \u201cpeople think Jews don\u2019t have red hair.\u201d",
      "She said that 16 people helped keep her under the radar over the next 15 months.",
      "That ended in April 1944 when she was taken in by police after being stopped for an identity check after leaving a bunker following an air raid. She said she quickly decided to tell the truth and say that she was Jewish.",
      "\u201cThe running and hiding was over,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt separated from the fate of my people. I had felt guilty every day; had I gone with my mother and my brother, I would at least have known what had happened to them.\u201d",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder arrived in June 1944 at the packed Theresienstadt camp. In the spring of 1945, she recalled later, she saw the arrival of skeletal prisoners who had been forced onto death marches from Auschwitz ahead of that camp\u2019s liberation.",
      "\u201cAt that moment, we heard of the death camps, and at that moment I understood that I would not see my mother and my brother again,\u201d she said. Both were killed at the Auschwitz death camp.",
      "Her father had fled in 1939 to Belgium. He later went to France, where he was interned, before being deported in 1942 to Auschwitz, where he was also killed.",
      "Shortly after the camp\u2019s liberation, she married Adolf Friedl\u00e4nder, an acquaintance from Berlin whom she met again at Theresienstadt. He had a sister in America, and \u2014 after months in a camp for displaced persons \u2014 they arrived in New York in 1946.",
      "Friedl\u00e4nder stayed away from Germany for 57 years. She and her husband became U.S. citizens; she worked as a tailor and later ran a travel agency.",
      "Adolf Friedl\u00e4nder died in 1997, aged 87. Margot returned to Germany for the first time in 2003, when she was received at Berlin\u2019s City Hall along with others who had been pushed out by the Nazis.",
      "In 2010, she moved back to the German capital, where she told her story to students and was decorated with, among other things, the country\u2019s highest honor, the Order of Merit. She was made a citizen of honor of Berlin in 2018.",
      "Noting that there were few Holocaust survivors still alive, she told an audience that year: \u201cI would like you to be the witnesses we can\u2019t be for much longer.\u201d",

      "A swimming coach in Nigeria's economic hub of Lagos is teaching disabled children how to swim through his nonprofit aimed at empowering them in life",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- About 20 children in shorts and vests gather at a swimming pool on a sweltering afternoon in Nigeria's economic hub of Lagos. A coach holds the hand of a boy who is blind as he demonstrates swimming motions and guides him through the pool while others take note.",
      "It was one of the sessions with students of the Pacelli School for the Blind and Partially Sighted, where Emeka Chuks Nnadi, the swimming coach, uses his Swim in 1 Day, or SID, nonprofit to teach swimming to disabled children.",
      "In a country where hundreds drown every year, often because of boat mishaps but sometimes as a result of domestic accidents, the initiative has so far taught at least 400 disabled people how to swim. It has also aided their personal development.",
      "\u201cIt (has) helped me a lot, especially in class,\u201d said 14-year-old Fikayo Adodo, one of Nnadi's trainees who is blind. \u201cI am very confident now to speak with a crowd, with people. My brain is sharper, like very great.\"",
      "The World Health Organization considers drowning as one of the leading causes of death through unintentional injury globally, with at least 300,000 people dying from drowning every year. The most at risk are young children.",
      "Many of the deaths occur in African countries like Nigeria, with limited resources and training to avert such deaths.",
      "In Nigeria \u2014 a country of more than 200 million people, 35 million of whom the government says are disabled \u2014 the challenge is far worse for disabled people who have less access to limited opportunities and resources in addition to societal stigma.",
      "While the initiative is raising awareness among the children about drowning, it benefits wider society in different ways, Nnadi said, especially \u201cif you want to have disabled people that are contributing to the economy and not just dependent on us as a society to take care of them.\u201d",
      "Nnadi recalled setting up the nonprofit after moving back to Nigeria from Spain in 2022 and seeing how disabled people are treated compared to others. It was a wide gap, he said, and thought that teaching them how to swim at a young age would be a great way to improve their lives.",
      "\u201cThere is a thing in Africa where parents are ashamed of their (disabled) kids,\u201d he said. \u201cSo (I am) trying to make people understand that your child that is blind could actually become a swimming superstar or a lawyer or doctor.\u201d",
      "\u201cI find it rewarding (watching) them transform right under my eyes,\u201d Nnadi said of the results of such lessons.",
      "Watching them take their lessons, some struggle to stay calm in the water and stroke their way through it, but Nnadi and the two volunteers working with him patiently guide them through the water, often leaving them excited to quickly try again.",
      "Some of them said that it gives them pleasure, while it is a lifesaving skill for some and it's therapy for others. Experts have also said that swimming can improve mental well-being, in addition to the physical benefits from exercising.",
      "\u201cSwimming (has) taught me to face my fears, it has (given) me boldness, it has given me courage, it has made me overcome my fears,\u201d said 13-year-old Ikenna Goodluck, who is blind and among Nnadi\u2019s trainees.",
      "Ejiro Justina Obinwanne said that the initiative has helped her son Chinedu become more determined in life.",

      "Switzerland\u2019s president has lamented \u201cdisappointing\u201d talks with U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s treasury secretary that did not ease stiff U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods",
      "GENEVA -- Switzerland's president lamented \u201cdisappointing\u201d talks Friday with U.S. President Donald Trump's treasury secretary that did not ease stiff U.S. tariffs on Swiss goods, but expressed hope for a solution to a more consequential U.S.-China face-off on tariffs in Geneva this weekend.",
      "Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter, who also serves as finance minister, said she was nonetheless encouraged by the talks with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as Switzerland tries to wriggle out of hefty 31% U.S. tariffs of Swiss goods as part of Trump's sweeping \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on countries around the globe.",
      "Their meeting was only an appetizer for the potentially market-moving talks Saturday and Sunday between Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Geneva. Keller-Sutter also met with the Chinese envoy, but said it was merely a courtesy.",
      "As for the U.S.-China talks, the Swiss leader alluded to the election of the first U.S.-born pontiff, Pope Leo XIV, and quipped: \"I said to Secretary Bessent that apparently the Holy Spirit was in Rome yesterday, and I hope that he will come to Geneva over the weekend.\u201d",
      "The talks have been shrouded in secrecy and the Chinese and U.S. sides have declined to specify where they will take place other than somewhere in Geneva, which hosted U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2021 \u2014 before Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "While the U.S. administration has temporarily suspended the most severe tariffs against every target country except China, the 31% rate \u2014 if restored \u2014 would put Switzerland in a worse position than its neighbors in the European Union, which are to face 20% U.S. tariffs on EU goods.",
      "The Swiss government said its talks Friday with Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer were \u201cconvivial and constructive\u201d and were aimed to lay out the guidelines for a deal on the issue of customs duties to be discussed again in coming weeks.",
      "On April 9 \u2014 a week after Trump announced the U.S. \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs \u2014 he spoke with Keller-Sutter by phone and later announced a pause in their implementation for 90 days and capped the additional U.S. tariffs at 10% for most countries, with the notable exception of China.",
      "\u201cOf course, it is disappointing,\" Keller-Sutter said when asked about the lack of a deal in talks with Bessent, before alluding to her earlier phone conversation with Trump. \u201cI also told President Trump that this was not fair. But on the other hand, you know, I mean, we\u2019re not looking back, we are looking forward.\u201d",
      "\"And we\u2019re really encouraged by the talks we had that we\u2019re going to find a solution, and the U.S. side really engaged with Switzerland also to find a swift solution,\u201d she told reporters.",
      "Keller-Sutter trumpeted Swiss investment in the United States, saying it has created 400,000 jobs and \u201caverage salary $130,000, which is a lot\u201d in the United States. She said she didn't know whether her call with Trump on April 9 convinced him to ease back on the tariffs, before adding with a laugh: \u201cHe should listen to women.\u201d",
      "Going into the weekend talks between Bessent and He, the U.S. slapped 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, and Beijing has responded with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. Earlier Friday, Trump floated the prospect that those could be lowered sharply in a social media post.",
      "\u201c80% Tariff on China seems right!\" Trump wrote on his social media account, before alluding to Bessent. \"Up to Scott B.\u201d",

      "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- International human rights organizations on Friday filed a lawsuit with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights asking that the commission order El Salvador\u2019s government to release Venezuelans deported from the United States and held in a maximum-security prison.",
      "In March, the U.S. government deported more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants alleged to have ties to the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador, paying the Salvadoran government to imprison them.",
      "Since then, they have had no access to lawyers or ability to communicate with their families. Neither the U.S. nor Salvadoran governments have said how the men could eventually regain their freedom.",
      "\u201cThese individuals have been stripped from their families and subject to a state-sponsored enforced disappearance regime, effectively, completely against the law,\u201d said Bella Mosselmans, director of the Global Strategic Litigation Council, which helped bring the suit. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping that this case might help put pressure on El Salvador to put basic guardrails in place.\u201d",
      "El Salvador has been living under a state of emergency for more than three years, which has suspended some fundamental rights and given the administration of President Nayib Bukele extraordinary powers. More than 85,000 Salvadorans have been arrested over the period for alleged ties to the country\u2019s once-powerful street gangs.",
      "The improvement in El Salvador\u2019s security has won Bukele widespread domestic support and some admirers in the region who seek to imitate his success. But the lack of due process and numerous arbitrary arrests have drawn international condemnation. Bukele has dismissed those critics as defenders of criminals.",
      "A spokesperson for Bukele's office declined to comment Friday.",
      "With the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump taking a hard line on immigration and portraying migrants broadly as criminals, neither government has been swayed by legal maneuvers in their own country to seek the men\u2019s release or return to the U.S.",
      "A judge in Washington this week said he would order the U.S. government to provide more information about its prison deal with El Salvador as he moved closer to requiring the government to return the men to the U.S.",
      "The human rights organizations hope that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights will accept this emergency petition. The commission is an arm of the regional Organization of American States. The groups presented the case on behalf of the families of 18 of the men sent to El Salvador, who provided sworn statements about their cases.",
      "Some of the men had pending asylum applications in the U.S., while others had been vetted and approved for refugee resettlement by the U.S. government, still others had temporary protected status allowing them to work in the U.S., according to the lawsuit.",
      "Bukele has said he has the room to hold the men and the payments from the U.S. will help cover the costs of his new prison.",
      "While both the Venezuelan government and nongovernmental organizations have filed habeas corpus petitions \u2014 essentially compelling the government to prove someone\u2019s detention was justified \u2014 in El Salvador\u2019s courts, none have advanced.",
      "The groups are asking the human right commission to order precautionary measures, basically an emergency action to prevent irreparable harm. Among them are the ability to communicate with their families, access to legal counsel and return to the United States. The commission would seek a response from El Salvador\u2019s government before making a decision, but is expected to move quickly.",
      "The other organizations involved in the lawsuit are the Boston University School of Law International Human Rights Clinic, the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies and Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights. __",

    "story": [
      "Two men have been convicted of cutting down the beloved Sycamore Gap tree in northern England along ancient Hadrian\u2019s Wall",
      "LONDON -- In late September 2023, as the first big storm of the fall was kicking up in the U.K., a malicious plan was hatched to take down one of England\u2019s favorite trees.",
      "Daniel Graham sent a message to his buddy, Adam Carruthers, telling him to \u201cget the saws warmed up,\u201d suggesting they might get some work clearing fallen trees.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t high winds that brought down the famous Sycamore Gap tree that night, jurors determined Friday. It was Graham and Carruthers \u2014 not cleaning up damage from the storm, but creating a mess of their own.",
      "The pair were convicted of two counts each of criminal damage by a jury in Newcastle Crown Court after little more than five hours of deliberations over two days.",
      "Even without the smoking chainsaw, prosecutors were able to prove the case through a trove of digital evidence that either put the men near the tree at the time it was felled or showed them excitedly discussing it the next day as the story of the tree\u2019s demise went viral.",
      "The prime piece of evidence was a grainy video on Graham\u2019s phone of the crime being committed on the dark and stormy night.",
      "Footage of the tree's last stand showed a solitary figure silhouetted beneath the towering canopy in a struggle with the trunk as the unmistakable sound of the chainsaw whined above the wind. With a single crack, the buzz of the saw died down, the person stepped back and the tree that had stood about 150 years crashed to earth.",
      "Metadata pinpointed the location of the video at the tree\u2019s location in Northumberland National Park. Other data showed Graham\u2019s Range Rover had traveled there.",
      "The Sycamore Gap tree was not Britain\u2019s biggest or oldest sycamore, but it was prized for its picturesque setting, symmetrically planted between two hills along the ancient wall built by Emperor Hadrian in A.D. 122 to protect the northwest frontier of the Roman Empire, and had attracted generations of followers.",
      "The tree had long been known to locals but received international attention in Kevin Costner\u2019s 1991 film \u201cRobin Hood: Prince Of Thieves.\u201d It drew tourists, lovers, landscape photographers and even those who spread the ashes of loved ones.",
      "\u201cFor over a century, Sycamore Gap has been an iconic natural landmark in the northeast of England, bringing immeasurable joy to those visiting the area,\" Gale Gilchrist, chief prosecutor for the region, said in a statement after the verdict. \u201cIn just under three minutes, Graham and Carruthers ended its historic legacy in a deliberate and mindless act of destruction.\u201d",
      "Neither Graham, who had a small construction business, nor Carruthers, a mechanic who sometimes worked with him, showed any visible reaction as the verdicts were read.",
      "Justice Christina Lambert ordered both men held in custody until sentencing on July 15 and said they could face \u201ca lengthy period in custody.\u201d The maximum sentence for criminal damage is 10 years in prison.",
      "The defendants, once close friends, both testified that they were at their respective homes that night and had nothing to do with the crime.",
      "Graham pointed the finger at Carruthers, saying he was obsessed with the tree. Graham said his friend and another man had taken his Range Rover and phone to the site to frame him.",
      "Carruthers said he didn't understand why people were so upset about \u201cjust a tree,\u201d saying it was \u201calmost as if someone had been murdered.\u201d His lawyer suggested Graham told a desperate lie after being caught.",
      "Prosecutor Richard Wright said the two men were in on it together from the start, with evidence showing Carruthers had gone far out of his way earlier in the day to go near the tree on a reconnaissance mission.",
      "Wright said he couldn\u2019t say who cut the tree and who held the phone, but the two men were the only people in the world with the video on their devices.",
      "As Graham\u2019s vehicle was tracked on its way back toward his home in Carlisle \u2014 about 40 minutes away \u2014 Carruthers received a video from his partner of their infant and replied, \u201cI\u2019ve got a better video than that,\u201d Wright said.",
      "\u201cAt the time of that text conversation, the only people in the world who knew the tree had been felled were the men who had had cut it down,\u201d Wright said. \u201cAnd the only people in the world who had access to the video were the men who had filmed themselves in the act of cutting down the tree: the defendants Graham and Carruthers.\u201d",
      "The next day, the two feverishly exchanged messages after the tree was discovered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s gone viral. It is worldwide,\u201d Graham said.",
      "Carruthers forwarded a Facebook comment by a man who criticized the \u201cdisgusting behavior\u201d of the \u201cweak\u201d vandals.",
      "Carruthers said he\u2019d like to see the man \u201claunch an operation like we did last night.\u201d",
      "Wright said police never located the chainsaw used to fell the tree, but each man had access to plenty of saws \u2014 a fact they both tried to downplay. Investigators also couldn't find a wedge of wood cut from the trunk to drop the tree in the right direction.",
      "But images on Graham\u2019s phone showed a slice of wood and a chainsaw in the back of his vehicle at his home. A forensic botanist said there was \u201cvery strong evidence\u201d it was the missing wedge that Wright suggested had been taken as a trophy.",
      "Prosecutors offered no evidence of a motive for the crime other than calling it senseless vandalism. But Wright suggested to jurors in his closing argument that the men cut the tree down for \u201ca bit of a laugh\u201d but had failed to realize the anger they would spark in the \u201carboreal equivalent of mindless thuggery.\u201d",
      "The tree was originally valued at more than 620,000 pounds (around $830,000) and damage to the wall was estimated at 1,100 pounds (nearly $1,500).",
      "But on Friday prosecutor Rebecca Brown said those figures are in dispute and are likely lower, but would still easily fit in the top category of harm for sentencing purposes.",

It was the first time in Ukraine's history that a Hungarian espionage operation had been discovered, the statement said.",
      "The activities of the suspected spies were focused on the western Ukraine region of Zakarpattia, which borders Hungary and is home to a sizeable Hungarian ethnic minority. Budapest and Kyiv have clashed over the rights of Hungarians in Zakarpattia, most of which was part of Hungary until the end of World War I.",
      "Hungarian Foreign Minister P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3 did not directly deny the allegations of a Hungarian espionage cell operating in Ukraine, but suggested that the SBU\u2019s claims could be classified as \u201canti-Hungarian propaganda.\u201d",

      "Hungary, a member of NATO and the European Union, has taken an adversarial approach to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, refusing to supply Kyiv with weaponry or to allow its transfer across Hungarian territory.",
      "The Hungarian government, led by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n, has also threatened to bloc EU financial assistance to Ukraine, argued against sanctions on Russia and opposed Ukraine's eventual membership in the EU.",
      "Orb\u00e1n is widely seen as having the warmest relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin among EU leaders, though he has acknowledged that the war was a result of Russian aggression.",
      "The SBU said both suspected spies were overseen by a career officer of Hungary\u2019s military intelligence, whose identity had also been established. That officer supplied the network with cash and a special device for covert communication to support the operation, and had attempted to recruit other individuals into the network, the SBU said.",

      "Addressing the crowd in Red Square, Putin praised Russian troops fighting in Ukraine, saying that \u201cwe are proud of their courage and determination, their spiritual force that always has brought us victory.\u201d",
      "Putin, who has ruled Russia for 25 years, has turned Victory Day into a key pillar of his tenure and has tried to use it to justify his action in Ukraine.",
      "For Putin, Victory Day celebrations have become \"a civic religion that boosts patriotism, nationalism, nostalgia, and justifies both his repressive regime at home and Russia\u2019s increasingly expansionist foreign policy abroad, particularly including towards its neighbors,\u201d Gabuev said.",
      "The parade featured over 11,500 troops and more than 180 military vehicles, including tanks, armored infantry vehicles and artillery used on the battlefield in Ukraine. As a reminder of Russia's nuclear might, huge Yars nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles launchers rolled across Red Square.",
      "Fighter jets of Russian air force's aerobatic teams flew by in close formation, followed by jets that trailed smoke in the colors of the national flag.",
      "Afterward, Putin shook hands with Russian generals who led the troops onto Red Square and spoke to medal-bedecked senior North Korean officers who watched the parade, hugging one of them.",
      "Last month, Putin thanked North Korea for fighting alongside Russian troops against Ukrainian forces and hailed their sacrifices as Pyongyang confirmed its deployment for the first time.",
      "The Russian and North Korean statements emphasized their expanding military partnership, especially after Russia said its troops have fully reclaimed the Kursk region that Ukrainian forces seized in a surprise incursion last year. Ukraine denied the claim.",
      "Victory Day festivities this year were overshadowed by Ukrainian drone attacks targeting Moscow and severe disruptions at the capital\u2019s airports. Aeroflot on Wednesday canceled more than 100 flights to and from Moscow, and delayed over 140 others as the military repelled Ukrainian drone attacks on the capital.",
      "Russian authorities tightened security ahead of the parade and cellphone internet outages were reported amid electronic countermeasures aimed at foiling more potential drone attacks.",
      "Putin had declared a unilateral 72-hour ceasefire starting May 7 to coincide with the Victory Day celebrations, but warned that Russian troops would retaliate to any attacks. Moscow has been reluctant to accept a U.S.-proposed 30-day truce that Ukraine has accepted, linking it to a halt in Western arms supplies to Ukraine and Kyiv\u2019s mobilization effort, conditions Ukraine and its Western allies have rejected.",
      "Ukrainian authorities reported scores of Russian strikes Friday that killed at least two people in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions and damaged buildings. A Russian drone also struck a civilian vehicle in Zaporizhzhia, critically injuring a man and also wounding his wife.",
      "As the parade and other festivities unfolded in Moscow, dozens of European officials met in Lviv, in western Ukraine, to endorse the creation of a special tribunal to prosecute Russian officials accused of war crimes.",
      "\u201cRussia needs to feel our common and, most importantly, growing strength,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, addressing the Lviv meeting.

      "\u201cI\u2019m sure that this tribunal will allow for the fight against impunity against all war crimes that have been committed during this war of aggression of Russia against Ukraine,\u201d said French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot.",

      "BANGKOK -- Thailand\u2019s King Maha Vajiralongkorn presided Friday over an elaborate annual ceremony that marks the start of the rice-planting season and honors the nation's farmers.",
      "The Royal Ploughing Ceremony is held to read auguries that predict the farming conditions for the year ahead. As is usually the case, good times were predicted, even though Thailand's economy is sluggish.",
      "The King and Queen Suthida were sheltered from the bright sun by ornate umbrellas at the ceremony\u2019s traditional venue, Sanam Luang, or \u201cRoyal Ground,\u201d a large field near the Grand Palace in the capital Bangkok.",
      "According to Thai historians, the ritual goes back some 700 years. Then, as now, the cultivation of rice was central to the country\u2019s culture and economy, and the ceremony is meant to give encouragement to farmers as the new planting season begins.",
      "The ceremony was led by the highest-ranking civil servant in the Agriculture Ministry, serving as the Lord of the Ploughing Ceremony. In a colorful traditional costume, he chose from a selection of cloths, and the one he picked was interpreted to signify satisfactory rainfall and an abundant harvest.",
      "In the ceremony\u2019s second stage, he anointed the heads of two \u201csacred\u201d oxen, who then pulled a plough around a section of the field several times, as he scattered seeds at the front of a small procession with more traditionally garbed participants.",
      "The two oxen, called \u201cPor\u201d and \u201cPiang\u201d \u2014 which together mean \u201csufficiency\u201d \u2014 then chose from a selection of food offered by Brahmin priests. The foods chosen were water, grass and liquor, which symbolize adequate water supplies, abundance of food supplies and what was interpreted as good international trade, respectively.",
      "After the departure of the king and queen, onlookers sprinted onto the field to collect the scattered seeds as souvenirs or to add to their own rice stores at home for a meritorious mix.",

    "story": [
      "Vaccination teams are part of an effort by health authorities across Mexico to contain the country\u2019s biggest measles outbreak in decades",
      "CUAUHTEMOC, Mexico -- In a rickety white Nissan, nurse Sandra Aguirre and her vaccination team drive past apple orchards and cornfields stretching to the desert horizon. Aguirre goes door to door with a cooler of measles vaccines. In one of Latin America's biggest Mennonite communities, she knows many will decline to be vaccinated or even open their doors. But some will ask questions, and a handful might even agree to get shots on the spot.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re out here every single day,\u201d said Aguirre, pausing to call out to an empty farm, checking for residents. \u201cTo gain trust of the Mennonites \u2013 because they\u2019re reserved and closed-off people \u2013 you have to meet them where they\u2019re at, show a friendly face.\u201d",
      "Aguirre's work is part of an effort by health authorities across the country to contain Mexico's biggest measles outbreak in decades, as cases climb not only here but in the U.S. and Canada. In Mexico, cases have been concentrated in the Mennonite community \u2014 long skeptical of vaccines and distrustful of authorities \u2014 in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Officials say results of their campaign alongside Mennonite leaders have been mixed \u2014 they cite tens of thousands of new vaccinations in Chihuahua, but infections have ballooned and spread past the community to Indigenous and other populations.",
      "Federal officials have documented 922 cases and one death in Chihuahua. Officials, health workers and local leaders say the numbers are likely underestimated, and misinformation about vaccines and endemic distrust of authorities are their biggest obstacles.",
      "Pressed against the fringes of the small northern city of Cuauhtemoc, the Mennonite settlement here spans about 40 kilometers (25 miles). With 23,000 residents, it's one of Cuauhtemoc's primary economic engines, but it's an isolated place where families keep to themselves. Some have turned to social media and anti-vaccine websites for research. Others use little technology but visit family in the United States, where they also hear misinformation \u2014 which then spreads through word of mouth.",
      "Chihuahua is a particularly worrisome place, officials say \u2014 as a border state, the risk that the preventable disease will continue spreading internationally and affect the most vulnerable is high.",
      "\u201cWe have a massive flow of people,\u201d said Alexis Hern\u00e1ndez, a Cuauhtemoc health official. \u201cThat makes things a lot more complicated.\u201d",
      "Mexico considered measles eliminated in 1998. But its vaccination rate against the virus was around 76% as of 2023, according to the World Health Organization \u2014 a dip from previous years and well below the 95% rate experts say is needed to prevent outbreaks.",
      "Mexico\u2019s current outbreak began in March. Officials traced it to an 8-year-old unvaccinated Mennonite boy who visited relatives in Seminole, Texas \u2014 at the center of the U.S. outbreak.",
      "Cases rapidly spread through Chihuahua's 46,000-strong Mennonite community via schools and churches, according to religious and health leaders. From there, they said, it spread to workers in orchards and cheese plants.",
      "Gloria Elizabeth Vega, an Indigenous Raramuri woman and single mother, fell sick in March. Because she's vaccinated, measles didn't occur to her until she broke out in hives. Her supervisor at the cheese factory \u2014 who also caught measles \u2014 told her she had to take 10 days of leave and docked her pay 40% for the week, Vega said.",
      "It's rare for vaccinated people to get measles, but officials say that may account for up to 10% of cases here, though they're milder.",
      "Vega tucked herself away in the back of her two-room home, hoping her daughter and mother \u2014 also vaccinated \u2014 wouldn\u2019t get sick. She wishes people would think of others when considering vaccination.",
      "\u201cThey say, \u2018Well, I have enough to be fine,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBut they don\u2019t think about that other person next to them, or wonder if that person has enough to live off of.\u201d",
      "Vaccination isn't required in Mexico. Schools can request vaccination records, federal health department spokesman Carlos Mateos said, but they cannot deny anyone access to education.",
      "In Chihuahua, some schools started reaching out to parents for copies of vaccination cards and encouraging shots, said Rodolfo Cort\u00e9s, state health ministry spokesman.",
      "It's unknown how many in the Mennonite community have gotten the vaccine \u2014 which is safe, with risks lower than those of measles complications.",
      "Gabriella Villegas, head of vaccination at a clinic treating Mennonites with measles, estimated 70% of community members are not vaccinated. Other health authorities estimated the vaccination rate around 50%.",
      "Mennonites who spoke to The Associated Press \u2014 most on condition of anonymity, fearing backlash \u2014 repeatedly cited vaccine misinformation. One man said U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a long record of promoting anti-vaccine views and has called vaccination a personal choice, is a hero.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t accept vaccines; it\u2019s that easy. Because that\u2019s where freedom of expression comes in,\u201d said the man, Jacob Goertzen. \"If we can\u2019t make out own decisions, we don\u2019t live in a democracy.\u201d",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez, Cuauhtemoc\u2019s health director, said outside influences affect community vaccine views.",
      "\u201cThe Mennonite population has a lot of access to social media and family members in the U.S. and Canada, where there are a lot of myths that have taken hold and many more \u2018anti-vaccine\u2019 groups than we have in Mexico,\u201d he said.",
      "During nurse Aguirre's vaccination drive, one man simply said people here \u201cprefer to cure themselves in their own way.\" A mother described getting sick with measles as a \"privilege\" and spoke of putting her unvaccinated 5- and 7-year-olds in a party so everyone could get sick and recover \u2014 a risky tactic doctors have long denounced.",
      "Mexico's lone death from measles was a 31-year-old Mennonite man in the settlement who had diabetes and high blood pressure, underlying conditions that often complicate sicknesses.",
      "Most people in Indigenous and other communities quickly agreed to vaccinate, officials told AP, but in Mennonite areas crews have to do more vigorous outreach \u2014 the door-to-door visits, follow-up calls and conversations, and involvement of local leaders.",
      "In Cuauhtemoc's settlement, that's leaders like Jacob Dyck Penner. As colony president, he and other leaders closed school for two weeks to slow infections, have made a push to show residents they\u2019re working with health authorities, and are encouraging vaccination.",
      "Leaders translate health information into Low German, the native language of most of the community. Penner and others are assisting vaccination teams, making sure families know how to access health services.",
      "\u201cWe had to find this way, together with doctors, to not pressure people or inspire distrust, so they can take their time and make their own decision to accept (being vaccinated),\u201d Penner said.",
      "Medics report more people visiting clinics, seeking vaccines for measles and other diseases. Still, Penner said, there a swath of people will always reject vaccinations.",
      "Health officials like Hern\u00e1ndez say they're concerned in particular for vulnerable populations including Indigenous groups, many of whom have fewer resources to cope.",
      "Vega, the single mother who got measles, said her job at the cheese factory was once a blessing, providing health insurance and steady pay.",
      "But the forced leave and docked pay left her reeling. She said she's living paycheck to paycheck and wonders how she'll pay the bills \u2014 her daughter's school supplies, lunches, tennis shoes.",
      "\u201cI have a daughter to keep afloat,\" she said. \"It\u2019s not like I have the option to wait and pay for things, for food.\u201d",

    "summary": "A female business owner in Uganda wanted to create a coffee sisterhood",
    "story": [
      "A female business owner in Uganda wanted to create a coffee sisterhood",
      "SIRONKO, Uganda -- Meridah Nandudu envisioned a coffee sisterhood in Uganda, and the strategy for expanding it was simple: Pay a higher price per kilogram when a female grower took the beans to a collection point.",
      "It worked. More and more men who typically made the deliveries allowed their wives to go instead.",
      "Nandudu\u2019s business group now includes more than 600 women, up from dozens in 2022. That\u2019s about 75% of her Bayaaya Specialty Coffee\u2019s pool of registered farmers in this mountainous area of eastern Uganda that produces prized arabica beans and sells to exporters.",
      "\u201cWomen have been so discouraged by coffee in a way that, when you look at (the) coffee value chain, women do the donkey work,\u201d Nandudu said. But when the coffee is ready for selling, men step in to claim the proceeds.",
      "Her goal is to reverse that trend in a community where coffee production is not possible without women's labor.",
      "Uganda is one of Africa\u2019s top two coffee producers, and the crop is its leading export. The east African country exported more than 6 million bags of coffee between September 2023 and August 2024, accounting for $1.3 billion in earnings, according to the Uganda Coffee Development Authority.",
      "The earnings have been rising as production dwindles in Brazil, the world\u2019s top coffee producer, which faces unfavorable drought conditions.",
      "In Sironko district, where Nandudu grew up in a remote village near the Kenya border, coffee is the community's lifeblood. As a girl, when she was not at school, she helped her mother and other women look after acres of coffee plants. They usually planted, weeded and toiled with the post-harvest routine that includes pulping, fermenting, washing and drying the coffee.",
      "The harvest season was known to coincide with a surge in cases of domestic violence, she said. Couples fought over how much of the earnings that men brought home from sales \u2014 and how much they didn't.",
      "\u201cWhen (men) go and sell, they are not accountable. Our mothers cannot ask, \u2018We don\u2019t have food at home. You sold coffee. Can you pay school fees for this child?\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Years later, Nandudu earned her degree in the social sciences from Uganda\u2019s top public university in 2015, with her father funding her education from coffee earnings. She had the idea to launch a company that would prioritize the needs of coffee-producing women in the country's conservative society.",
      "She thought of her project as a kind of sisterhood and chose \u201cbayaaya\" \u2014 a translation in the Lumasaba language \u2014 for her company's name.",
      "It launched in 2018, operating like others that buy coffee directly from farmers and process it for export.",
      "But Bayaaya is unique in Mbale, the largest city in eastern Uganda, for focusing on women and for initiatives such as a cooperative saving society that members can contribute to and borrow from.",
      "For small-holder Ugandan farmers in remote areas, a small movement in the price of a kilogram of coffee is a major event. The decision to sell to one or another middleman often hinges on small price differences.",
      "A decade ago, the price of coffee bought by a middleman from a Ugandan farmer was roughly 8,000 Uganda shillings, or just over $2 at today\u2019s exchange rate. Now the price is roughly $5.",
      "Nandudu adds an extra 200 shillings to the price of every kilogram she buys from a woman. It\u2019s enough of an incentive that more women are joining. Another benefit is a small bonus payment during the off-season from February to August.",
      "That motivates many local men \u201cto trust their women to sell coffee,\u201d Nandudu said. \u201cWhen a woman sells coffee, she has a hand in it.\u201d",
      "Nandudu\u2019s group has many collection points across eastern Uganda, and women trek to them at least twice a week. Men are not turned away.",
      "Selling as a Bayaaya member has fostered teamwork as her family collectively decides how to spend coffee earnings, said Linet Gimono, who joined the group in 2022.",
      "And with assured earnings, she\u2019s able to afford the \"small things\u201d she often needs as a woman. \u201cI can buy soap (and) I can buy sugar without pulling ropes with my husband over it,\u201d she said.",
      "Another member, Juliet Kwaga, said her mother never would have thought of collecting coffee earnings because her father was very much in charge.",
      "Now, Kwaga's husband, with a bit of encouragement, is comfortable sending her. \u201cAt the end of the day I go home with something to feed my family, to support my children,\" she said.",
      "In Sironko district, home to more than 200,000 people, coffee trees dot the hilly terrain. Much of the farming is on plots of one or two acres, although some families have larger tracts.",
      "Many farmers don\u2019t usually drink coffee, and some have never tasted it. Some women smiled in embarrassment when asked what it tasted like.",
      "But things are slowly changing. Routine coffee drinkers are emerging among younger women in the coffee business in urban areas, including at a roasting place in Mbale where most employees are women.",
      "Phoebe Nabutale, who helps oversee quality assurance for Darling Coffee, was raised in a family of coffee growers. She bent over the roaster, smelling the beans until she got the aroma she wanted.",
      "Many of her girlfriends, she said, regularly ask how they can break into the coffee business, as roasters or otherwise.",
      "For Nandudu, who aims to start exporting beans, that's progress.",
      "Now there are more women in \u201ccoffee as a business,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "The Norwegian company Equinor says it will be forced to terminate an offshore wind project for New York within days unless the Trump administration lets construction resume",
      "The Norwegian energy company Equinor said Friday it will be forced to terminate an offshore wind project for New York within days unless President Donald Trump 's administration relents on its order that stopped construction.",
      "Work on Empire Wind has been paused since April 16, when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum directed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management to halt construction. Burgum said it needs further review because it appeared the Biden administration rushed the approval. Equinor went through a seven-year permitting process before starting to build Empire Wind last year, and the project is roughly a third complete.",
      "Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and has signed a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. His first day in office, Trump signed an executive order temporarily halting offshore wind lease sales in federal waters and pausing the issuance of approvals, permits and loans for all wind projects.",
      "Empire Wind is fully permitted and the developer has already invested more than $2.5 billion so far in the project, said Molly Morris, president of Equinor Renewables Americas, in an interview Friday.",
      "She said this is an \u201curgent, unsustainable situation\u201d because each day of uncertainty is extremely expensive: Equinor spends up to $50 million per week on the project and has 11 vessels on standby. The developer has done a significant amount of onshore work already, where the cable from the wind farm will connect to the local grid.",
      "\u201cIf no material progress is made toward a resolution within days, Equinor will be forced to terminate the project,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is about honoring contracts and financial investments made in the U.S. It could set a dangerous precedent by stopping a project in mid-execution.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.",
      "Equinor has over $60 billion in investments across the U.S., including substantial oil, gas and renewable projects. RWE, a German energy company, has stopped its offshore wind work in the United States, citing the political environment. French energy giant TotalEnergies paused the development of its offshore wind project in New York after Trump won reelection.",
      "Equinor is considering legal options, but rather than getting tied up in the courts, Morris said the best way forward is a quicker political resolution. The summer construction window for major offshore work began this month, and missing it would set the project back a year, she said.",
      "Morris and Equinor CEO Anders Opedal met with Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, on Wednesday. She said it was helpful, but they've asked to meet with Burgum and haven't gotten a meeting.",
      "Equinor is building Empire Wind to start providing power in 2026 for more than 500,000 New York homes. Equinor finalized the federal lease for Empire Wind in March 2017, early in Trump\u2019s first term. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management approved the construction and operations plan in February 2024 and construction began that year.",
      "New York is leading a coalition of state attorneys general challenging the wind energy executive order in court. They say in the lawsuit filed Monday that Trump doesn\u2019t have the authority to unilaterally shut down the permitting process, and he\u2019s jeopardizing development of a power source critical to the states\u2019 economic vitality, energy mix, public health and climate goals.",
      "The White House says Democratic attorneys general are trying to stop the president\u2019s popular energy agenda instead of working with him to restore America\u2019s energy dominance.",

      "Airbnb and Hilton noted the same trends last week in their quarterly earnings reports. Most major U.S. airlines pulled their full-year financial guidance in April and said they planned to reduce scheduled flights, citing an ebb in economy passengers booking leisure trips.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association has said that economic uncertainty and anxiety over President Donald Trump's tariffs may explain the pullback. In April, Americans\u2019 confidence in the economy slumped for a fifth straight month to the lowest level since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Abroad, anger about the tariffs as well as concern about tourist detentions at the U.S. border have made citizens of some other countries less interested in traveling to the U.S., tourism industry experts say.",

      "The numbers did not include land crossings from Mexico or travel from Canada, where citizens have expressed indignation over Trump's remarks about making their country the 51st state. Both U.S. and Canadian government data have shown steep declines in border crossings from Canada.",
      "Expedia Chief Financial Officer Scott Schenkel said the net value of the travel technology company's bookings into the U.S. fell 7% in the January-March period, but bookings to the U.S. from Canada were down nearly 30%.",
      "In a conference call with investors Friday, Expedia CEO Ariane Gorin said U.S. demand was even softer in April than March.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still continuing to see pressure on travel into the U.S., but we\u2019ve also seen some rebalancing,\u201d Gorin said. \u201cEuropeans are traveling less to the U.S., but more to Latin America.\u201d",
      "Seattle-based Expedia said its revenue rose 3% to $2.99 billion for the quarter. That was lower than the $3 billion Wall Street was expecting, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",

      "Airbnb said last week that foreign travel to the U.S. makes up only 2% to 3% of its business. But within that category, it's seeing declining interest in the U.S. as a destination.",
      "\u201cI think Canada is the most obvious example, where we see Canadians are traveling at a much lower rate to the U.S. but they\u2019re traveling more domestically, they are traveling to Mexico, they are going to Brazil, they\u2019re going to France, they\u2019re going to Japan,\u201d Airbnb Chief Financial Officer Ellie Mertz said in a conference call with investors.",
      "Meanwhile, Hilton lowered its full-year forecast for revenue per available room, a key industry metric. The company said in late April that it now expects growth of 0% to 2% for the year, down from 2% to 3%.",
      "Hilton President and CEO Christopher Nassetta told stock analysts the company saw international travel to its U.S. hotels fall throughout the first quarter, particularly from Canada and Mexico.",

      "Toy dolls have become the latest rhetorical poster child for President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade has taken aim at a number of foreign goods, from European wines and car parts from Mexico to films made abroad. Lately, the president's wandering ire has found another rhetorical poster child: toy dolls.",
      "Trump asserted that children will be fine having two dolls \u2014 perhaps three or five \u2014 instead of 30 if U.S. import taxes increase consumer prices. The response on social media included memes of him portrayed as the Grinch and photos of a young Barron Trump\u2019s child-sized Mercedes convertible.",
      "\u201cCOMPLETELY out of touch,\" The Loyal Subjects CEO Jonathan Cathey, whose collectible toy company in Los Angeles produces Strawberry Shortcake and Rainbow Brite dolls, wrote on Linkedin. \"If that ain\u2019t a \u2018Let them eat cake\u2019 moment shot through the echoes of history? Love how toys and dolls have become THE martyr metaphor for this nonsensical trade war incoherence.\u201d",
      "The president's comments also touched a nerve with parents, both ones who took offense at the casual way he hypothesized that perhaps \u201ctwo dolls will cost a couple bucks more\u201d and those who acknowledged their own kids have more toys than they need.",
      "Either way, the U.S. toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the tariff standoff between the Trump administration and the government in Beijing. Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. come from China.",
      "The Toy Association, a trade group, has lobbied for an immediate reprieve from the 145% tariff rate the president put on Chinese-made products. Some toy companies warn the likelihood of holiday shortages increases each week the tariff remains in effect.",
      "Here's a snapshot of the doll debate and how tariffs are impacting toys:",
      "From Barbie, Bratz and Cabbage Patch Kids to Adora baby dolls, American Girl and Our Generation, dolls are a big business in the U.S. as well as beloved playthings.",
      "The doll category, which includes accessories like clothes, generated U.S. sales of $2.7 billion last year compared to $2.9 billion in 2023 and $3.4 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Circana.",
      "Consumers splurged on toys during the height of the COVID pandemic to keep children and themselves occupied, but sales flattened as inflation seized the economy.",
      "Younger girls becoming more interested in buying makeup and skincare also has cooled the demand for dolls, Marshal Cohen, Circana's chief retail advisor, said.",
      "The nation's largest toy maker, Mattel, said this week it would have to raise prices for some products sold in the U.S. to offset higher costs related to tariffs.",
      "The company, whose brands include Barbie and American Girl, said the increases were necessary even though it\u2019s speeding up the expansion of its manufacturing base outside of China.",
      "Smaller toy companies are expected to have a harder time than Mattel and Hasbro, which makes the eating, drinking and diaper-wetting Baby Alive. Cathey said he paused The Loyal Subjects' shipments from China in April because he couldn't pay the stratospheric tariff they would have incurred.",
      "\u201cNobody insulates themselves with that much cash,\u201d he said.",
      "With about four months' worth of inventory on hand, Cathey said his ability to secure holiday stock depends on a break in the U.S.-China trade standoff happening in the next two weeks since it would take time for cargo operations to resume.",
      "Cepia, a Missouri company that was behind the 2009 holiday season hit Zhu Zhu Pets, launched a line of 11-inch fashion dolls called Decora Girlz last year. CEO James Russell Hornsby said he was working to relocate some production but the move won't happen in time to replace the orders he planned to get from China.",
      "Hornsby described himself as a Trump supporter and said he understands the administration's desire to reduce trade imbalances.",
      "\u201cLet's just get the deals done and stop all this because (Trump's) disrupting Christmas,\u201d he said.",
      "Although American Girl launched in 1986 with a line based on fictional historical characters, the dolls never were domestic products. They were made in Germany before production eventually moved to China.",
      "Toy experts say that in addition to lower costs, Chinese factories have developed techniques and expertise that are not easily replicated.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any capacity in the U.S. to make rooted doll hair. And then you\u2019ve got things like the faces. Some of them are hand-painted, others are done with a Tampo (printing) machine,\u201d James Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry publication The Toy Book, said of doll-making.",
      "Hornsby said rooting the synthetic hair onto the heads of Decora Girlz dolls is carried out by skilled workers at factories in Guangzhou and Dongguan, China.",
      "\u201cIt's not just sticking into a machine and it automatically does it,\" he said. \u201dYou have to know what you\u2019re doing in order to make that doll look like it\u2019s got a full set of hair when literally maybe only 60% of the head is filled with hair.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said last week that he assumes consumers would prefer to pay more for American-made products. Dolls made in China might have lead paint in them, he said.",
      "Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said the picture is more complicated.",
      "Products for children ages 12 and under require third-party testing and certification from labs approved by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing lead levels in toys, Murray said.",
      "The rules apply to all products sold in the U.S. Toys by major brands such as Fisher-Price, Mattel, Hasbro and Lego, which have long outsourced manufacturing to China, are usually in compliance, she said.",
      "But the rise of online shopping, including e-commerce platforms that ship directly to U.S. consumers from overseas, has posed a challenge, according to Murray. When valued at less than $800, such parcels entered the U.S. duty-free and were not subject to the same scrutiny as bulk imports, she said.",
      "The White House eliminated the customs exemption starting May 2 for low-value parcels that originated in mainland China and Hong Kong. U.S Customs and Border Protection expects additional oversight will make it easier to flag problems.",
      "Toy companies and industry experts argue the high tariffs on Chinese imports will tempt price-sensitive shoppers to search for cheap counterfeit toys that carry higher safety risks.",
      "Plenty of people agree American consumer culture has gotten out of hand, in large part due to prices kept low through the labor of foreign factory workers who earn much less than they would in the U.S.",
      "Katie Walley-Wiegert, 38, a senior marketer in Richmond, Virginia, and the parent of a 2-year-old son, agrees there\u2019s too much materialism but thinks parents should have choices when deciding what is best for their children. She found the wealthy Trump\u2019s comments off-putting.",
      "\u201cI think it is a small view of what purchase habits and realities are for people who buy toys for kids,\u201d Walley-Wiegert said.",
      "San Francisco resident Elenor Mak, who founded the Jilly Bing doll company after she couldn't find an Asian American doll for her daughter, Jillian, now 5, said the president's remarks upset her because some families struggle to buy even one doll.",
      "The trade war with China \u201cjust makes it even more impossible for those families,\u201d Mak said.",

      "The air traffic controllers directing planes into the Newark, New Jersey, airport lost their radar Friday morning for the second time in two weeks",
      "The air traffic controllers directing planes into the Newark, New Jersey, airport briefly lost their radar Friday morning for the second time in two weeks, renewing concerns about the nation's aging air traffic control system that President Donald Trump wants to overhaul.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said the radar at the facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark airport went black for 90 seconds at 3:55 a.m. Friday. That\u2019s similar to what happened on April 28.",
      "That first radar outage led to hundreds of flights being canceled or delayed at the Newark airport in the past two weeks after the FAA slowed down traffic at the airport to ensure safety. Five controllers also went on trauma leave after that outage, worsening the existing shortage. It\u2019s not clear if any additional controllers will go on leave now.",
      "The number of cancellations and delays spiked after the FAA limited traffic at Newark and has remained high since then. The FAA plans to talk with all the airlines that fly out of Newark about cutting their schedules while the staffing and technology issues persist.",
      "The number of cancellations Friday morning was down around 40 departures and arrivals, but increased after the radar outage and a disruption related to ongoing runway construction. By the end of the day 68 departures and arrivals had been canceled in Newark, and more than 400 delays were reported.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Friday that the \u201cglitch this morning at Newark\u201d was caused by the same issues as last week.",
      "The latest Newark problems reinforce the need for the multi-billion-dollar plan Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced Thursday to replace the nation\u2019s aging air traffic control system, Leavitt said. The plan is designed to prevent such problems from happening and give controllers modern technology. More than 4,600 new high-speed connections would be installed and 618 radars would be replaced across the country.",
      "Officials developed the plan to upgrade the system after a deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and an Army helicopter killed 67 people in the skies over Washington, D.C. Several other crashes this year also put pressure on officials to act.",
      "But the shortcomings of the air traffic control system have been known for decades. The National Transportation Safety Board has not determined that a problem with the air traffic control system caused that crash near Reagan National Airport.",
      "These radar outages in such a crowded airspace are alarming because seconds matter, but Allied Pilots Association spokesman Capt. Dennis Tajer said \u201cit\u2019s not an impending disaster that some are suggesting.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe system is wired to run really well when everything\u2019s functioning. But the most important part is that it\u2019s prepared to function when things go wrong,\u201d Tajer said. \u201cEven when it sounds frightening, know that the air traffic controllers and the pilots have training and we go to that.\u201d",
      "When pilots lose contact with controllers their first action is to continue on their last-directed path, but if the outage continues, pilots will start broadcasting their position to every other plane in the area \u2014 much like pilots do at small airports that don\u2019t have a control tower.",
      "U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer blamed the problems that have plagued Newark on the lack of proper air traffic controller staffing and modern technology. He said at a news conference Friday that there are currently about 20 controllers working, and that number should be in the 60s. And many of the lines connecting controllers to the radar are outdated copper wires. He said the April 28 outage was caused by one of those copper wires getting fried.",
      "\u201cOur region is a key economic artery for our country. Yet this region... one of the busiest air spaces in the world, as I mentioned, is running off a tower that\u2019s full of copper wire dating back to the 1980s with outdated and inefficient technology. And the region is short \u2014 and this is a big deal. The region is short about 40 air traffic controllers,\u201d Gottheimer said. He said the tower was built back in \u201cthe Brady Bunch era\u201d in 1973.",
      "The FAA said earlier this week that it is installing new fiber optic data lines to carry the radar signal between its facilities in Philadelphia and New York. Officials said some of the lines connecting those two facilities are outdated copper wire that will be replaced. But it's not clear how quickly those repairs can be completed.",
      "U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said it's important that the FAA get the problems affecting the Newark airport fixed quickly.",
      "\u201cEnough is enough. The connection between New York air space and the Philadelphia air traffic control center must be fixed now. The backup system that is not working must be fixed. Now,\" Schumer said. \"This is an air travel safety emergency that requires immediate and decisive action, not a promise of a big, beautiful unfunded overhaul that will take years to begin to implement.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The way President Donald Trump sees it, beating China in a trade war should be easy.",
      "After all, his logic goes, the Chinese sell Americans three times as much stuff as Americans sell them. Therefore, they have more to lose. Inflict enough pain, like the combined 145% taxes he slapped on Chinese imports last month, and they\u2019ll beg for mercy.",
      "Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Scott Bessent has confidently compared Beijing to a card player stuck with a losing hand. \u201cThey\u2019re playing with a pair of twos,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Somebody forgot to tell China. So far, the Chinese have refused to fold under the pressure of Trump\u2019s massive tariffs. Instead, they have retaliated with triple-digit tariffs of their own.",
      "\u201cAll bullies are just paper tigers,\u2019\u2019 the Chinese Foreign Ministry declared in a video last week. \u201cKneeling only invites more bullying.\u2019\u2019",
      "The stakes are high between the world\u2019s two biggest economies whose trade topped $660 billion last year. Bessent and Trump\u2019s top trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, are heading to Geneva this weekend for initial trade talks with top Chinese officials. Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \u201c80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "While businesses and investors welcome any easing of tensions, the prospects for a quick and significant breakthrough appear dim.",
      "\u201cThese are talks about talks, and China may be coming to assess what\u2019s on the table \u2014 or even just to buy time,\u201d said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cThere\u2019s no shared roadmap or clear pathway to de-escalation.\u201d",
      "But if the two countries eventually agree to scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they have slapped on each other\u2019s goods, it would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "\u201cThe companies involved in this trade on both sides just cannot afford waiting anymore,\u201d said economist John Gong of the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. In a worst-case scenario, China could walk away from the negotiations if it feels the U.S. side isn\u2019t treating China as an equal or isn\u2019t willing to take the first step to deescalate, Gong said.",
      "\u201cI think if (Bessent) doesn\u2019t go into this negotiation with this kind of mindset, this could be very difficult,\u201d he said.",
      "For now, the two countries can\u2019t even agree on who requested the talks. \u201cThe meeting is being held at the request of the U.S. side,\u2019\u2019 Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Wednesday. Trump disagreed. \u201cThey ought to go back and study their files,\u201d he said.",
      "What seems clear is that Trump\u2019s favorite economic weapon \u2014 import taxes, or tariffs \u2014 has not proved as mighty as he\u2019d hoped.",
      "\u201cFor Trump, what\u2019s happened here is that the rhetoric of his campaign has finally had to face economic reality,\u201d said Jeff Moon, a trade official in the Obama administration who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy. \u201cThe idea that he was going to bring China to its knees in terms of tariffs was never going to work.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump views tariffs an all-purpose economic tool that can raise money for the U.S. Treasury, protect American industries, lure factories to the United States and pressure other countries to bend to his will, even on issues such as immigration and drug trafficking.",
      "He used tariffs in his first term and has been even more aggressive and unpredictable about imposing them in his second. He\u2019s slapped a 10% tariff on almost every country in the world, blowing up the rules that had governed global trade for decades.",
      "But it\u2019s his trade war with China that has really put markets and businesses on edge. It started in February when he announced a 10% levy on Chinese imports. By April, Trump ratcheted up the taxes on China to a staggering 145%. Beijing upped its tariff on American products to 125%.",
      "Trump\u2019s escalation sent financial markets tumbling and left U.S. retailers warning that they might run out of goods as U.S.-China trade implodes. U.S. consumers, worried about the prospect of empty shelves and higher prices, are losing confidence in the economy.",
      "\u201cThis was not very well planned,\u2019\u2019 said Zongyuan Zoe Liu, senior fellow in China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cI don\u2019t think he intended to have the tariffs escalate into this chaos.\u2019\u2019",
      "When Trump hit Chinese imports with tariffs during his first term, he charged that Beijing used unfair tactics, including cybertheft, to give its technology firms an edge.",
      "The two countries reached a truce \u2014 the so-called Phase One agreement \u2014 in January 2020; China agreed to buy more U.S. products, and Trump held off on even higher tariffs. But they didn\u2019t resolve the big issues dividing them, including China\u2019s subsidies of homegrown tech firms.",
      "China was ready for a rematch when Trump returned to the White House. It had worked to reduce its dependence on America\u2019s massive market, cutting the U.S. share of its exports to 15% last year from more than 19% in 2018, according to Dexter Roberts of the Atlantic Council.",
      "Beijing is confident that the Chinese people are more willing than Americans to endure the fallout from a trade war, including falling exports and shuttered factories. \u201cFor China, it\u2019s painful, but it\u2019s also imperative to withstand it, and it\u2019s prepared to cope with it,\u2019\u2019 said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center.",
      "In addition to miscalculating Chinese resolve, the Trump administration may have underestimated how much America relies on China.",
      "For decades, Americans have come to depend on Chinese factories. They produce 97% of America\u2019s imported baby carriages, 96% of its artificial flowers and umbrellas, 95% of its fireworks, 93% of its children\u2019s coloring books and 90% of its combs.",
      "\u201cWithout us, what do they have to sell?\u201d Chinese toymaker Cheng Zhengren told Beijing News. \u201cTheir shelves would be empty.\u201d",
      "The showerhead company Afina last month reported on an experiment suggesting that American consumers have little willingness to pay more for American-made products. Afina makes a filtered showerhead in China and Vietnam that retails for $129. Making the same product in America would lift the price to $239. When customers on the company\u2019s website were given a choice between them, 584 chose the cheap Asian one; not one opted for the costlier U.S.-made version.",
      "And it\u2019s not just consumers who depend on China. America\u2019s own factories do, too. The National Association of Manufacturers calculates 47% of U.S. imports from China in 2023 were \u201cmanufacturing inputs\u2019\u2019 \u2014 industrial supplies, auto parts and capital equipment that American manufacturers used to make other their own products domestically. So Trump\u2019s tariffs risk raising costs and reducing supplies that U.S. factories rely on, making them less competitive.",
      "Louise Loo, China economist at Oxford Economics, a consulting firm, said that China\u2019s ability to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market in recent years means \u201cthey\u2019re probably likely to be able to find substitutes for buyers, much easier than the U.S. side will be able to find suppliers.\u201d",
      "Still, China won\u2019t emerge from a trade war unscathed either. Citing the impact of the trade war, the International Monetary Fund last month downgraded the outlook for the Chinese economy this year and next.",
      "\u201cChina needs the United States of America,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at Friday\u2019s news briefing. \u201cThey need our markets. They need our consumer base. And Secretary Bessent knows that he\u2019s going to Switzerland this weekend with the full support and confidence and trust of the president here at home.\u201d",
      "Indeed Moon, who also served as a diplomat in China, noted the tariffs cut both ways: \u201cBoth of them are highly dependent on bilateral trade. They have put themselves in a corner.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jens Eskelund, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, expressed relief that U.S. and Chinese officials were meeting.",
      "\u201cSo good,\u2019\u2019 he said, pointing to the Vatican conclave that just picked a new pope as inspiration. \u201cLock them in a room and then hopefully white smoke will come out.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Commercial fishermen are eager to see if President Donald Trump's command to shed federal fishing regulations will boost one of the nation's oldest industries",
      "STONINGTON, Maine -- Virginia Olsen has pulled lobsters from Maine's chilly Atlantic waters for decades while watching threats to the state's lifeblood industry mount.",
      "Trade imbalances with Canada, tight regulations on fisheries and offshore wind farms towering like skyscrapers on open water pose three of those threats, said Olsen, part of the fifth generation in her family to make a living in the lobster trade.",
      "That's why she was encouraged last month when President Donald Trump signed an executive order that promises to restore American fisheries to their former glory. The order promises to shred fishing regulations, and Olsen said that will allow fishermen to do what they do best \u2014 fish.",
      "That will make a huge difference in communities like her home of Stonington, the busiest lobster fishing port in the country, Olsen said. It's a tiny island town of winding streets, swooping gulls and mansard roof houses with an economy almost entirely dependent on commercial fishing, some three hours up the coast from Portland, Maine's biggest city.",
      "Olsen knows firsthand how much has changed over the years. Hundreds of fish and shellfish populations globally have dwindled to dangerously low levels, alarming scientists and prompting the restrictions and catch limits that Trump's order could wash away with the stroke of a pen. But she's heartened that the livelihoods of people who work the traps and cast the nets have become a priority in faraway places where they often felt their voices weren't heard.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s time to have the conversation on what regulations that the industry does need. We\u2019re fishing different than we did 100 years ago,\" she said. \u201cIf everything is being looked at, we should be looking at the regulations within the fishing industry.\u201d",
      "But if fishing and lobstering interests finally have a seat at the table, the questions become how much seafood can be served there \u2014 and for how long. Trump's April 17 order, called \u201cRestoring American Seafood Competitiveness,\u201d promises an overhaul of the way America fishes, and cites a national seafood trade deficit of more than $20 billion as the reason to do it. The order calls on the federal government to reduce the regulatory burden on fishermen by later this month.",
      "It arrives at a time when conservation groups and many marine scientists say the ocean needs more regulation, not less. One oft-cited 2020 study led by a scientist at the University of British Columbia looked at more than 1,300 fish and invertebrate populations and found that 82% were below levels that can produce maximum sustainable yields. The university said the study \u201cdiscovered global declines, some severe, of many popularly consumed species.\u201d",
      "Trump's order prioritizes commerce over conservation. It also calls for the development of a comprehensive seafood trade strategy and a review of existing marine monuments, which are underwater protected zones, to see if any should be opened for fishing. At least one, the Pacific Islands Heritage Marine National Monument, has already been reopened.",
      "Many commercial fishermen and fishing trade groups lauded the order. Members of the industry, one of the oldest in the country, have long made the case that heavy regulations \u2014 many intended to protect the health of fish populations \u2014 leave the U.S. at a competitive disadvantage to the fleets of countries that don't bear the same kind of burden. That disadvantage is a big piece of why America imports more than two-thirds of its seafood, they argue.",
      "\u201cThe president\u2019s executive order recognizes the challenges our fishing families and communities face, and we appreciate the commitment to reduce burdensome regulations and strengthen the competitiveness of American seafood,\u201d said Patrice McCarron, executive director of the Maine Lobstermen\u2019s Association.",
      "Some fishermen, including Maine lobsterman Don McHenan, said they're looking forward to members of the industry being able to fish in areas of the ocean that have been closed off to them for years. McHenan said he's also hopeful the pace of new regulations will slow.",
      "\u201cAs long as they don't put any more onto us,\u201d McHenan said. \u201cWe'll see \u2014 time will tell.\u201d",
      "But the support for deregulation is not unanimous among fishermen. Some say strong conservation laws are critical to protecting species that fishermen rely on to make a living.",
      "In Alaska, for example, Matt Wiebe said the executive order \u201cterrifies\u201d him. A commercial fisherman with more than 50 years of experience fishing for salmon, he said the order could potentially harm the Bristol Bay sockeye salmon fishery, which has received praise from sustainability organizations for careful management of the fish supply.",
      "Absent that management, he said the world's largest sockeye salmon fishery could go the way of the New England cod fishing business, which collapsed due in large part to overfishing and has never recovered.",
      "\u201cSince New England fishers lost their cod fishery due to overfishing, many other fisheries came to respect and depend on conservation efforts,\u201d Wiebe said. \u201cWe fish because it's what we do, and conservation efforts mean we and our kids can fish into the future.\u201d",
      "The executive order arrived at a time when America's commercial fishermen are coping with environmental challenges and the decline of some once-marketable species. Maine's historic shrimp fishery shuttered more than a decade ago, California's salmon industry is struggling through closures and the number of fish stocks on the federal overfished list has grown in recent years.",
      "There is also the looming question of what Trump's trade war with major seafood producers such as Canada and China will mean for the U.S. industry \u2014 not to mention American consumers.",
      "To many in Maine's lobster and fishing business, the answer is clear: Cut regulations and let them do their thing.",
      "\u201cWe definitely feel the industry is over-regulated as a whole,\" said Dustin Delano, a fourth-generation Maine lobsterman who is also chief operating officer of the New England Fishermen\u2019s Stewardship Association. \u201cWe hope that this will help for sure. It does seek to initiate that America-first strategy in the fishery.\u201d",

The plans for talks in Geneva, Switzerland, could bring a shift in the stalemate over President Donald Trump's hikes in tariffs on Chinese good to as much as 145%.",
      "But the world's two biggest economies are at odds over a raft of issues, including colliding strategic interests that will likely impede progress in the talks.",
      "Some of the punitive tariffs, including Beijing's retaliatory 125% tariffs on U.S. exports, could be rolled back, but a full reversal is unlikely, Zichun Huang of Capital Economics said in a report.",
      "\u201cThis means China\u2019s exports to the U.S. are set for further declines over the coming months, not all of which will be offset by increased trade with other countries. We still expect export growth to turn negative later this year,\u201d Huang said.",
      "China\u2019s politically sensitive trade surplus with the United States was nearly $20.5 billion in April, down from about $27.2 billion a year earlier. In the first four months of the year, China's exports to the United States fell 2.5% from a year earlier, while imports from the U.S. fell 4.7%.",
      "Preliminary data also show that U.S. imports from other countries not subject to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s 145% tariff on Chinese products have been rising quickly.",
      "Exports to the United States form just a part of China's trade, and exports to the rest of the world have helped offset that weakness. Exports to Southeast Asian countries were up 11.5% from a year earlier in the first four months of this year. Exports to Latin America also climbed 11.5%. Shipments to India jumped nearly 16% by value, and exports to Africa surged 15%.",
      "Some of the fastest growth was in Asia, reflecting moves by Chinese and other manufacturers to diversify their supply chains outside of the Chinese mainland.",
      "Exports to Vietnam jumped 18% year-on-year, while exports to Thailand were up 20%.",
      "Measured on a monthly basis, China's total exports rose just 0.6% in April, while imports increased by nearly 4% from March.",

      "The Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office closed on Wednesday the Center for Asbestos Related Disease in Libby, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from the U.S.-Canada border. The town of about 3,000 people is near a mine that produced asbestos dust for decades, and the clinic has been at the forefront of efforts to help victims.",
      "Courts in Montana have said BNSF contributed to the pollution when it brought contaminated material from the mine through town, and the railway separately faces numerous lawsuits from asbestos victims in Libby and surrounding communities.",
      "But the Texas-based railway prevailed in a 2023 lawsuit alleging the clinic fraudulently made some patients eligible for government benefits when it knew they were not sick. The railway challenged the validity of over 2,000 diagnoses by the clinic and 337 were ruled false.",
      "The railway brought the lawsuit on behalf of the federal government, which provides specialized Medicare services to Libby\u2019s asbestos victims. BNSF was entitled to a share of the $6 million judgment against the clinic, and after adding in attorney fees, court costs and interest, the railway says it\u2019s now owed $3.1 million.",
      "\u201cThe judge determined the amount of damages to be repaid, and the process for recovery is set by law,\" BNSF spokesperson Kendall Kirkham Sloan said in a statement.",

      "Long-threatened tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump have plunged the country into trade wars abroad \u2014 all while on-again, off-again new levies continue to escalate uncertainty.",
      "Trump is no stranger to tariffs. He launched a trade war during his first term, taking particular aim at China by putting taxes on most of its goods. Beijing responded with its own retaliatory tariffs on a range of U.S. products. Meanwhile, Trump also used the threat of more tariffs to force Canada and Mexico to renegotiate a North American trade pact, called the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, in 2020.",
      "When President Joe Biden took office, he preserved most of the tariffs Trump previously enacted against China, in addition to imposing some new restrictions. But his administration claimed to take a more targeted approach.",
      "Fast-forward to today, and economists stress there could be greater consequences on businesses and economies worldwide under Trump's more sweeping tariffs this time around \u2014 and that higher prices will likely leave consumers footing the bill.

      "The U.S. trade deficit soared to a record $140.5 billion in March as consumers and businesses tried to get ahead of Trump\u2019stariffs. Federal data showed an enormous stockpiling of pharmaceutical products. The deficit \u2014 which measures the gap between the value of goods and services the U.S. sells abroad against what it buys \u2014 has roughly doubled during the past year.",
      "Also, the U.S. government announced that top officials are set to meet with a high-level Chinese delegation over the weekend in Switzerland in the first major talks between the two nations since President Trump sparked a trade war. No country has been hit harder by Trump\u2019s trade war than China, the world\u2019s biggest exporter and second largest economy. U.S. tariffs against China are set at 145% and China tariffs on the U.S. at 125%.",
      "The Federal Reserve left its key interest rate unchanged at 4.3%, saying that the risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen due to uncertainty about how and when Trump\u2019s tariffs might impact the U.S. economy. Chair Jerome Powell underscored that the tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment and that there\u2019s currently too many unknowns to be able to predict how the Fed might adjust its monetary policy going forward.",
      "The United States and Britain announced a trade deal, potentially lowering the financial burden from tariffs while creating greater access abroad for American goods. The president said the agreement would lead to more beef and ethanol exports to the U.K., which would also streamline the processing of U.S. goods though customs. Trump said final details were being written up. \u201cIn the coming weeks, we\u2019ll have it all very conclusive,\u201d Trump said.",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- In the run-up to the annual U.N. climate conference, set to take place in Brazil\u2019s Amazon in November, the construction of a road is drawing attention, with critics arguing it will lead to environmental degradation.",
      "Before the talks, called COP30, the state government of Para is building a 13-kilometer (8-mile) avenue designed to ease traffic on a major highway that runs parallel.",
      "The road was planned long before Belem, a metropolitan area of 2.5 million people that sits on the edge of the Amazon, was chosen as conference host. That hasn't spared it sharp criticism, however, because the road is expected to cut across the last remnants of rainforest in Belem.",
      "Road building in the Amazon, which historically has often led to deforestation and development of surrounding areas, also stands in stark contrast to a central aim of climate conferences, and in particular this one: conservation of biodiversity.",

      "An official project map shows a straight line dividing a green area through the city\u2019s outskirts. This protected area is slightly larger than Manhattan. It was designated in 1993 to protect two lakes, a river basin and to restore a degraded rainforest. However, its rules allow private properties, government-approved deforestation and public works. Two university campuses are located within its limits.",
      "\u201cEven with measures to reduce the damage, there are tough issues to address,\u201d said Roberta Rodrigues, a professor of architecture at the Federal University of Para. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a road being built along the banks of the Guama River without it leading to illegal development. It may lead to the end of this protected area.\"",
      "The project dates back to 2020. Construction began in mid-2024, despite criticism over its impact on one of the city\u2019s few remaining green areas. The project drew wider attention in March, when the BBC reported that the avenue was \"being built for COP30.\u201d As the story was picked up by news outlets around the world, Brazil\u2019s government issued a statement saying the avenue wasn't among the 33 infrastructure projects planned for COP30.",

      "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) \u2014 India and Pakistan have fought three full-scale wars since they gained independence from Britain in 1947. They\u2019ve also had dozens of skirmishes and conflicts, including one atop a glacier dubbed the coldest and highest-altitude battlefield in the world.",
      "The latest escalation follows a deadly gun attack on tourists that India blames Pakistan for \u2014 Islamabad denies any connection. But they don\u2019t fight wars like other countries.",
      "The dominant factor is their nuclear weapons arsenal, a distinct way of deterring major attacks and a guarantee that fighting doesn\u2019t get out of hand, even when the situation is spiraling.",
      "Here\u2019s how \u2014 and why \u2014 India and Pakistan fight the way they do:",
      "\u201cPakistan and India have enough nuclear weapons to wipe the other side out several times over,\u201d says security analyst Syed Mohammed Ali, who is based in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital. \u201cTheir nuclear weapons create a scenario for mutually assured destruction.\u201d",
      "Both countries have \u201cdeliberately developed\u201d the size and range of their stockpile to remind the other about the guarantee of mutually assured destruction, he adds.",
      "Neither country discloses their nuclear capabilities but each is thought to have between 170 and 180 warheads that are short-, long- and medium-range. Both countries have different delivery systems \u2014 ways of launching and propelling these weapons to their targets.",
      "The arsenals are a defensive move to prevent and deter further fighting, because \u201cneither side can afford to initiate such a war or hope to achieve anything from it,\u201d Ali says.",
      "It might not look this way to the outsider, but nuclear weapons are a reminder to the other side that they can't take things too far.",
      "But the secrecy around their arsenals means that it's unclear if Pakistan or India can survive a first nuclear strike and retaliate, something called \u201csecond-strike capability.\u201d",
      "This capacity stops an opponent from attempting to win a nuclear war through a first strike by preventing aggression that could lead to nuclear escalation.",
      "Without this capability, there is, in theory, nothing to stop one side from launching a warhead at the other.",
      "India and Pakistan have each laid claim to Kashmir since 1947, when both gained independence, and border skirmishes have created instability in the region for decades. Each country controls a part of Kashmir, which is divided by a heavily militarized border.",
      "The two archrivals have also fought two of their three wars over Kashmir \u2014 a disputed Himalayan region divided between the them where armed insurgents resist Indian rule. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "Border flare-ups and militant attacks in India-controlled Kashmir have prompted New Delhi to take an increasingly tough position on Islamabad, accusing it of \u201cterrorism.\u201d",
      "In the latest conflict, India punished Pakistan by hitting what it said were sites used by Pakistan-backed militants linked to a gun massacre last month.",
      "India is one of the biggest defense spenders in the world, with $74.4 billion in 2025, according to the Military Balance report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies. It\u2019s also one of the world\u2019s largest arms importers.",
      "Pakistan is no slouch, spending $10 billion last year, but it can never match India\u2019s deep pockets. India also has more than double the number of active armed forces personnel than Pakistan does.",
      "While India\u2019s armed forces are traditionally focused on Pakistan, it has another nuclear neighbor to contend with, China, and it is increasingly concerned with maritime security in the Indian Ocean. Those are two factors that Pakistan doesn\u2019t have to consider in its security paradigm.",
      "Pakistan's long and narrow shape, together with the outsized role of the military in foreign policy, makes it easier to move the armed forces around and prioritize defense.",
      "Neither Pakistan or India are in a hurry to announce their military moves against the other and, as seen in the current flare-up of hostilities, it can take a while for confirmation of strikes and retaliation to surface.",
      "But both launch operations into territories and airspace controlled by the other. Sometimes these are intended to damage checkpoints, installations, or sites allegedly used by militants.",
      "They are also aimed at embarrassing or provoking \u2014 forcing leaders to bow to public pressure and respond, with the potential for miscalculation.",
      "Many of these activities originate along the Line of Control, which divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan. It's largely inaccessible to the media and public, making it hard to independently verify claims of an attack or retaliation.",
      "Such incidents raise international alarm, because both countries have nuclear capabilities, forcing attention back to India and Pakistan and, eventually, their competing claims over Kashmir.",
      "The fear of nuclear war has put the two countries at the top of the agenda, competing with the papal conclave, U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s policies, and the Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs trial in the news cycle.",
      "Pakistan and India\u2019s battles and skirmishes are away from the public eye.",

It shows that neither country has the desire to significantly harm the other\u2019s population. Attacks are either described as surgical or limited.",

Pakistan has huge mineral wealth, but India isn't interested in these and, while there are stark ideological differences between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan, they don\u2019t seek control or influence over the other.",

      "The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the U.S. economy",
      "WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week despite heightened uncertainty about how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will impact the U.S. and global economies.",
      "Jobless claim applications fell by 13,000 to 228,000 for the week ending May 3, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s in line with the 229,000 new applications analysts forecast.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered a proxy for layoffs, and have mostly bounced around a healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 decimated the economy and wiped out millions of jobs.",
      "Even though Trump has paused or pulled back on many of his tariff threats, concerns remain about a global economic slowdown that could upend the U.S. labor market, which has been a pillar of the American economy for years.",
      "On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting, after cutting it three times in a row at the end of last year.",
      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the risks of both higher unemployment and inflation have risen, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low.",
      "Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment but that data has not yet shown significant harm to the economy.",
      "A contraction has already begun in the U.S., where the economy shrank at a 0.3% annual pace from January through March as Trump\u2019s trade wars disrupted business. First-quarter growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the United States tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "It was the first quarterly GDP decline in three years.",
      "Like his pledge to institute tariffs, Trump\u2019s promise to drastically downsize the federal government workforce has occupied much of the early weeks of his presidency and is still in motion.",
      "It\u2019s not clear when the job cuts ordered by the Department of Government Efficiency \u2014 or \u201cDOGE,\u201d spearheaded by Elon Musk \u2014 will surface in the weekly layoffs data. However, the federal government staff reductions are already being felt, even outside of the Washington, D.C. area.",
      "Despite showing some signs of weakening during the past year, the labor market remains robust with plentiful jobs and relatively few layoffs.",
      "Last week the government reported that U.S. employers added a surprisingly strong 177,000 jobs in April. The unemployment rate held at a historically healthy 4.2%, however, many economists anticipate that a negative impact from trade wars will materialize this year for American workers.",
      "Companies that have announced job cuts this year include Workday, Dow, CNN, Starbucks, Southwest Airlines and Facebook parent company Meta.",
      "The Labor Department reported that the four-week average of claims, which evens out some of the week-to-week gyrations, inched up by 1,000 to 227,000.",
      "The total number of Americans receiving unemployment benefits for the week of April 26 fell to 1.88 million, a decrease of 29,000.",

      "Melinda French Gates says she and her ex-husband, Bill Gates, always intended for the foundation they started together to spend down all of its resources rather than to exist in perpetuity",
      "Melinda French Gates entered some of the most powerful circles while leading the foundation she co-founded with her ex-husband, Bill Gates.",
      "She petitioned heads of state and convened other billionaires. Along with Gates, she won the trust of one of America's most admired investors, Warren Buffett, who has given more than $43 billion to the former couple's foundation.",
      "French Gates, who studied computer science and worked at Microsoft, the company Gates created, exited the Gates Foundation last year to pursue philanthropy and investment through her own organization, Pivotal Ventures, which she started in 2015. The foundation changed its name from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation after her departure.",
      "At an ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, which also launched her new memoir, French Gates said she left, in part, to respond to the U.S. rollback of women\u2019s rights.",
      "\u201cI thought, I want to be much more nimble than this, and I want to be able to set the agenda by myself without having to ask anybody else, and do it with my partners,\u201d she said.",
      "French Gates offered written responses to The Associated Press' questions about the foundation\u2019s 25th anniversary and its decision to close in 2045. She said the former couple had always intended to spend down their resources.",
      "\u201cUltimately, though,\" she wrote, \u201cthe timeline was Bill\u2019s decision to make with the board of trustees.\u201d",
      "The following responses have been edited for length.",
      "A: To me, the greatest measure of success would be if long after the foundation closed, someone, somewhere, was living a life that looked different because we existed. We talked a lot there about unlocking virtuous cycles. I like to think that right now, the foundation\u2019s work is contributing to a child getting a vaccine or a woman opening her first bank account \u2014 and that decades from now, their families and communities are going to continue to look different, because of what that child and that woman unlocked for the people around them.",
      "A: I was excited for us to launch the Giving Pledge because I believe that the most responsible thing to do with great wealth is give it away \u2014 and that you have an obligation to society to give it away as effectively as possible. I think it\u2019s important for people in that position to set norms around giving generously and to learn as much as possible from each other about how to be effective in their philanthropy.",
      "(As for gender), for too long, global health and development efforts treated women and girls as secondary \u2014 if they were considered at all. Data wasn\u2019t collected on their experiences. Their specific health needs were often ignored.",
      "There were so many questions that needed to be asked: What is the cost of all the unpaid labor women do at home? Will mobile banking make a difference if women don\u2019t have equal access to cellphones? Why are so many infectious diseases especially dangerous for women?",
      "We opened a gender equality division, but not just that \u2014 we made gender equality a priority across all of our work. And we put a lot of resources into expanding access to contraception, starting with a big commitment we made in 2012.",
      "A: When you\u2019re doing this kind of work, it doesn\u2019t take long to see that solutions that seem great on paper may not work in reality. We funded community toilets in India that people \u2014 especially women \u2014wouldn\u2019t use because they were dangerous to go to at night. We funded vaccines in Vietnam that had to be kept cold, but came in packaging that didn\u2019t fit into the small refrigerators most people had there. We funded a simple pump to help East African farmers irrigate their land, but women \u2014 who account for half of all smallholder farmers \u2014 wouldn\u2019t buy it, because they didn\u2019t want to be seen swaying their hips in the way the pump required.",
      "There are many ways to learn about the cultural norms and logistical issues that determine whether a solution is feasible \u2014 and they all boil down to engaging people with local knowledge and lived experience, and trusting what they tell you.",
      "A: It\u2019s easy for people to forget \u2014 or maybe they didn\u2019t ever know \u2014 how hopeless the situation seemed around the year 2000, when malaria, tuberculosis and HIV were totally out of control. Since then, efforts funded, in large part, by development aid have saved more than 65 million lives from those diseases alone.",
      "No doubt the work has just gotten a lot harder, but we never thought it was going to be easy. And we still have the key ingredients of success. The pipeline of innovations has never been stronger. More lower-income countries are taking a leading role. As some donors announce cuts, others are stepping up.",

      "INDIAN WELLS, Ca. -- Bill Gates is pledging 99% of his remaining fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will spend it all within 20 years. The funds will be delivered over time and will allow the foundation to spend another $200 billion by the time it closes in 2045.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a little bit more that goes to the kids and some portion that, you know, I won\u2019t be wanting for anything for my consumption,\u201d Gates said. Even his climate-related investments, \u201call of the profits that come from that work go into the Gates Foundation.\u201d",
      "In interviews with The Associated Press, Gates spoke about the foundation\u2019s past work and future goals. His responses have been edited for length.",
      "\u201cI hope other people wallop me. Even today, there\u2019s probably a dozen people richer than I am, because I don\u2019t count the money that I\u2019ve already got in the foundation. I have just a bit over $100 billion outside of the foundation. I\u2019d love to be beat in all of this work. Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than I\u2019ve been.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone. It will be spent. Hopefully, many of these diseases are eradicated, so nobody even knows, \u2018What was malaria? What was polio?\u2019 in the years ahead. You know, some foundations, if they\u2019ve been around 50 or 60 years, who knows how their work relates to the intent of the person who started that foundation? And I do think there\u2019ll be more rich people in the future than there are today. So yes, it will create a vacuum in 20 years, and we\u2019re letting people know way in advance that\u2019s what this will look like.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s by some measures the most generous gift ever given and a real vote of confidence from Warren, who\u2019s a great friend and has always given me phenomenal advice and is very driven by these inequity issues. And that was in 2006, and so it\u2019s two years later that I give up my full-time work at Microsoft, and I move over. And I\u2019ve been full time at the foundation since 2008 for the rest of my life. It\u2019s my final, second career. You know, Warren, it\u2019s hard to overstate the impact he\u2019s had on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was a big hope, that the societal expectation for anybody who has a lot of money would be that they give the majority of it away, and that basically everyone would join into that. Now, we\u2019re not at that level, but I think year by year, people are saying, \u2018Hey, the fairness of this system, the legitimacy of this system really benefits if those who both through skill and luck, the system has rewarded them, that they put a lot of their resources and even, some of their time and energy into improving society.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cMany things now are making it less clear how much progress we\u2019ll make in these 20 years we have remaining. The donors are being somewhat less generous as they feel squeezed by an aging population and demands for Ukraine, both refugee costs, defense costs, a lot of things. And so telling the story of the success and the moral and geopolitical value of taking 1% of rich country budgets and saying, \u2018No, this is to save lives for very, very, very little money.\u2019 We\u2019re going to have to renew people\u2019s understanding and prioritization of these things in order to keep that piece. We have a lot of things we\u2019re optimistic about because we have new tools, new ways of protecting women from getting HIV, new ways of killing mosquitoes... And so it\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them. So, it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",
      "\u201cMelinda has made a phenomenal contribution to the foundation, helping us pick the right people and being in partnerships, traveling the world, bringing her perspective to things. I can\u2019t say enough good things about how she got us off on the right track. When we divorced, we hoped \u2014 I hoped \u2014 that she would choose to stay. She stayed for a period of time, continued to do great work, and then chose to do the philanthropy on her own.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur work is for saving children\u2019s lives. So it\u2019s true, if they have other priorities, it\u2019s hard to influence my commitment to not having mothers bleed to death or kids not dying from malaria. To be honest, the number of civil society actors that are in here trying to influence the work we do is so tiny. It\u2019s unbelievable. I mean, I could almost list their names on one piece of paper. Where are these people? We want more people second-guessing our work, criticizing our work. I mean, what\u2019s their idea about malnutrition? What\u2019s their idea on how to deal with these funding cuts? What do they want us to do?\u201d",

      "SEATTLE -- In its first 25 years, the Gates Foundation became one of the world\u2019s largest charitable foundations and one of the most powerful institutions in global health \u2014 an accomplishment that carried both accolades and controversy.",
      "Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates had grand ambitions for their foundation, but little experience in global health or philanthropy. They were moved by stories like those written by New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof about children dying from diseases caused by a lack of sanitation. In characteristic Gates style, they tackled these problems with rigor, data and close oversight.",
      "As a result, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \u2014 formed in 2000 by the merger of two family foundations and funded by Gates\u2019 Microsoft wealth and later, by tens of billions from investor Warren Buffett \u2014 inserted itself into the architecture of global health.",
      "Along the way, the foundation\u2019s leaders redefined what it means to be philanthropists.",
      "\u201cAs I was learning about what children die of, you know, HIV and diarrhea and pneumonia, were all things that I was stunned how little was going into helping the poor countries,\u201d Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "He responded in a way few others could, by pouring billions into the foundation, which spent $100 billion in its first 25 years, with about half going toward global health.",
      "Thanks to its largesse, as well as the expertise of its employees, its connections to governments and companies, and the profile of its founders, the Gates Foundation now garners at least the same influence, if not more, in almost any global health forum as many countries.",
      "That era now has an end date. Gates announced Thursday that the foundation will close in 2045, pledging that he plans to donate 99% of his remaining fortune, which would be $107 billion today, to the nonprofit by then. Gates said the foundation can maintain its culture and workforce over that time.",
      "\"We\u2019ll be showing that we\u2019re doing the most we can and give a lot of predictability to the field by (saying,) \u2018We\u2019ll be here all of those 20 years, but not thereafter,\u2019\" he said.",
      "The foundation's influence over global health policy and its partnerships with companies and other private sector actors have long drawn questions.",
      "Researcher Linsey McGoey, a professor of sociology at the University of Essex, who wrote the book \u201cNo Such Thing as a Free Gift \u201d about the foundation, asks how charitable it is to \u201cgive away\u201d money to a foundation the donor controls.",
      "Others like Anuj Kapilashrami, global health professor at the University of Essex, argue the foundation's preference for low-cost treatments and interventions does not inherently help build the capacity of health systems.",
      "\u201cWe do not tackle the causes, the underlying drivers of what is producing ill-health, but we choose areas and health issues where we can just push these magic bullets: commodities, drugs (and) bed nets,\u201d she said.",
      "Mark Suzman, who has been with the foundation for 18 years and CEO since 2020, said close supervision of grantees and the foundation\u2019s data-driven processes are key to its success.",
      "\u201cWe are not a 'write the check, call us in three years and let us know what it looks like,\u2019\u201d kind of funder, Suzman said. \u201cWe\u2019ll be calling you up probably every week, and we\u2019ll have some opinions. But we want your opinions back.\u201d",
      "The foundation is proud of the many vaccines, medical devices and treatment protocols it has helped develop. It is optimistic about a pipeline of innovations, including potential vaccines for malaria and HIV, as possible accomplishments in its remaining 20 years.",
      "David McCoy, a physician who was then at the University College London, argued back in 2009 that only a small portion of the foundation\u2019s spending went directly to organizations located in the countries where they work, with most going to international organizations like the World Health Organization or to groups located in the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Suzman said he has been an internal champion of shifting more of the foundation's work from Seattle to in-country offices.",
      "The foundation\u2019s flagship issue, and the main way it measures its success, is in reducing preventable childhood deaths.",
      "The Gates Foundation helped establish two major public-private partnerships: Gavi, the vaccine alliance that funds and distributes vaccines for children, and the Global Fund, which, along with governments, funds the treatment and control of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria.",
      "The foundation says the two organizations have saved tens of millions of lives and are some of the most important examples of its impact.",
      "However, Amy Patterson, politics professor at The University of the South, Sewanee, says public-private partnerships like Gavi and the Global Fund diminish the power of civil society groups and citizens compared to public health systems.",
      "\u201cIt certainly has moved us from thinking about health as a state responsibility, which raises questions about accountability and participation,\u201d said Patterson, who has researched the management of AIDS in African countries, including the role of civic groups.",
      "\u201cThat is not to discount the millions of lives saved, or children immunized, or women who have access to reproductive health, or the innovations that have brought efficiency,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cBut if you think about the social contract between states taking care of their people, how do we have that same kind of accountability in this type of a system?\u201d",
      "A huge moment in the early history of the foundation came in 2006 when Buffett pledged to donate a percentage of his Berkshire Hathaway shares annually, almost doubling the foundation\u2019s resources.",
      "Buffett teamed with Gates and French Gates again in 2010 to launch a new commitment for billionaires: to give away more than half their money in their lifetimes or at the time of their death.",
      "The Giving Pledge now has more than 240 people agreeing to those terms, far exceeding Gates\u2019 expectations. However, certainly not every billionaire has.",
      "Gates hopes others will surpass his giving.",
      "\u201cI'd love to be beat in all of this work,\" he said. \"Somebody should try and pay more taxes than I did, and save more lives than I did, and give more money than I did, and be smarter than I\u2019ve been.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that cuts to foreign aid and health funding under President Donald Trump's current administration, wars, and economic turmoil significantly challenge the foundation's hopes of eradicating polio, controlling malaria, and reducing the number of child and maternal deaths in the next 20 years.",
      "\u201cThe metric that we should be measured against is the success of the whole global health field. Did we draw people in? Did we keep governments engaged, and therefore, do we get childhood death rates down from the 5 million to cut it in half again?\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t promise you we will, because without the partners, that\u2019s not doable.

      "Bill Gates says he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation",
      "SEATTLE -- SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Bill Gates says he will donate 99% of his remaining tech fortune to the Gates Foundation, which will now close in 2045, earlier than previously planned. Today, that would be worth an estimated $107 billion.",
      "The pledge is among the largest philanthropic gifts ever \u2013 outpacing the historic contributions of industrialists like John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie when adjusted for inflation. Only Berkshire Hathaway investor Warren Buffett's pledge to donate his fortune \u2014 currently estimated by Forbes at $160 billion \u2014 may be larger depending on stock market fluctuations.",
      "Gates' donation will be delivered over time and allow the foundation to spend an additional $200 billion over the next 20 years. The foundation already has an endowment of $77 billion built from donations from Gates, Melinda French Gates and Buffett.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of thrilling to have that much to be able to put into these causes,\u201d Gates said in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "His announcement Thursday signals both a promise of sustained support to those causes, particularly global health and education in the U.S., and an eventual end to the foundation\u2019s immense worldwide influence. Gates says spending down his fortune will help save and improve many lives now, which will have positive ripple effects well beyond the foundation's closure. It also makes it more likely that his intentions are honored.",
      "\u201cI think 20 years is the right balance between giving as much as we can to make progress on these things and giving people a lot of notice that now this money will be gone,\u201d Gates said.",
      "In a league of its own",
      "The pledge is \u201ca welcome bit of boldness,\u201d at a time when optimism is in short supply said, Rhodri Davies, a philanthropy expert and author of the publication, \u201cPublic Good by Private Means.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis announcement seems like yet more evidence that norms in foundation philanthropy might be shifting\u201d away from a default of operating in perpetuity, he said.",
      "The Gates Foundation has long been peerless among foundations \u2014 attracting supporters and detractors but also numerous unfounded conspiracy theories.",
      "In addition to the $100 billion it has spent since its founding 25 years ago, it has directed scientific research, helped develop new technologies, and nurtured long-term partnerships with countries and companies.",
      "About 41% of the foundation\u2019s money so far has come from Warren Buffett and the rest from the fortune Gates made at Microsoft.",
      "Started by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates in 2000, the foundation plays a significant role in shaping global health policy and has carved out a special niche by partnering with companies to drive down the cost of medical treatments so low- and middle-income countries could afford them.",
      "\u201cThe foundation work has been way more impactful than I expected,\u201d Gates said, calling it his second and final career.",
      "The foundation\u2019s influence on global health \u2014 from the World Health Organization to research agendas \u2014 is both a measure of its success and a magnet for criticism. For years, researchers have asked why a wealthy family should have so much sway over how the world improves people\u2019s health and responds to crises.",
      "Gates said, like any private citizen, he can choose how to spend the money he earns and has decided to do everything he can to reduce childhood deaths.",
      "\u201cIs that a bad thing? It\u2019s not an important cause? People can criticize it,\u201d he said, but the foundation will stick to its global health work.",
      "The Associated Press receives financial support for news coverage in Africa from the Gates Foundation and for news coverage of women in the workforce and statehouses from Melinda French Gates\u2019 organization, Pivotal Ventures.",
      "Major ambitions for the remaining 20 years",
      "The foundation\u2019s most prized metric is the drop in childhood deaths from preventable causes by almost half between 2000 and 2020, according to United Nations figures. The foundation\u2019s CEO Mark Suzman is careful to say they do not take credit for this accomplishment. But he believes they had a \u201ccatalytic role\u201d \u2014 for example, in helping deliver vaccines to children through Gavi, the vaccine alliance they helped create.",
      "The foundation still has numerous goals \u2014 eradicating polio, controlling other deadly diseases, like malaria, and reducing malnutrition, which makes children more vulnerable to other illnesses.",
      "Gates hopes that by spending to address these issues now, wealthy donors will be free to tackle other problems later.",
      "The Gates Foundation had planned to wind down two decades after Gates' death, meaning today\u2019s announcement significantly moves up that timetable. Gates plans to stay engaged, though at 69, he acknowledged he may not have a say.",
      "In its remaining two decades, the foundation will maintain a budget of around $9 billion a year, which represents a leveling off from its almost annual growth since 2006, when Buffett first started donating.",
      "Suzman expects the foundation will narrow its focus to top priorities.",
      "\u201cHaving that time horizon and the resources just puts an even greater burden on us to say, \u2018Are you actually putting your resources, your thumb down, on what are going to be the biggest, most successful bets rather than scattering it too thinly?\u2019\" Suzman said, which he acknowledged was creating uncertainty even within the foundation about what programs would continue.",
      "Gates is the only remaining founder",
      "Major changes preceded the foundation's 25th year.",
      "In 2021, Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates divorced, and Buffett resigned as the foundation\u2019s trustee. They recruited a new board of trustees to help govern the foundation, and in 2024, French Gates left to continue work at her own organization.",
      "French Gates said she decided to step down partly to focus on countering the rollback of women\u2019s rights in the U.S. At the ELLE Women of Impact event in New York in April, she said she wanted to leave the foundation at a high point.",
      "\u201cI so trusted Mark Suzman, the current CEO,\" she said. \u201cWe had a board in place that I helped put in place, and I knew their values.\u201d",
      "Even as the foundation\u2019s governance stabilizes, the road ahead looks difficult. Enduring conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza, global economic turmoil and cuts to foreign aid forecast fewer resources coming to global health and development.",
      "\u201cThe greatest uncertainty for us is the generosity that will go into global health,\u201d Gates said. \u201cWill it continue to go down like it has the last few years or can we get it back to where it should be?\u201d",
      "Even facing these obstacles, Gates and the foundation speak, as they often do, with optimism, pointing to innovations they\u2019ve funded or ways they\u2019ve helped reduce the cost of care.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s incredible to come up with these low-cost things and tragic if we can\u2019t get them out to everyone who needs them,\u201d Gates said. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to require renewing that commitment of those who are well off to help those who are in the greatest need.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- When it comes to Medicaid, Rep. Juan Ciscomani is telling fellow Republicans he won't support steep cuts that could hit thousands of residents in his Arizona district \u2014 \u201cmy neighbors, people my kids go to school with\u201d \u2014 who depend on it.",
      "Republican Rep. Don Bacon, who represents the liberal-leaning \u201cblue dot\u201d of Omaha, Nebraska, is trying to protect several Biden-era green energy tax breaks.

      "While it\u2019s often the most conservative members of the House Freedom Caucus driving the legislative agenda \u2014 and they are demanding as much as $2 trillion in cuts \u2014 it\u2019s the more centrist-leaning conservatives who could sink the bill. They have been hauled into meetings with Trump at the White House, some have journeyed to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, and many are huddling almost daily with House Speaker Mike Johnson.",
      "And they are not satisfied, yet.",
      "\u201cTo get everybody politically and policy-wise on the same page is going to require more conversations,\u201d said LaLota, who is among five Republicans pledging to withhold their support unless changes to the SALT deduction are included.",
      "Diving into the gritty details of the massive package, the GOP leaders are running into the stubborn reality that not all the ideas from their menu of potential tax breaks and spending cuts are popular with voters back home.",
      "Moreover, their work of compiling the big package is not happening in a vacuum. It comes amid growing economic unease rippling across the country as Trump has fired thousands of federal workers, including some of their own constituents, and as his trade war sparks concerns of empty store shelves and higher prices.",
      "Brendan Buck, a former adviser to an earlier House speaker, Paul Ryan, warned in an op-ed Wednesday that all the party's energy is being poured into one bill, with questionable returns.",
      "\"Many Republicans are hoping that the tax bill can blunt the economic damage caused by the Trump tariffs,\" Buck wrote in The New York Times, \u201cbut that is highly unlikely.\u201d",
      "Democrats are ready for the fight, warning that Trump and his fellow Republicans are ripping away health care and driving the economy into the ditch \u2014 all to retain tax breaks approved during Trump's first term that are expiring at year's end.",

      "The speaker's office has become a waystation with a revolving door of Republicans privately laboring to piece together the massive package.",
      "So far, GOP leaders have signaled they are walking away from some, but not all, of the steep Medicaid cuts. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said the proposals could result in millions of people losing their coverage.",
      "Instead, what appears to still be on the table are tougher work requirements for those receiving Medicaid and food stamp assistance and more frequent eligibility tests for beneficiaries.",
      "That's not enough for the conservatives, who also number in the dozens and are insisting on deeper reductions.",

I think it\u2019s very important they know that.\u201d",

      "\u201cGo with a scalpel. Go pick out some things,\u201d Bacon told The Associated Press. He and the others warned that companies are already investing millions of dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act's incentives to green energy.",

      "Democratic Sens. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Cory Booker of New Jersey visited Ciscomani's Tucson-based district last month to offer harsh condemnations.",
      "Kelly asked how many in the room were represented by Ciscomani, and then he warned about how scores of residents in the district could lose their health care coverage.",
      "\u201cAnd for what? It is so Donald Trump could give a big, giant tax cut to the wealthiest Americans. It is not fair,\u201d Kelly said.",
      "Booker, fresh off his 25-hour speech on the Senate floor, was even more pointed, saying just three House Republicans have to change their mind to upend the GOP\u2019s effort in the House, with its narrow majority.",
      "\u201cI believe one of them has to be in this district right here,\u201d Booker said. \u201cEither he changes his mind or this district changes congresspeople. It\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The road to the U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement was paved with challenges",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Last fall, weeks before Donald Trump was elected U.S. president, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy floated a pitch that proposed, among other things,\u202fan economic deal that would allow Washington access to Ukraine\u2019s largely untapped minerals and deepen strategic ties.",
      "Under pressure from Western allies and amid global war fatigue, Zelenskyy saw that the days of Biden administration-era robust military aid might be numbered, and so the pitch was part of the Ukrainian leader\u2019s so-called victory plan to end the Russia-Ukraine war. It was an offer that would appeal to Trump\u2019s penchant for transactions-based diplomacy in hopes of ensuring a steady flow of future American support in return.",
      "Seven months later, a landmark deal between Ukraine and the Trump administration on Ukraine\u2019s mineral resources was inked. But the road in between was paved with mutual recriminations, a historic Oval Office blowout, \u201chundreds\u201d of revisions, and finally, a chance meeting on the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral.",
      "Last minute snags threatened to undermine the signing of the agreement, but in the end Ukraine secured a deal that, once set in motion, brings closer ties with the U.S. and a provides a vehicle for future military assistance.\u202f Ukraine\u2019s parliament is expected to pass the agreement on Thursday, and other documents pertaining to the deal are being finalized.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that this is the first time in history that the United States considers Ukraine as a long-term strategic partner, economically,\u201d Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko said at a media briefing in Kyiv on Thursday, hours before the parliament vote.",
      "Here\u2019s a timeline of the deal\u2019s conception and signing:",
      "In response to rising pressure from Western allies and clear battlefield disadvantages, Zelenskyy outlines a so-called victory plan to end the war. The plan sought to strengthen Kyiv\u2019s negotiating hand and proposed measures to boost its military potential, but also economic partnerships with Western allies.",
      "Ukraine is rich in natural resources, including critically important metals such as uranium, titanium, lithium, and graphite.",
      "Zelenskyy pitches the plan to the White House during a visit to Washington in late September, and later in a meeting with Trump at Trump Tower in New York.",
      "Giving American companies preferential access to Ukraine would serve as leverage against Russia as most mineral deposits are located very close to front-line areas. Having U.S. companies on the ground, the thinking goes, would cement Washington's interests in Ukraine and serve as a de facto security guarantee. Critical minerals used to manufacture weapons, aviation and batteries would also give the U.S. access to reserves in a global market dominated by China.",
      "Trump appears captivated by the idea and very soon after his inauguration in January starts touting the idea of getting Ukraine\u2019s rare earth elemnts.",
      "By February, the White House and Ukraine appear to have made significant progress toward reaching an agreement that would provide the U.S. with access to Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals.",
      "On Feb. 12, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent arrives in Kyiv, becoming the first senior Trump administration official to visit and expecting Zelenskyy to sign the deal that day amid a push by Washington quickly end the war. But the Ukrainian president declines, saying elements of the draft didn't align with his country\u2019s constitution. The deal would have given the U.S. 50% rights to Ukraine\u2019s minerals and mentioned nothing of security guarantees.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t let the ministers sign \u2026 because in my view it is not ready to protect us, our interest,\u201d Zelenskyy told The Associated Press at the Munich Security Conference in February.",
      "Bessent later said in an interview with Tucker Carlson that Zelenskyy \u201cblew up\u201d the deal.",
      "Zelenskyy shot back, saying Bessent\u2019s approach had been disrespectful.",
      "\u201cMy colleagues know that if someone taps their finger on an agreement and says, \u2018You must sign now\u2019 \u2014 I could only say to him, \u2018Stop tapping your finger and let\u2019s have a proper conversation,'\u201d Zelenskyy later said in recounting the meeting in April to reporters in Kyiv.",
      "The two sides agreed to a new draft later in February.",
      "And on Feb. 28, Zelenskyy arrived in Washington with the intention of signing the revised version of the deal. But Zelenskyy insists on adding explicit U.S. security guarantees to the deal, saying that Russian President Vladimir Putin couldn\u2019t be trusted to comply with a ceasefire deal. A shouting match breaks out in the Oval Office, and Trump berates the Ukrainian president for not demonstrating gratitude for American support.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not in a good position. You don\u2019t have the cards right now. With us, you start having cards,\u201d Trump shouted.",
      "Zelenskyy leaves the White House with no deal and a deeply uncertain future with Washington. Shortly after, the U.S. pauses military aid and intelligence-sharing with Ukraine.",
      "According to multiple Ukrainian and Western officials, results from ceasefire talks between Ukrainian and U.S. delegates in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on March 11 marked a turning point after the disastrous Oval Office meeting.",
      "Ukraine agrees to a U.S. proposal for a full and immediate 30-day ceasefire, pending approval by the Kremlin, which had so far opposed anything short of a permanent end to the conflict without accepting any concessions. By piling conditions on both proposals for both full and partial ceasefires, Putin began testing Trump\u2019s patience.",
      "Meanwhile, technical discussions over the minerals deal resume. But the Trump administration introduces a new clause demanding that Ukraine reimburse the full amount of U.S. aid provided since the start of the full-scale invasion. Trump mentions a $500 billion figure as compensation, an amount many times more than the sum of aid provided.",
      "Ukrainian officials continue lobbying for a more equitable structure that respects Ukraine\u2019s strategic interests and state sovereignty. Zelenskyy spells out three core principles: The creation of a joint investment fund, 50-50 governance and the exclusion of debt repayment.",
      "Intensive negotiations continue, requiring Ukrainian and U.S. officials to work across time zones. Each day ushers in proposals and counterproposals.",
      "\u201cThere were likely hundreds of revisions and dozens of draft revisions,\u201d a senior European official close to the talks said. \u201cEvery morning meant a new batch of edits for each side.\u201d",
      "Svyrydenko said on April 18 that the two countries signed a memorandum of intent before a possible fuller agreement later. A draft, dated April 17 and obtained by The Associated Press, called for creating a joint U.S.-Ukraine Reconstruction Investment Fund, incorporated as a partnership in Delaware.",
      "The draft document was a version marked up by the United States and showed that the Trump administration could be willing to cede on some demands that Ukraine opposed.",
      "The draft was notable because it called for the U.S. to make a significant initial cash investment in the fund, in addition to receiving credit in the form of equity that is equivalent to the billions in U.S. military assistance already spent. Earlier versions had the U.S. investing no additional capital in Ukraine while having exclusive rights to the country\u2019s natural resources.",
      "Then, a breakthrough moment came on April 26 in the form of a tete-a-tete between Trump and Zelenskyy in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the sidelines of Pope Francis\u2019 funeral. Zelenskyy described it as a turning point and \u201cthe best conversation\u201d the two leaders have had to date.",
      "The exchange paved the way for the signing of the minerals deal in Washington four days later, he said.",
      "In the end, Zelenskyy didn't get explicit security guarantees as part of the deal. Still, the final agreement was considered a victory for Ukraine after months of diplomatic work.",
      "The signed deal crucially doesn't call for Kyiv to reimburse the U.S. for the aid it has already received \u2014 a concession from Trump. That concession was",
      "That concession was extracted after Ukrainians argued that recognizing past aid as debt retrospectively would go against agreements that Ukraine has made to obtain that aid with the U.S., European Union, International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Deputy Economy Minister Taras Kachka said. Instead, Ukrainians argued for future military assistance to count as part of investment into the fund.",
      "Bessent acknowledged that the agreement was a \u201ctacit security guarantee because of the economic partnership.\u201d",

      "Mason Taylor watched his father finish up a Hall of Fame career with wide eyes and football dreams of his own.",
      "Now, the son of Jason Taylor is a member of the New York Jets \u2014 a second-round draft pick from LSU with famous bloodlines and an opportunity to make an immediate impact in the NFL.",
      "With a chance to step out of one big shadow.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s high expectations, for sure, just because of the last name,\u201d Mason Taylor acknowledged after the Jets' first practice of rookie minicamp Friday. \u201cBut I mean, when people say, like, \u2018Oh, let him have his shine,\u2019 you know, \u2018Stop saying his dad\u2019s name,\u2019 I mean, I love it. We\u2019re family.\"",
      "His father was one of the NFL's greatest pass rushers with 139 1/2 career sacks during a 15-year career. That included 13 seasons with Miami over three stints, one season with Washington and the 2010 season for the Jets \u2014 the last time New York made the playoffs.",
      "Several photos of Mason Taylor \u2014 then 6 years old \u2014 have floated around social media the past few weeks of him at Jets practices and games with a green Mohawk and a green and white No. 99 jersey. There's another of him celebrating his 7th birthday while wearing a No. 6 Mark Sanchez jersey.",
      "\u201cYeah, I mean, seeing the pictures and being here now,\" said Taylor, now wearing No. 46 with the Jets, \u201cis definitely a surreal moment.\u201d",
      "His uncle is Zach Thomas, the brother of Mason's mother and also a Pro Football Hall of Famer. He was also a long-time teammate of Jason with the Dolphins.",
      "\u201cI mean, I\u2019m wanting to be like them,\u201d Mason said. \"So, you can call it \u2018in their shadows,\u2019 but I love modeling my game after theirs, their hard work. I know they were on the defense, but just their hard work and how they weren\u2019t highly recruited coming into the NFL ... their consistency every single day.",
      "\u201cI look up to those guys, for sure.\u201d",
      "Jason Taylor got emotional shortly after his son was drafted, wiping away tears during a video call with reporters when thinking about what it'll be like for him to see Mason playing in the NFL.",
      "Before the young tight end reported for rookie camp with the Jets, he received some advice from his famous father.",
      "\u201cHe actually shot me a text yesterday, last night before our first day today: \u2018Just be where your feet are, take it one step at a time,\u2019\u201d recalled Mason Taylor, who turned 21 on Thursday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s something I\u2019ve done my whole entire life \u2014 just one day at a time, one install at a time, one practice at a time, one workout at a time.",
      "\"So really just being where your feet are, stacking days and that'll show your consistency and then that will get the trust from the coaches and players as well.\u201d",
      "Taylor had 129 catches for 1,308 yards and six TDs in three seasons at LSU, establishing himself as the most productive tight end in school history and one of the top players at his position in the country. He'll be counted on to add another passing option for Justin Fields in the Jets\u2019 new-look offense this season.",
      "New York's tight ends group also includes Jeremy Ruckert, Zack Kuntz, Neal Johnson and Stone Smartt, but Taylor could see significant snaps as a rookie.",
      "\u201cTaking advantage of my opportunity here and the coaches bringing me and trusting me to be a part of their program just speaks to the level of confidence they have in me,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cAnd just giving them all I got on the field for minicamp and showing that in the meetings and weight room and all that is definitely something I\u2019m looking forward to do.\u201d",

      "In more trouble than they faced at any time last year, the Boston Celtics take a 2-0 deficit into Game 3 against the New York Knicks",
      "When the Boston Celtics left New York last month, they had just finished a season sweep of the Knicks that made it seem as if a postseason meeting would be a simple step on their climb back to the NBA Finals.",
      "Now it\u2019s looking like the one that could trip them up.",
      "In more trouble than they faced at any time last year, the defending NBA champions take a 2-0 deficit into Game 3 on Saturday at Madison Square Garden, where ticket prices are soaring as fans hope to be in the building to see the Knicks try to close in on their first Eastern Conference finals appearance in 25 years.",
      "\u201cWe have to go into Saturday\u2019s game and win the game,\u201d Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla said. \u201cThat\u2019s just the way it is. We have to win.\u201d",
      "The Golden State Warriors and Minnesota Timberwolves are tied 1-1 in the other series that resumes Saturday in San Francisco, and they have the prime-time spot on ABC's schedule.",
      "But with Stephen Curry on the sidelines and the Celtics on the ropes, the afternoon appetizer has become the main event.",
      "Boston lost only three games all last postseason. Lose a third straight in this series, and the Celtics would need the biggest comeback in league history to continue their title defense. No NBA team has overcome a 3-0 deficit to win a series.",
      "\u201cThe mentality is 0-0. Don\u2019t even focus on that,\u201d Knicks All-Star Jalen Brunson said. \u201cJust focus on the next play, next quarter and don\u2019t look ahead. Don\u2019t look at anything, just try to focus on the task at hand and be present.\u201d",
      "The Celtics should probably be no worse than tied. They had 20-point leads in the second half of both games in Boston, but both ended with Mikal Bridges making a steal to preserve a Knicks victory.",
      "There hasn't been the same drama in the West series. Minnesota raced to a 13-0 lead and never trailed in its 117-93 victory Thursday, after Golden State led comfortably most of the way in Game 1 even after Curry was lost to a hamstring injury.",
      "\u201cI think both teams are really committed to defense,\" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. \"We for sure have to take all of the easy baskets out of the game. I think we\u2019ll try to figure out a few other things that they\u2019re doing, as you do in a series as it goes along. Of course, defense is going to be huge.\u201d",
      "The Celtics' problem has been their offense. They are 25 for 100 from 3-point range in the series and have averaged just 16.5 points in the fourth quarter. All-Star Jayson Tatum has missed 30 of his 42 shot attempts.",
      "\u201cI take full ownership on the way that I\u2019ve played in this series and can\u2019t sugarcoat anything,\u201d Tatum said. \u201cI need to be better and I expect to be a lot better.\u201d",

      "What to Know: The Knicks blew a 2-0 lead in this same round last year, when the Indiana Pacers came back to beat them in seven games. That is the most recent of the 28 times an NBA team has come back from a 2-0 deficit to win a seven-game series. Five of those came after the team lost the first two games at home, with the Celtics pulling off one of those comebacks in 2017 against Chicago. Boston went 33-8 on the road in the regular season.",

      "Series: Tied, 1-1.",
      "BetMGM Sportsbook: Timberwolves by 5.5.",
      "What to Know: Draymond Green\u2019s temper is something to watch as the series shifts to San Francisco\u2019s Chase Center for the next two games, given the Golden State forward was hit with his fifth technical foul of these playoffs and is two shy of an automatic suspension. Minnesota missed its initial 16 3-point attempts in Game 1 and finished 5 of 29, but the Wolves bounced back to shoot 50.6% overall and 16 for 37 on 3s in Game 2. Warriors coach Steve Kerr\u2019s rotation went 14 deep as he tried various combinations to see who could fill the void with Curry out. Forward Jonathan Kuminga, whose role had diminished down the stretch and didn\u2019t play against Memphis in the play-in game or the regular-season finale, made his first eight shots and scored 18 points on 8-for-11 shooting in 26 minutes. He will surely be needed again along with Trayce Jackson-Davis after he made all six of his field goals and had 15 points and six rebounds.",

I love it. The coaching, my teammates, just the competitiveness, it\u2019s been great. And I\u2019m just looking forward to tomorrow and just take it day by day.\u201d",
      "Hassanein, who was selected in the sixth round with the 196th pick, said one of the biggest moments he's had since arriving at minicamp was meeting coach Dan Campbell.

I would run through a wall for him like I ran through a wall for Coach D (Boise State coach Spencer Danielson).\u201d",
      "As he came out to the practice field, the two finally met and shook hands.",
      "\u201cIt kind of feels unreal,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s an awesome guy. I\u2019m just looking forward to learn from him off the field and on the field.\u201d",
      "It is hoped that Hassanein will help fill the edge rusher hole that the Lions have opposite Aidan Hutchinson.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll say about Ahmed is he\u2019s relentless,\u201d Lions assistant general manager Ray Agnew said Friday. \u201cHe plays the game the way we like to play. He plays it hard. He\u2019s a second-effort rusher. He can win with hands as a rusher. ... And I think when (defensive line ) coach (Kacy) Rodgers get his hands on him to coach him up, the kid\u2019s going to be a good player for us. So we\u2019re excited about him.\u201d",

      "Hassanein, who moved to California in 2018 from Cairo, Egypt, said he has been surprised by the outpouring of attention that he's been receiving from Egyptians.",

      "Man United and Tottenham\u2019s good results in Europe \u2014 while struggling badly in the Premier League \u2014 also contributed to English clubs\u2019 collectively strong season. Chelsea also advanced Thursday to the final of the third-tier Conference League and will play Real Betis.",
      "\u201cThe weight of money in the Premier League means that even malfunctioning teams such as Chelsea, Manchester United and Tottenham have budgets that are multiples of those of the clubs with which they are competing,\u201d said Kieran Maguire, a soccer finance expert from The Price of Football podcast.",

      "The highest Europa League earner last year, Bayer Leverkusen, got 41 million euros ($46 million) and that also should rise for Man United and Tottenham.",
      "It adds up to more money going to England this season, more big-earning chances next season \u2014 with nine teams overall in Europe, compared to just seven from Germany and Italy \u2014 and a virtuous financial circle in the Premier League already awash with money from global broadcast deals.",

      "Chicago Sky star Angel Reese is ready to start winning in the WNBA after setting records as a rookie",
      "CHICAGO -- Angel Reese's rookie year surpassed nearly all expectations.",
      "The Chicago Sky All-Star set records before her season got cut short by an injury and helped the league soar to new heights in popularity after she and the Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark took their rivalry from the college ranks to the pros.",
      "One thing Reese didn't do was win. Not the way she is accustomed to winning. That's something she wants to change, starting with a marquee opener at Indiana on May 17.",
      "\u201cI wasn't used to that,\" Reese said. \"It just takes an adjustment. It's something that you don't want to get used to because you don't want to get in a mindset, like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just going to be losing every night.' We were right there every night.\u201d",
      "The Sky finished 10th in the WNBA with a 13-27 record last season and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2018. The disappointing results were despite getting significant contributions from Reese and fellow rookie Kamilla Cardoso. The two young stars are back, and the team made major roster changes to give them some help.",
      "Chicago fired former coach Teresa Weatherspoon after one year and hired Las Vegas assistant Tyler Marsh to replace the Naismith Hall of Famer.",
      "The Sky also brought in veteran leadership, including franchise career assist leader Courtney Vandersloot and acquiring two-time All-Star Ariel Atkins from Washington. Chicago hopes the additions will help Reese and Cardoso take their games to another level.",
      "\u201cShe wants to compete, she wants to win, she\u2019s somebody that puts that above everything else,\" general manager Jeff Pagliocca said of Reese. \"With all the time that she puts into building her brand and flying all over the world, she still has proven to us time and time again she puts basketball first.",
      "\"Only a competitive player is going to have all these things in her life that are so special but still want to be the greatest player she can be.\u201d",
      "Reese and Clark helped change the landscape of the WNBA, drawing sellout crowds and record ratings while spurring debates about the sport and society. The rivals from LSU and Iowa showcased a style and swagger that captivated the nation when they were going at it in college.",
      "Reese, who finished second to Clark in the Rookie of the Year voting, averaged 13.6 points and a league-record 13.1 rebounds. She set a WNBA record with double-doubles in 15 straight games and finished with 26 on the season \u2014 the most ever by a rookie.",
      "Reese briefly held the mark for total rebounds with 446, only to miss the final six games with a wrist injury. While she was out, league MVP A\u2019ja Wilson finished with 451.",
      "But while the records piled up, so did the losses.",
      "In two seasons at Maryland and two more at LSU, Reese's teams lost a total of 20 games and never dropped more than two in a row. She won an NCAA championship with the Tigers in 2023, beating Clark and Iowa in the final.",
      "The Sky, meanwhile, lost 12 of their final 14 games last season. They dropped seven in a row before beating the Los Angeles Sparks on Sept. 6, only to have Reese suffer a hairline fracture in her left wrist that required surgery. With their star sidelined, they won their next game and lost the final five.",
      "\u201cObviously, that left a bad taste in my mouth,\u201d she said.",
      "Reese had a busy offseason, playing in the Unrivaled 3-on-3 league and trying to increase her range and develop into the sort of stretch power forward the Sky envision her becoming. She shot 39% last season and made just 3 of 16 3-pointers.",
      "\u201cWe want her to be dynamic,\u201d Marsh said. \u201cWe want her to be able to score inside. We want to be able to create space for her to have more one-on-one finishes inside and to not have to have to feel like she's got to play in a crowd. We want to put the ball in her hands on the perimeter and allow her to facilitate and create off the dribble as well.\u201d",
      "Reese said the issue was more her hesitancy to take the shots than her ability to hit shots from the perimeter.",
      "\u201cI always just tell myself if I work out and make the shots I might as well take them in the game,\u201d she said.",
      "Reese got a taste of the championship atmosphere when she sat courtside during the WNBA finals between New York and Minnesota. She showed up for Game 5 wearing what looked like a custom outfit split down the middle with a Liberty jersey on her left side and Lynx jersey on the right.",
      "Reese also excelled in Unrivaled. Her team Rose BC won the championship, though she missed the playoffs after hurting her surgically repaired wrist. She likes the makeup of the Sky and believes Chicago will be difficult to beat.",

      "MUMBAI, India -- India\u2019s biggest domestic cricket tournament was suspended for one week on Friday following the escalating military tensions with Pakistan.",
      "The Indian Premier League, which attracts top players from around the world, was halted with immediate effect, the Board of Control for Cricket in India said.",
      "\u201cFurther updates regarding the new schedule and venues of the tournament will be announced in due course after a comprehensive assessment of the situation in consultation with relevant authorities and stakeholders,\u201d the BCCI said in a statement.",
      "The decision comes after a night of artillery exchanges between Indian and Pakistani soldiers across their frontier in Kashmir, amid a growing military standoff that erupted following an attack on tourists in the India-controlled portion of the disputed region.",
      "The IPL is the most popular cricket tournament in the world and runs between March and May. This year it has featured 65 international cricketers from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Sri Lanka, West Indies, England and Afghanistan.",

      "The suspension comes after the match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in Dharamsala in northern India was abandoned on Thursday evening when the power went out during a government mandated blackout. Punjab's next game against Mumbai Indians had already been moved from Dharamsala to Mumbai because of the closure of several airports in the Indian northwestern corridor.",
      "Pakistan earlier said it was moving its own domestic T20 tournament to the United Arab Emirates because of the tensions. The PCB confirmed the relocation of the Pakistan Super League to Dubai in a statement released early Friday, citing growing concerns among overseas players and the need to prioritize their safety.",

      "Even though Desmond Watson is trying to make Tampa Bay\u2019s roster, he\u2019s already made history \u2014 as the NFL\u2019s heaviest player.",
      "The 6-foot-6, 464-pound defensive tackle from Florida signed with his hometown Buccaneers after going undrafted and will begin his NFL journey during Tampa Bay\u2019s three-day rookie minicamp that opens Friday. He\u2019s sure to get plenty of attention \u2014 maybe even as much as the team\u2019s first-round draft pick, former Ohio State receiver Emeka Egbuka.",
      "The Bucs would no doubt like to see Watson a little lighter on his feet. The Gators struggled for four years to make tangible progress with a guy Florida coach Billy Napier called \u201ca unicorn\u201d and \u201cjust a big man.\u201d",
      "While no current NFL player tops 400 pounds \u2014 Baltimore Ravens guard Daniel Faalele is the heaviest at 380 \u2014 there have been a few who have played at or near four bills. Here\u2019s a look at some of the beefiest guys in league history:",
      "A first-round draft pick by Detroit in 1999, Gibson started 15 games for the Lions before getting waived in the middle of his third season. Shoulder issues landed the offensive tackle on injured reserve in each of his first two years. He also played with Dallas and Chicago before getting one final shot in the NFL with Buffalo in 2006; the Bills cut him near the end of training camp. He bounced around the Arena Football League from there. He battled depression after his playing days ended and weighed as much as 480 pounds.",
      "The 6-foot-10 Brown signed with the St. Louis Rams as an undrafted rookie from Mississippi in 2013. He showed up 15 pounds heavier than then-Rams coach Jeff Fisher expected. He shed some weight during training camp \u2014 the Rams had him playing right tackle after working him on both sides of the ball \u2014 but he didn\u2019t make the team.",
      "Cut by Washington before spending two years (1984-85) in the USFL, Newton\u2019s career changed dramatically when he signed with the Dallas Cowboys. Nicknamed \u201cThe Kitchen\u201d because of his size, Newton lost a footrace with then-Cowboys coach Jimmy Johnson that pushed him to get into better shape. He ended up becoming one of the league\u2019s most dominant guards in the 1990s. He made six Pro Bowls while blocking for Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman and helped the Cowboys win three Super Bowls. Newton was back over 400 pounds in retirement, but he eventually lost nearly half his body weight thanks to stomach surgery in 2010.",
      "Despite weighing as much as 450 pounds as a two-way player at Bethel University of the NAIA, Buffalo drafted Jasper in the seventh round in 2011. He dropped to 375 pounds during training camp but was released in final cuts. He landed on Buffalo\u2019s practice squad but never played in a regular-season game. He\u2019s now the head coach at Stetson.",
      "McKinnie played in 179 games, with 162 starts, over a 12-year NFL career. A college standout at Miami and the seventh overall pick by Minnesota in 2002, McKinnie\u2019s 6-foot-8 frame handled the weight well. He made the Pro Bowl in 2009 and won the Super Bowl with Baltimore following the 2012 season.",
      "A first-round draft pick by Chicago in 1985, Perry quickly earned the nickname \u201cThe Refrigerator\u201d and became a fan favorite as a rookie. The run-stuffing nose tackle also carried five times for 7 yards and two touchdowns in the regular season and had a TD catch. His bone-jarring TD run \u2014 and subsequent spike \u2014 against New England in the 1986 Super Bowl remains an iconic moment in NFL lore. He finished his pro career with 524 tackles, including 29 1/2 sacks, over 138 games. The Fridge may have gained popularity in retirement: He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame and participated as a celebrity contestant in the 2003 Nathan\u2019s Hot Dog Eating Contest.",

      "The Golden Knights scored the only goal in the first period on Olofsson's power-play shot from the right circle. Eichel set up the play by passing to Stone, who from below the goal found an open Olofsson for his first career playoff goal.",
      "Edmonton rolled off three goals in a row in the second period \u2014 all from distance. The Golden Knights quickly responded with Karlsson's redirect of Eichel's shot with 1:50 left in the period cut it to to 3-2.",
      "The Oilers, who trailed 1-0 after one period, have a record six consecutive comeback victories in a single postseason.",
      "Vegas has never been swept in its eight-year history and even rallied from 2-0 down in 2021 to beat Colorado in six games, though that series began on the road. The Golden Knights also have been eliminated in five games just twice, including the 2018 Stanley Cup Final against Washington.",
      "The Golden Knights\u2019 42-game playoff winning streak when scoring at least three goals ended. It was the second longest in NHL history to Montreal\u2019s 52-game streak in 1945-57, according to Sportradar.",

      "Shohei Ohtani hit a solo homer in the ninth \u2014 his 11th long ball of the season \u2014 but the Dodgers have now dropped three of their past five games.",
      "Yamamoto (4-3) came into the game with an 0.90 ERA, which led the big leagues, but ran into trouble in the fourth. Pavin Smith walked, Josh Naylor singled and Eugenio Su\u00e1rez was hit by a pitch with no outs before Moreno drove a cutter to right, barely clearing the fence for his first homer of the season.",
      "Ketel Marte added a solo homer in the fifth to make it 5-0. Kevin Ginkel worked the ninth for his first save of the year.",
      "Pfaadt (6-2) continued his stellar start to the season, giving up four hits, walking three and striking out six. Yamamoto gave up five runs on six hits and a walk, striking out four.",

      "The Dodgers were threatening in the eighth before Marte started a spectacular double play to end the threat. The second baseman ranged to his left and snagged Conforto's grounder before wheeling and firing to Geraldo Perdomo at second, whose throw to Naylor at first was just in time.",
      "The Diamondbacks won their 20th game of the year. The NL West is the only division that has four teams with 20-plus wins. The other team is the Colorado Rockies, who are 6-31.",
      "RHP Roki Sasaki (1-1, 3.86 ERA) will start for the Dodgers against LHP Eduardo Rodriguez (1-3, 5.92) and the Diamondbacks on Friday night.",

      "Nickeil Alexander-Walker added 20 points to spearhead a superb performance by the bench, combining with Donte DiVincenzo and Naz Reid to go 10 for 22 from deep.",

      "Jonathan Kuminga (18 points) and Trayce Jackson-Davis (15) combined to shoot 14 for 17 from the floor for the Warriors. They took nearly five minutes to score, finally breaking through down 13-0 on Jimmy Butler's 3-pointer.",
      "With the NBA's career leading 3-point shooter next to him on the bench, coach Steve Kerr used a kitchen-sink experiment with 14 players getting time.",
      "\u201cBut I would still like to win,\u201d Butler said. \u201cI think the biggest lesson is don\u2019t start off in a hole like we did tonight, and the game maybe could have ended up a little bit differently.\u201d",
      "Kuminga, the seventh overall pick in the 2021 draft who dropped out of the rotation at times during the regular season and missed significant time with a sprained right ankle, was a bright spot off the bench. But this Warriors team was already thin on offense with a healthy Curry.",
      "\u201cWe have to figure out what we\u2019re going to be able to do in this series without Steph,\" Kerr said. \u201cSo we gave a lot of people a lot of chances, and some guys really stepped up.\u201d",
      "Against the Wolves and their athletic, long and versatile defense, there wasn't much to lean on. Without Curry to worry about, the Wolves had an easier time keeping shooters Buddy Hield and Brandin Podziemski quiet.",
      "The Warriors put up their lowest first-quarter score (15) in the playoffs since Game 6 of the 2016 NBA Finals, according to Sportradar, when they had 11 in a loss to Cleveland.",

      "\u201cThe guys obviously revere Steph, and they love his presence and that'll matter to us tonight during the game,\u201d coach Steve Kerr said in his pregame interview. \u201cI'm sure he'll be talking to the guys on the sidelines and giving some thoughts. He may come into our huddle and make a suggestion, which I always welcome, so it's good to have him here for sure.\u201d",
      "At one point, when Green picked up his fifth technical foul of the playoffs, two short of an automatic one-game suspension, Curry was concerned enough about his pal getting ejected for a second technical that he went over to the scorer's table to try to talk Green down and walk him back to the bench.",
      "But not having Curry on the court clearly hurt.",
      "\u201cEverybody knows it\u2019s difficult to recreate or even get close to doing what he does, but we\u2019re going to have to find a way,\u201d Butler said. \"So we\u2019ll go to the tapes, talk about it and execute it to the best of our abilities.\u201d",

      "Mikko Rantanen is on a history-making tear",
      "Mikko Rantanen is on a history-making tear. The Florida Panthers need a history-making comeback.",
      "The Toronto Maple Leafs will seek a 3-0 lead in their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the defending Stanley Cup champion Panthers on Friday night, while Rantanen \u2014 on a scoring roll the likes of which hockey hasn't seen in generations \u2014 will lead the Dallas Stars into Game 2 of their Western Conference semifinal series against the Winnipeg Jets.",
      "Florida lost a pair of one-goal games at Toronto to open their series, which resumes on the Panthers' home ice for Game 3 on Friday.",
      "History says the Panthers are in big trouble: Toronto has won all 11 of its previous best-of-seven series when taking a 2-0 lead at home, Florida is 0-5 all-time in series where it dropped both Games 1 and 2, and leaguewide, teams facing 0-2 deficits come back to win those series only about 14% of the time.",
      "There are no magic words to say now, Panthers coach Paul Maurice said Thursday.",
      "\u201cIf there was, you would have said it two games ago, right? We\u2019re not holding back any gems,\" Maurice said. \"That's probably the most important thing that you realize. We went on the road and lost two one-goal games. Our game\u2019s not perfect. Neither is theirs. So, you\u2019re looking for an adjustment to foundation more than an adjustment to something unusual.\u201d",
      "Over in the West, where Dallas stuck first in Winnipeg with a 3-2 win, Rantanen is indeed doing something unusual \u2014 lots of things that are unusual, actually.",
      "He's the third player in NHL playoff history to have a hat trick in back-to-back games: Jari Kurri for Edmonton in 1985 and Doug Bentley for Chicago in 1944 are the others. He's had a hand in each of Dallas' last 12 goals, a streak unmatched by any player on any team in playoff history. He's the first player in playoff history with at least eight goals and six assists in a four-game span. The first player with two three-goal periods in the same postseason. And on, and on, and on.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s see how long he can run this for,\" Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. \"He\u2019s rolling. He's feeling it. Pretty impressive, what he\u2019s doing. I mean, considering the opponent and the time of year and how he\u2019s dominating games, really impressive.\u201d",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 3, Friday, 7 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max)",
      "Series: Maple Leafs lead 2-0",
      "If losing a pair of one-goal playoff games wasn't bad enough \u2014 5-4 in Game 1, 4-3 in Game 2 \u2014 the Panthers can look at two goals given up in those games and really lament how those scores factored into creating their current situation.",
      "In Game 1, Seth Jones scored to get Florida within 2-1 \u2014 and the Panthers gave up a goal to Morgan Rielly 19 seconds later. In Game 2, Anton Lundell scored early in the third to pull Florida into a 3-3 tie \u2014 only to have Mitch Marner score what became the game-winner 17 seconds later.",
      "The Leafs held serve at home, which is what they were supposed to do. Toronto became the first team to get to six wins in these playoffs and will be feeling very good about its game going into Game 3.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t change how we go about our day today,\" Panthers forward Sam Reinhart said Thursday before Florida hopped aboard its charter flight back home. \"It\u2019s about recovering and putting the best foot forward to play our best game tomorrow night and get back in this thing.\u201d",
      "When/Where to Watch: Game 2, Friday, 9:30 p.m. EDT (TNT/truTV/Max)",
      "Series: Stars lead 1-0",
      "Playoff hockey is different. Every opponent at this time of year is obviously proven. But the Winnipeg Jets \u2014 who needed seven games and a Game 7 miracle to escape St. Louis in Round 1 \u2014 are right back into some hot water, in large part because they're giving up a lot of goals.",
      "The Jets have given up 26 goals in the last six games, after not giving up more than 20 in any six-game span of the regular season.",
      "Rantanen's hot streak is one thing, but Winnipeg's defense wasn't exactly airtight going back to Round 1 either. And while the Jets survived a Game 7 at home to get here, the last thing they need is to go back to Dallas in a 2-0 hole.",
      "That starts with doing more against Rantanen.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s just somebody that you always have to know when he\u2019s on the ice,\" Jets coach Scott Arniel said of facing Rantanen. \u201cWhenever you face elite players, you\u2019ve got to know where they are.

      "For Mike Sullivan, the latest coach of the New York Rangers, there will be many priorities in taking over a team that missed the playoffs a season after winning the Presidents\u2019 Trophy.",
      "Foremost will be communication.",
      "\u201cI have spoken to every player on the roster over the last three days,\u2019\u2019 Sullivan said Thursday at his introductory press conference. \u201cI think there is a fair amount of leadership in that room. There\u2019s a lot of character in that room.\u201d",
      "Sullivan, the 38th coach in franchise history and fifth since 2018, agreed to lead the Rangers on May 2 after parting ways with Pittsburgh, where he won the Stanley Cup twice.",
      "He replaces Peter Laviolette, who was fired April 19 after the Rangers slid 29 points to miss the postseason despite their raft of talent. It will be up to Sullivan to resuscitate a power play that fell from the league\u2019s top echelon to 28th overall in 2024-25 and help the defense improve in front of elite goaltender Igor Shesterkin, who is coming off his worst NHL season.",
      "Sullivan spent four seasons as a Rangers assistant under then-coach John Tortorella from 2009-13. He also coached current Rangers president and general manager Chris Drury during that time. They also worked together through USA Hockey at the 4 Nations Face-Off last February and will be part of the U.S. contingent for the 2026 Milan Olympics.",
      "Sullivan will have top scorers Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad and Adam Fox on his side after years guiding Penguins stars Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang in Pittsburgh, where he won the Cup in 2016 and 2017.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve grown so much respect over the years for the talent that the Rangers have,\u2019\u2019 said Sullivan, who lost a seven-game first-round playoff series to the Rangers in 2022. \"I look forward to the opportunity to get to know these guys on a more personal level. I look forward to the opportunity to work with them, both on the ice and off the ice, to try to become the most competitive team that we can become.\u201d",
      "Also pressing for the 57-year-old Sullivan \u2014 who was drafted by the Rangers in 1987 and later played 709 NHL games for four other franchises \u2014 is how he will handle younger Rangers such as 22-year-old Brennan Othmann and 20-year-old Gabe Perreault, a first-round pick in 2023 who joined the team briefly at the end of last season.",
      "\u201cPart of coaching or the art of coaching, I guess, is trying to figure out what that daily recipe is that\u2019s best for the player,\u2019\u2019 Sullivan said. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s time in the American League as a young player, sometimes it\u2019s time in the National League depending on the types of minutes that that player can play. What I will tell you is that I think it\u2019s important that every player earns their opportunities, that no one\u2019s entitled to an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Sullivan was joined Thursday by Drury, who was awarded a contract extension last month.",
      "Drury\u2019s previous two coaching hires \u2014 Laviolette and Gerard Gallant \u2014 each lasted two seasons. The 48-year-old executive expressed enthusiasm for the addition of Sullivan, the only U.S.-born coach with multiple Stanley Cup wins.",
      "\u201cThe second Mike was available, we quickly and aggressively pursued him,\u2019\u2019 Drury said. \u201cWe are certainly thrilled that pursuit led us to this moment today. There\u2019s a lot of work to be done.\u201d",

      "What appeared next stunned those in the Phoenix courtroom last week: An AI-generated video with a likeness of her brother, Christopher Pelkey, told the shooter he was forgiven.",
      "The judge said he loved and appreciated the video, then sentenced the shooter to 10.5 years in prison \u2014 the maximum sentence and more than what prosecutors sought. Within hours of the hearing on May 1, the defendant's lawyer filed a notice of appeal.",
      "Defense attorney Jason Lamm won't be handling the appeal, but said a higher court will likely be asked to weigh in on whether the judge improperly relied on the AI-generated video when sentencing his client.",
      "Courts across the country have been grappling with how to best handle the increasing presence of artificial intelligence in the courtroom. Even before Pelkey\u2019s family used AI to give him a voice for the victim impact portion \u2014 believed to be a first in U.S. courts \u2014 the Arizona Supreme Court created a committee that researches best AI practices.",
      "In Florida, a judge recently donned a virtual reality headset meant to show the point of view of a defendant who said he was acting in self-defense when he waved a loaded gun at wedding guests. The judge rejected his claim.",

      "AI can be very persuasive, Harris said, and scholars are studying the intersection of the technology and manipulation tactics.",
      "Cynthia Godsoe, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former public defender, said as this technology continues to push the boundaries of traditional legal practices, courts will have to confront questions they have never before had to weigh: Does this AI photograph really match the witness's testimony? Does this video exaggerate the suspect's height, weight, or skin color?",
      "\u201cIt's definitely a disturbing trend,\" she said, \u201cbecause it could veer even more into fake evidence that maybe people don't figure out is false.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt also says something about the family,\" he said. \u201cBecause you told me how angry you were, and you demanded the maximum sentence, and even though that's what you wanted, you allowed Chris to speak from his heart as you saw it.\u201d",

      "Previous research has shown that chimps have their own signature drumming style. A new analysis of 371 bouts of chimpanzee drumming demonstrates that the chimps \u201cclearly play their instruments -- the tree trunks -- with regular rhythms,\u201d said University of Amsterdam music cognition researcher Henkjan Honing, who was not involved in the study.",
      "When bounding through the jungle, chimps will often grab hold of the tall buttress roots of rainforest trees. Sometimes they pound them several times to create low-frequency sounds that can be heard for a kilometer or more through the forest.",
      "Scientists believe that the drumming is a form of long-distance communication, perhaps to alert other chimps where one chimp is waiting or the direction it is traveling.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a way of socially checking in,\u201d said Hobaiter, adding that each chimp has its own \u201cindividual signature \u2014 a pattern of beats that allows you to recognize who\u2019s producing that drumming.\u201d",
      "The new work showed that chimps from different regions of Africa drum with distinctly different rhythms, with western chimps preferring a more even beat while eastern chimps used varied short and long intervals between beats. The research was published Friday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "It's well-known that chimps use tools such as rocks to crack open nuts and sticks to \u201cfish\u201d termites from their mounds. Tree roots can also be tools, the researchers say.",
      "Chimps are selective about which roots they pound, said co-author Catherine Crockford, a primatologist at the CNRS Institute for Cognitive Sciences in France. Certain shapes and wood varieties create sounds that travel well through dense jungle.",

      "Built to land on the solar system's hottest planet, the titanium-covered spacecraft may survive its fiery, uncontrolled plunge through Earth's atmosphere, predicted to occur on Saturday. But experts said it likely would come down over water, covering most of the world, or a desolate region.",
      "The odds of it slamming into a populated area are \u201cinfinitesimally small,\u201d said University of Colorado Boulder scientist Marcin Pilinski.",
      "\u201cWhile we can anticipate that most of this object will not burn up in the atmosphere during reentry, it may be severely damaged on impact,\" Pilinski said in an email.",
      "By Friday, all indications pointed to a reentry early Saturday morning, U.S. Eastern Time, give or take several hours. While space debris trackers around the world converged in their forecasts, it was still too soon to know exactly when and where the spacecraft known as Kosmos 482 would come down. That uncertainty was due to potential solar activity and the spacecraft\u2019s old condition. Its parachutes were expected to be useless by now and its batteries long dead.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek estimated the impact speed at 150 mph (242 kph) if the spacecraft remains intact.",

      "WASHINGTON -- OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and executives from Microsoft and chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices testified on Capitol Hill about the biggest opportunities, risks and needs facing an industry which lawmakers and technologists agree could fundamentally transform global business, culture and geopolitics.",
      "The hearing comes as the race to control the future of artificial intelligence is heating up between companies and countries. Altman's OpenAI is in a furious race to develop the best artificial intelligence model against tech rivals like Alphabet and Meta, as well as against those developed by Chinese competitors.",
      "\u201cI believe this will be at least as big as the internet, maybe bigger,\u201d Altman said in his opening remarks about AI\u2019s potential to transform society. \u201cFor that to happen, investment in infrastructure is critical.\u201d Altman urged senators to help usher in the \u201cdual revolutions\u201d of artificial intelligence and energy production that \u201cwill change the world we live in, I think, in incredibly positive ways.\u201d",
      "The witnesses included Altman; Lisa Su, chief executive of semiconductor maker AMD; Michael Intrator, co-founder of AI cloud computing startup CoreWeave; and Brad Smith, vice chair and president of Microsoft. They four executives unanimously urged lawmakers to help streamline policy for AI-related projects and fundraising.",
      "The hearing spanned topics ranging from industry debates over chip performance, jobs, human relationships and power generation to grander questions about the global competition with China and the European Union.",
      "\u201cChina aims to lead the world in AI by 2030,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. \u201cIn this race, the United States is facing a fork in the road. Do we go down the path that embraces our history of entrepreneurial freedom and technological innovation? Or do we adopt the command and control policies of Europe?\u201d",
      "Senators were broadly sober in their questioning and united in their concern that the U.S. maintain its dominance in artificial intelligence. Lawmakers from both parties also raised concerns over cybersecurity, data privacy and AI's ability to create content that could confuse or mislead people.",
      "Some partisan fighting did arise. Sen. Bernie Moreno, an Ohio Republican, pressed Su and Smith on whether the Biden administration\u2019s sustainable energy policies hindered the goal of producing more power for AI-related infrastructure.",
      "And Sen. Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, criticized cuts by President Donald Trump and billionaire Elon Musk to federal funding for research and to agencies like the Energy Department\u2019s national laboratories and National Science Foundation, painting them as \u201ca self sabotaging attack.\u201d",
      "\u201cDoes anyone truly have confidence that had DOGE been around decades ago, they would not have cut the project that created the internet as an example of wasteful, publicly funded research and development?\u201d asked Duckworth.",
      "But despite some barbs, the hearing maintained a low-key tenor and some bipartisan joking as lawmakers and executives discussed the potential of a technology all present agreed would determine humanity's future.",
      "\u201cLook, there is a race, but we need to understand what we\u2019re racing for,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, told the witnesses. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a sort of commercial race, so we can edge out our nearest competitor in the public sector or the private sector. We\u2019re trying to win a race so that American values prevail.\u201d",
      "Several of the executives warned against U.S. export controls that could end up pushing other countries toward China\u2019s AI technology.",
      "\u201cWe totally understand as an industry the importance of national security,\u201d Su said. But she added, if not able to \u201chave our technology adopted in the rest of the world, there will be other technologies that will come to play.\u201d Those technologies are less advanced today but will mature over time, she said.",
      "Altman drew a direct connection between the United State's ability to attract global talent and ability to sell its products globally to national security and its international influence.",
      "\u201cThe leverage and the power the U.S. gets from having iPhones be the mobile device people most want, and Google being the search engine that people most want around the world is huge,\u201d Altman said. \u201cWe talk maybe less about how much people want to use chips and other infrastructure developed here, but I think it\u2019s no less important, and we should aim to have the entire U.S. stack be adopted by as much of the world as possible.\u201d",
      "Trade rivalry between the U.S. and China has been weighing heavily on the AI industry, including California-based chipmakers Nvidia and AMD.",
      "The Trump administration announced in April that it would restrict sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips and AMD\u2019s MI308 chips to China.",
      "Nvidia has said the tighter export controls will cost the company an extra $5.5 billion. AMD said after reporting its quarterly earnings this week that it will cost the firm $1.5 billion in lost revenue over the coming months.",
      "Still uncertain are the effects on additional AI chip controls set by former President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that are set to take effect next week targeting more than 100 countries. The policy drew strong opposition from Nvidia and other tech companies, while it was supported by others, including AI company Anthropic, as a way to prevent China\u2019s \u201csophisticated smuggling operations\u201d to obtain chips from shell companies in third countries.",
      "The Commerce Department said in an email Thursday that Trump plans to replace Biden\u2019s \u201coverly complex, overly bureaucratic\u201d rule with a simpler one but didn\u2019t say when.",
      "The day before the hearing, Altman visited the Abilene, Texas, site of the massive Stargate data center project being built for OpenAI in collaboration with Oracle and other partners. The site was chosen for its potential access to a variety of energy resources, including wind and solar power.",
      "Altman, during the hearing, said that Texas had been \u201cunbelievable\" in incentivizing major AI projects. \u201cI think that would be a good thing for other states to study,\u201d Altman said. He predicted that the Abilene site would be the \u201clargest AI training facility in the world.\u201d",
      "But Altman also later cautioned against a patchwork regulatory framework for AI.",
      "\u201cIt is very difficult to imagine us figuring out how to comply with 50 different sets of regulations,\u201d said Altman. \u201cOne federal framework that is light touch, that we can understand, and it lets us move with the speed that this moment calls for, seems important and fine.\u201d",
      "While the tech industry has long relied on data centers to run online services, from email and social media to financial transactions, new AI technology behind popular chatbots and generative AI tools requires even more powerful computation to build and operate.",
      "A report released by the Department of Energy late last year estimated that the electricity needed for data centers in the U.S. tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple again by 2028 when it could consume up to 12% of the nation\u2019s electricity.",

      "New experiments show eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Eggs are less likely to crack when they fall on their side, according to experiments with over 200 eggs.",
      "What does this mean for the best way to crack an egg for breakfast? Not much, since a break around the middle is the best way to get the golden yolk and runny whites to ooze out.",
      "But scientists said it could help with hard-boiling eggs in a pot: Dropping eggs in horizontally may be less likely to cause a stray crack that can unleash the egg's insides in a puffy, cloudy mess.",
      "It's commonly thought that eggs are strongest at their ends \u2014 after all, it's how they're packaged in the carton. The thinking is that the arc-shaped bottom of an egg redirects the force and softens the blow of impact.",
      "But when scientists squeezed eggs in both directions during a compression test, they cracked under the same amount of force.",
      "\u201cThe fun started when we thought we would get one result and then we saw another,\u201d said Hudson Borja da Rocha with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped run the experiments.",
      "The researchers also ran simulations and dropped eggs horizontally and vertically from three short heights up to 0.4 inches (10 millimeters).",
      "The egg result? The ones dropped horizontally cracked less .",
      "\u201cThe common sense is that the egg in the vertical direction is stronger than if you lay the egg down. But they proved that's not the case,\u201d said materials scientist Marc Meyers with the University of California, San Diego who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found that the egg's equator was more flexible and absorbed more of the energy of the fall before cracking. The findings were published Thursday in the journal Communications Physics.",
      "Eggs are also usually nestled top-down into homemade contraptions for egg drop challenges as part of school STEM projects, which partially inspired the new study. It's not yet clear whether the new results will help protect these vulnerable eggs, which are dropped at much loftier heights.",
      "It's a bit counterintuitive that the oblong side of an egg could hold up better against a tumble, said study co-author Tal Cohen with Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",
      "Countless broken eggs show \"the courage to go and challenge these very common, accepted notions,\u201d Cohen said.",

      "More than a dozen states are suing the Trump administration for withholding funds from for the buildout of electric vehicle chargers across the U.S. The federal lawsuit says $5 billion allocated to states under the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law signed ...",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Seventeen states are suing President Donald Trump 's administration for withholding billions of dollars for building more electric vehicle chargers, according to a federal lawsuit announced Wednesday.",
      "The Trump administration in February directed states to stop spending money for electric vehicle charging infrastructure that was allocated under President Joe Biden \u2014 part of a broader push by the Republican president to roll back environmental policies advanced by his Democratic predecessor. The EV charger program was set to allocate $5 billion over five years to various states, of which an estimated $3.3 billion had already been made available.",
      "The lawsuit is led by attorneys general from California, Colorado and Washington, and challenges the Federal Highway Administration's authority to halt the funding. They argue Congress, which approved the money in 2021 as part of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, holds that authority.",
      "\"These funds were going to be used to shape the future of transportation,\u201d California Attorney General Rob Bonta said, calling it \u201cshort-sighted\u201d of Trump to revoke the funds.",
      "\u201cWe won\u2019t sit back while the Trump administration violates the law,\u201d Bonta, a Democrat, said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "EVs stood at about 8% of new car sales in the U.S. last year, according to Motorintelligence.com, a sign the market is growing \u2014 although the pace has slowed as the auto industry tries to convince mainstream buyers about going electric. The program was meant to assuage some concerns and build infrastructure along highway corridors first, then address gaps elsewhere once the state highway obligations were met.",
      "Some states with projects running under the program have already been reimbursed by the Biden-era federal funds. Others are still contracting for their sites. Still more had halted their plans by the time the Trump administration ordered states to stop their spending. Regardless, getting these chargers installed and operating has been a slow process with contracting challenges, permitting delays and complex electrical upgrades.",
      "It was expected that states would fight against the federal government\u2019s efforts to slow the nation\u2019s electric vehicle charger buildout. New York, for example, which is part of the suit, has been awarded over $175 million in federal funds from the program, and state officials say $120 million is currently being withheld by the Trump administration.",
      "Even the electric carmaker Tesla, run by Elon Musk, who has spearheaded Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency efforts to cut federal spending, benefited greatly from funding under the program, receiving millions of dollars to expand its already-massive footprint of chargers in the U.S.",
      "Despite threats to the program, experts have said they expect the nation\u2019s EV charging buildout to continue as automakers look to make good on massive electrification ambitions.",
      "Consumers thinking about buying an EV often cite concerns about the availability of charging infrastructure. It's a hurdle for people living in multifamily dwellings and in rural areas, or what are otherwise known as \u201ccharging deserts.\u201d It's also a problem for people who can't find a place to charge their vehicle near their work, or who often drive longer highway routes.",
      "Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said withholding the funds was illegal and would kill thousands of U.S. jobs, ceding them to China.",
      "\"Instead of hawking Teslas on the White House lawn, President Trump could actually help Elon \u2014 and the nation \u2014 by following the law and releasing this bipartisan funding,\u201d Newsom said, referencing Trump's recent purchase of a Tesla in a show of support for Musk.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s effort to withdraw funding for electric vehicle chargers is part of a broader push to roll back environmental policies advanced under Biden.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first week back in office, he signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement again, reverse a 2030 target for electric vehicles to make up half of new cars sold, and end environmental justice efforts. At the same time, federal agencies under Trump have rolled back key rules and regulations and supported the build-out of the fossil fuel industry.",
      "The U.S. House also advanced proposals last week aimed at blocking California from enforcing vehicle-emission rules, including a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. The Senate parliamentarian says the California policies are not subject to the review mechanism used by the House.",

      "A new study out in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment finds that wildfires fueled by climate change are linked to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic burden",
      "Wildfires driven by climate change contribute to as many as thousands of annual deaths and billions of dollars in economic costs from wildfire smoke in the United States, according to a new study.",
      "The paper, published Friday in the journal Nature Communications Earth & Environment, found that from 2006 to 2020, climate change contributed to about 15,000 deaths from exposure to small particulate matter from wildfires and cost about $160 billion. The annual range of deaths was 130 to 5,100, the study showed, with the highest in states such as Oregon and California.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot more of these wildfire smoke events,\u201d said Nicholas Nassikas, a study author and a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. So he and multidisciplinary team of researchers wanted to know: \"What does it really mean in a changing environment for things like mortality, which is kind of the worst possible health outcome?\u201d",
      "Lisa Thompson, a professor at Emory University who studies air pollution and climate change and was not involved in the paper, said it is one of the first studies she has seen to isolate the effect of climate change on mortality. Looking at the impacts across time and space also made it unique, she said.",
      "The paper's researchers focused on deaths linked to exposure to fine particulate matter, or PM2.5 \u2014 the main concern from wildfire smoke.",
      "These particles can lodge deep into lungs and trigger coughing and itchy eyes with short-term exposure. But longer term they can make existing health problems worse and lead to a range of chronic and deadly health issues. Children, pregnant people, the elderly and outdoor workers are among the most vulnerable. The Health Effects Institute estimated the pollutant caused 4 million deaths worldwide.",
      "Evidence is emerging that PM2.5 from wildfire smoke is more toxic than other pollution sources. When wildfires encroach into cities, burning cars and other toxics-containing materials, it adds to the danger.",
      "Numerous studies have tied human-caused climate change \u2014 caused by the burning of coal, oil and gas \u2014 to a growth in fires in North America. Global warming is increasing drought, especially in the West, and other extreme weather. Drier conditions suck moisture from plants, which act as fuel for fires. When drier vegetation and seasons are mixed with hotter temperatures, that increases the frequency, extent and severity of wildfires and the smoke they spew.",
      "Jacob Bendix, professor emeritus of geography and environment at Syracuse University, said he was \u201cdismayed\u201d by the findings but not surprised.",
      "\u201c(T) hese numbers are really significant. I think there\u2019s a tendency for people outside of the areas actually burning to see increasing fires as a distant inconvenience \u2026 This study drives home how far-reaching the impacts are,\u201d said Bendix in an email. He wasn't involved in the study.",
      "The study\u2019s authors drew on modeled and existing data to reach their findings. First, they sought to understand how much area burned by wildfires was attributable to climate change. They did that by analyzing the real climate conditions \u2014 heat and rain, for instance \u2014 when wildfires erupted from 2006 to 2020, and compared that to a scenario where weather measurements would be different without climate change.",
      "From there, they estimated the levels of PM2.5 from wildfire smoke tied to climate change using the same approach. Lastly, integrating the current understanding of how particulate matter affects mortality based on published research, they quantified the number of deaths related to PM2.5 from wildfires and calculated their economic impact.",
      "This framework showed that of 164,000 deaths related to wildfire-PM2.5 exposure from 2006 to 2020, 10% were attributable to climate change. The mortalities were 30% to 50% higher in some western states and counties.",
      "Marshall Burke, global environmental policy professor at Stanford University, said the evidence linking climate change to burned areas was \u201crock solid,\u201d but the subsequent steps were harder.",
      "\u201cLinking burned area to smoke is trickier because you never know exactly which way the wind\u2019s going to blow,\u201d he said, and he wondered how the death estimates compared to fatalities tied to general air pollution.",
      "Still, their approach was sensible and reasonable, Burke said.",
      "Johns Hopkins University lecturer in climate and energy policy Patrick Brown said he had some concerns about the study. One was conceptual. The study acknowledges the power non-climate drivers have on wildfires, but it doesn't give them proper weight, he said in an email.",
      "Brown, who was not involved in the study, worries decision-makers could wrongly conclude that mitigating planet-warming carbon emissions is the only solution. \u201cYet in many regions, the more immediate life\u2011saving action may be fuel breaks, prescribed burns, ignition\u2011source regulation, public health efforts, etc.,\u201d he said.",
      "Land management practices such as prescribed burns can reduce wildfire fuel, Nassikas said. But ultimately, the study notes, the problem of deaths from wildfire smoke will only get worse without the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\u201cPart of the study is raising awareness,\" he said. \u201cAnd then once we kind of understand that \u2026 now what are the interventions that we can deploy at a personal level, at a community level, and then obviously at a larger level across the country and across the world?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Skype users are scrambling to find an alternative after Microsoft shut down the pioneering internet phone service which let people make cheap long distance calls and chat with other users",
      "LONDON -- Skype is dead. What now?",
      "Microsoft's shutdown of Skype on May 5 sent millions of users scrambling to find an alternative to the pioneering internet phone service.",
      "Skype, which Microsoft bought in 2011, was beloved by a dwindling group of users who appreciated how it let them make cheap long-distance calls as well as communicate with other users through chat messages, voice or video calls.",
      "Some liked its simplicity and ease of use \u2014 an advantage, for example, when setting up a communications app for an elderly parent living far away.",
      "Or they just used it out of habit.",
      "Skype was founded in 2003 and was among the first in a wave of communication services that used voice over internet protocol technology (VoIP), which converts audio into a digital signal.",
      "Skype's disappearance also inconveniences Americans and other expatriates living overseas who signed up because they needed an U.S.-based number to receive text authentication codes from, say, a bank back home. It was also handy for calling 800 numbers for free even if you weren't living in North America.",
      "Here is a guide for life after Skype:",
      "Microsoft announced in late February that it was shutting down Skype on May 5 and shifting some of its services to Microsoft Teams, its flagship office videoconferencing and group collaboration platform.",
      "Skype users can use their existing accounts to log into Teams and have the option to automatically migrate their contacts and chats.",
      "If you had a Skype number or a calling subscription, it stopped automatically renewing on April 3.",
      "If your account still has credit, you can access Skype's dial pad from the web portal or Teams to make calls.",
      "Skype numbers won't immediately expire on May 5 so you'll still be able to receive calls until your subscription expires. But you'll have to use Teams or keep the Skype dial pad open on the web portal to receive them.",
      "If your Skype number hasn't expired and you don't want to lose it, you should transfer it to another provider.",
      "Skype numbers can be ported to a phone carrier or any number of other VoIP services. But you'll have to start the process through the new provider, not Skype.",
      "Google users can access the online search giant's internet phone service to make calls from a smartphone or a desktop web browser. You can get your own Google Voice phone number and use features like call forwarding and voicemail. Or you can port your number from another service like Skype, but it will cost $20.",
      "Calls to U.S., Canadian or Puerto Rican numbers are free. Rates for other countries vary.",
      "The free version of Google Voice is only available to U.S. residents physically located in the 48 contiguous states, so that means expatriate Americans can only use it if they registered before they moved overseas.",
      "\u201cYou cannot sign up for a Google Voice number while outside the USA,\u201d according to a help page. \u201cDo not try to circumvent this by using a VPN.\u201d",
      "Owned by Japan's Rakuten, Viber was long considered one of the closest competitors to Skype. One key difference is that Skype users don't need a phone number and are identified by their usernames, while Viber users need a number to register for service.",
      "Similar to Skype, Viber users can buy credit or packages to call phone numbers around the world but it's no longer possible to get a Viber number to receive calls.",
      "The videoconferencing service that\u2019s become a byword for online company meetings offers a calling service, Zoom Phone, and features like number porting and the ability to send and receive SMS text messages.",
      "Take note that Zoom Phone isn't free. There are various calling plans that involve a monthly subscription cost and extra fees for international calls.",
      "Microsoft users have the option of making calls on Teams, dubbed Teams Phone. Like Zoom Phone, you'll need to buy a subscription and pay extra for international calls.",
      "But it's not an option for regular people because Microsoft says Teams Phone isn't for consumer use and is only available to small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "If you absolutely need a U.S. number but live overseas, sign up for service with a low-cost virtual wireless carrier that offers cheap cellphone plans or pay-as-you-go rates.",
      "One provider, Tello, offers monthly plans for as little as $5 and says users can activate its service even if they're living outside the U.S.",
      "Because mobile virtual network operators like Tello are essentially wireless phone companies that piggyback off a bigger carrier's physical network, you can't use it to make calls on a computer or an app.",
      "There are a slew of Skype pretenders offering phone calls over the internet, such as Zoiper, VoIP.ms, CallCentric, Mytello, and Virtual Landline. Many are aimed at business users.",
      "Some are capitalizing on Skype\u2019s disappearance. Hushed, which started as an anonymous calling app, bills itself as a Skype alternative. Users can buy a phone number from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom or Puerto Rico or port their own number.",
      "It warns that some of its numbers aren't guaranteed to work with third-party verification text messages.",
      "\u201cWe do not intentionally block anyone from receiving these codes, but it\u2019s common that some services will prevent verification texts from being sent to certain phone numbers due to their own security policies,\" Hushed says on its website.",
      "Maybe you can't decide which calling service you want to switch to. If you want to save your current number, there are services to just park your number like NumberBarn.com and Parkmyphone.com.",
      "They let you store a phone number for a monthly fee while relaying any text messages sent to that number. You can port the number to another service whenever you want.",
      "Beware, you can only port in U.S. or Canadian phone numbers.",
      "What about an international eSIM? They're the virtual version of the mobile phone SIM card that you can buy and add to your phone when you're on a trip to save on roaming fees.",
      "They offer cheap data access rates so you can use the internet without worrying about racking up a huge bill when you get home.",
      "Unfortunately, you can't port a Skype number to an international eSIM because of \u201cthe fundamental differences\" between VoIP services and traditional mobile networks, said Pedro Maiquez, co-founder of eSIM provider Holafly. \u201cSkype numbers are not tied to a mobile carrier\u2019s physical infrastructure, making them incompatible with mobile eSIM solutions.\"",

      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company\u2019s digital ad network",
      "The U.S. Justice Department is doubling down on its attempt to break up Google by asking it to give up the underlying technology powering the company's digital ad network. The proposed remedy joins a separate federal effort to separate the Chrome browser from its dominant search engine.",
      "The government's latest proposal was filed late Monday in a Virginia federal court two-and-half weeks after a federal judge ruled that parts of its lucrative digital ad network have been improperly abusing its market power to stifle competition to the detriment of online publishers.",
      "In a 17-page filing, Justice Department lawyers argued that U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema should punish Google by ordering the company to offload its AdX business and DFP ad platform, tools that bring together advertisers, who want to market their products, and publishers, who want to sell commercial space on their sites, to bring in revenue.",
      "Not surprisingly, it's an idea that Google vehemently plans to oppose when the penalty phase of the antitrust case \u2014known as remedy hearings \u2014 begins in late September. Google already has vowed to appeal Brinkema's ruling that the technology powering the ad network has been breaking the law, but can't do that until the judge rules on its punishment in a decision expected late this year or early next year.",
      "Google said in its own filing Monday that divestiture of AdX and DFP wouldn\u2019t be technically feasible because neither piece of technology is capable of working outside of Google's proprietary infrastructure. The company proposed its own remedies to restore competition, and reiterated its intent to appeal the ruling.",
      "\u201cDivestiture is not as simple as selling either the AdX or DFP source code to a willing buyer,\u201d Google wrote.",
      "The attempt to tear down Google's ad network comes on top of the Justice Department's ongoing effort to have the company part with its popular Chrome browser and impose other restrictions to curtail the power of its ubiquitous search engine, which another federal judge branded an illegal monopoly in a ruling last August.",
      "The remedy hearings in the search case are scheduled to conclude later this month, with a ruling from U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta expected by Labor Day.",
      "If the Justice Department is able to persuade the two different judges to order its proposed dismantling of Google, it would be the biggest breakup of a U.S. company since AT&T was forced to spin off its phone service into seven separate regional companies more than 40 years ago.",
      "Google's Play Store for apps running on its Android software that powers most of the world's smartphones also was declared an illegal monopoly by a federal jury in 2023 and is battling a judge's order that would require it to overhaul a commission system that generates billions of dollars in annual revenue.",
      "But hobbling its search engine and digital ad network would be far bigger blows because they are the key cogs in a business that generated $265 billion in revenue last year.",
      "Google is confronting the breakup threats at the same time the advent of artificial intelligence is changing the way consumers are using technology and seeking information online \u2014 a shift that could also siphon traffic and money away from a powerhouse that began in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Despite the adversity, Google is still delivering robust financial growth to its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., which is currently valued at $2 trillion.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- In a country celebrated for its ancient wisdom, Greece is offering a modern solution to a pressing household challenge: empowering parents to oversee their children\u2019s online activity.",
      "On Monday, the government launched a state-operated mobile app, marking one of Europe\u2019s most assertive steps toward digital age verification.",
      "Kids Wallet, now available on iOS and Android, gives parents tools to verify their children\u2019s ages on digital platforms and monitor their browsing activity, officials said.",
      "\u201cThis is an application that Greece \u2014 and Europe \u2014 needs to confirm children\u2019s ages when they use social media,\u201d said Digital Governance Minister Dimitris Papastergiou. \u201cIt will also serve as an identification tool for upcoming initiatives.\u201d",
      "Unlike stricter approaches adopted in some European countries, Greece has made the app\u2019s use voluntary, though officials argue it offers more powerful controls. The initiative aligns with broader EU-wide efforts to standardize age verification across member states.",

    "summary": "Judges in several states may soon get a new tool to stop dangerous drivers from speeding again",
    "story": [
      "Judges in several states may soon get a new tool to stop dangerous drivers from speeding again",
      "A teenager who admitted being \u201caddicted to speed\u201d behind the wheel had totaled two other cars in the year before he slammed into a minivan at 112 mph (180 kph) in a Seattle suburb, killing the driver and three of the five children she was transporting for a homeschool co-op.",
      "After sentencing Chase Daniel Jones last month to more than 17 years in prison, the judge tacked on a novel condition should he drive again: His vehicle must be equipped with a device that prevents accelerating far beyond the speed limit.",
      "Virginia this year became the first state to give its judges such a tool to deal with the most dangerous drivers on the road. Washington, D.C., already is using it and similar measures await governors' signatures in Washington state and Georgia. New York and California also could soon tap the GPS-based technology to help combat a recent national spike in traffic deaths.",
      "\u201cIt's a horror no one should have to experience,\u201d said Amy Cohen, who founded the victims' advocacy group Families for Safe Streets after her 12-year-old son, Sammy Cohen Eckstein, was killed by a speeding driver in front of their New York home more than a decade ago.",
      "Andrea Hudson, 38, the minivan driver who was killed when Jones ran a red light, was building a backyard greenhouse with her husband to help educate several kids who shuttle between homes during the school day, her father, Ted Smith, said.",
      "Also killed in the March 2024 crash near Hudson's home in Renton, Washington, were Boyd \u201cBuster\u201d Brown and Eloise Wilcoxson, both 12, and Matilda Wilcoxson, 13. Hudson's two children were sitting on the passenger side and survived, but they spent weeks in a hospital.",
      "\u201cYou always hear of these horrific accidents, and it\u2019s always far away, you don\u2019t know anybody. But all of a sudden, that\u2019s my daughter,\" Smith said. \u201cThis guy did not swerve or brake. And it was just a missile.\u201d",
      "Smith knew Washington state Rep. Mari Leavitt, who reached out to offer condolences and tell him she was sponsoring legislation to mandate intelligent speed assistance devices as a condition for habitual speeders to get back their suspended licenses.",
      "Leavitt predicts it will have an even more powerful impact than revoking driving privileges, citing studies showing around three-quarters of people who lose their licenses get behind a wheel anyway.",
      "Between 2019 and 2024, the state saw a 200% increase in drivers cited for going at least 50 mph (80 kph) over the speed limit, according to the Washington Traffic Safety Commission.",
      "\u201cI guess I don\u2019t understand why someone is compelled to want to drive that fast,\u201d Leavitt said. \u201cBut if they choose to drive that fast with the speed limiter, they can\u2019t. It's going to stop them in their tracks.\u201d",
      "The measure, which Washington legislators passed last month and Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson is expected to soon sign, is called the BEAM Act, using the first letters of the names of the four victims: Buster, Eloise, Andrea and Matilda.",
      "Because Jones, 19, didn't receive a speeding ticket in his two previous crashes, he likely wouldn't have been required to use the speed-limiter ahead of the fatal one. And because it could be 2029 before the law takes effect, the judge's requirement at sentencing only applies to his time on probation after being released from prison, Smith said.",
      "Competing tech companies that joined forces to lobby for ignition interlock requirements for drunken drivers have been working in unison again the last few years to pitch intelligent speed assistance.",
      "Brandy Nannini, chief government affairs officer at one manufacturer, Grapevine, Texas-based Smart Start, said fleet vehicles including school buses in the nation's capital have been trying it out for years.",
      "But it took a lot of refinement before the GPS technology could instantly recognize speed limit changes and compel vehicles with the devices installed to adjust accordingly.",
      "\u201cWe've got a lot more satellites in the sky now,\u201d said Ken Denton, a retired police officer who is the chief compliance officer at Cincinnati-based LifeSafer, part of the coalition of companies.",
      "When court-mandated, the devices would prevent cars from exceeding speed limits or whatever threshold regulators set. An override button allows speeding in emergencies, but states can decide whether to activate it and authorities would be alerted any time the button is pushed.",
      "A more passive version, which beeps to alert drivers when they are going too fast, is required for new cars in the European Union. California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a similar proposal last year, explaining vehicle safety requirements are set by the federal government and he was concerned a patchwork of state laws could stir confusion.",
      "Before Del. Patrick Hope agreed to sponsor the proposal in the Virginia Legislature, he tried out the device in Nannini's car, which was calibrated to not go more than 9 mph (14 kph) over the speed limit.",
      "\u201cThat was my first question: Is it safe?\u201d Hope said.",
      "Not only did he come away convinced it was safe, Hope is now pondering whether to install it on the cars of his three children, all of whom are new drivers.",
      "For those mandated by a court, the price could be hefty: $4 per day and a $100 installation fee. The fee would be reduced for low-income offenders.",
      "Cohen with Families for Safe Streets, which provides support services to the loved ones of crash victims, knows firsthand the kind of impact slowing down speeders can make. A year after her son was struck and killed in front of their New York apartment, another boy was injured in the same spot.",
      "By then, the road's speed limit had been lowered.",
      "\u201cThat boy lived when he was hit, and mine did not,\u201d she said. \"When you are going a few miles slower, there's more time to stop. And when you hit somebody, it's much less likely to be deadly.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The move comes a day before U.S.-China trade negotiations are set to begin.",
      "President Donald Trump on Friday voiced a willingness to ease tariffs on China, saying on social media it \"seems right\" to slash levies from 145% to 80%.",
      "The announcement arrives a day before Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is set to begin trade negotiations with Chinese officials at a meeting in Geneva, Switzerland.",
      "The potential tariff reduction floated by Trump may avert a virtual standstill of trade between the world's two largest economies, but the move would not substantially ease expected price increases for goods such as clothes, sneakers and toys, analysts told ABC News.",
      "Product shortages would also remain a possibility at the lower tariff rate, they added.",
      "\"A tariff of 80% would still have a dramatic effect,\" Christian vom Lehn, an economics professor at Brigham Young University, told ABC News. \"It would mean a significant impact for consumers.\"",
      "Trump last month sharply increased tariffs on China, prompting China to retaliate with 125% tariffs on U.S. goods. The tit-for-tat measures set off a trade war with the third-largest U.S. trade partner, which accounted for nearly $440 billion worth of imports last year.",
      "The tariffs elicited warnings from a slew of companies about the risk of price increases for U.S shoppers.",
      "Toy giant Mattel warned in an earnings report this week of plans to shift some of its supply chain outside China, adding that when necessary it would take \"pricing action in its U.S. business.\" The move follows similar messages from electronics chain Best Buy as well as Chinese e-commerce retailers Shein and Temu.",
      "Chinese shipments to the U.S. have dropped significantly, falling 21% in April compared to a year earlier, data from China's General Administration of Customs on Friday showed.",
      "Risks for consumers would continue to linger for two key reasons, analysts said: An 80% tariff would still amount to a punishing tax on imports, while uncertainty about the chance of another policy shift would make it difficult for companies to take full advantage of the lower rate.",
      "Tariffs raise prices for consumers if importers fail to swallow the tax burden by eating into their profits or requesting a supplier sell the product at a lower rate in order to offset a share of the cost.",
      "Under the current 145% tariff on Chinese goods, suppliers and importers face immense pressure as they try to bear some of the tax cost out of concern that higher prices would hurt sales, experts told ABC News. Due to the sky-high tariff, however, many sellers have little choice but to hike prices or risk losses, they added.",
      "Those dynamics would remain in place at an 80% tariff rate, since it would still far exceed many companies' capacity to offset the added cost with lower profits, \u200b\u200bJason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University.",
      "\"An 80% tariff really doesn't change things too much,\" Miller said.",
      "Trump's announcement of a potential reduction of the tariff on China came two days after Trump ruled out any such lowering of the tariff level before negotiations.",
      "The developments followed a weeks-long back and forth during which the two sides disputed whether they had already started discussing the tariffs.",
      "The general sense of uncertainty would remain even after U.S. tariffs were to reach 80%, making it difficult for businesses to adapt their supply chains in a manner that would substantially ease costs and, in turn, offer relief for consumers, some analysts said.",
      "\"Even at a lower tariff, companies would have to be wondering whether this might go up again or or possibly come down again,\" David Andolfatto, an economist at the University of Miami, told ABC News.",
      "If companies could trust the possible 80% tariff level as a long-term policy stance, they may choose to reroute supply chains outside China or even initiate plans for some domestic production, Andolfatto said.",
      "But each trade policy announcement put forward by Trump appears subject to change, Andolfatto said, noting several modifications already undertaken by Trump.",
      "\"If anything changes, the Trump administration can unilaterally react and come back to the negotiating table,\" Andolfatto added.",
      "For his part, Bessent has referred to the White House approach as a negotiating tactic, describing the policy changes as \"strategic uncertainty.\"",
      "Testifying before a House subcommittee this week, Bessent said the Trump administration had commenced negotiations with 17 of the top 18 U.S. trade partners, excluding China. Those countries account for the vast majority of U.S. foreign trade, Bessent said.",
      "Trump unveiled the framework for a trade agreement with the United Kingdom on Thursday, marking the first such accord with any nation since the White House suspended some of its far-reaching \"Liberation Day\" tariffs last month.",
      "\"Every country wants to be making deals,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Thursday, noting the upcoming talks between Bessent and Chinese officials.",

    "summary": "Bipartisan pair of senators applaud DOJ investigation into egg producers over rising prices and want the department to look even further into the issue.",
    "story": [
      "Sens. Banks and Warren are asking the department to look deeper into the issue.",
      "A bipartisan pair of senators applauded the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into major egg producers over rising prices and called on the department to look even further into the issue in a letter to Assistant Attorney General Gail Slater late Thursday evening.",
      "\"We write to express support for the Department of Justice's reported investigation into anticompetitive practices in the U.S. egg industry,\" Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Republican Sen. Jim Banks wrote. \"As you are aware, the sustained increase in egg prices has placed a significant financial strain on American families, particularly workingclass households. While egg producers and trade associations point to recent avian flu outbreaks as the cause of high prices, we are concerned that record high egg prices reflect noncompetitive behavior among large producers.\"",
      "ABC News reported in March that the Department of Justice was in the early stages of investigating major egg producers over soaring egg prices. Sources told ABC News at the time that department investigators were looking into whether the major egg companies were sharing information about supply and pricing, possibly contributing to price increases.",
      "The average retail price of a dozen eggs climbed from $4.95 in January to $6.22 in March, the most recent month for which data is available, per Bureau of Labor Statistics data. That amounts to a 25% increase in consumer cost.",
      "By contrast, wholesale prices of eggs are falling. The average price of a dozen large white eggs was $3.69 over the week ending May 3, the most recent week available, according to Department of Agriculture data. Over the week ending Jan. 17 -- the last week of data before Trump took office -- the average price of a dozen large white eggs stood at $6.14, data showed. That's a nearly 40% decline.",
      "Egg producers, including the industry's trade association, have said that the hike in consumer egg costs is due to the avian flu. But in their letter, the senators cast doubt on this claim and encourage the Department of Justice to continue its efforts to determine whether \"noncompetitive behavior among large producers\" could be to blame.",
      "\"Egg prices began to drop from their record peaks only after the Department of Justice (DOJ) launched an investigation into whether large egg producers had engaged in anticompetitive practices to raise egg prices or restrict egg supply,\" Banks and Warren write. \"Large egg producers and trade associations have previously been found liable for price fixing. Given this history, we urge DOJ to thoroughly review whether recent trends in egg prices reflect impermissible coordination among egg producers and trade associations.\"",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Warren said Americans deserve answers over the cause of rising cost of eggs at the grocery store.",
      "\"While rising egg prices are hurting working families, giant egg producers are raking in record profits. Americans deserve to know if those sky-high prices are the result of out-of-control corporate greed. We're pressing the Justice Department to get answers,\" Warren said.",
      "Banks said the egg industry is \"long overdue\" for an antitrust investigation.",
      "\"America\u2019s egg industry has been controlled by a handful of companies for years, and it\u2019s long overdue for an antitrust investigation to bring down prices and create more competition,\" Banks said. \"I fully support the Department of Justice\u2019s probe into whether these companies have exploited the avian flu outbreak to manipulate prices.\u201d",
      "The ballooning cost of eggs was an ongoing political flashpoint during the 2024 presidential race. Then-candidate Donald Trump made lowering the cost of groceries a cornerstone of his campaign. Since returning to the Oval Office, he's often spoken about egg prices and in recent days, he's touted repeatedly that egg prices are lower because of his leadership.",
      "\"Gas is down, gasoline is down, energy is down, groceries are down, eggs are down. Eggs, thank you very much. But eggs are down,\" Trump said during remarks in the Oval office on Thursday.",
      "Warren and Banks say the cost of eggs continues to be a burden on American families.",

      "The move to expel migrants would curtail a constitutional right to due process.",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Friday that the Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" suspending habeas corpus, the right of a person to challenge their detention in court.",
      "If carried out by President Donald Trump, the suspension of habeas corpus would be a dramatic escalation of his administration's immigration policy by significantly curtailing a right enshrined in the Constitution.",
      "\"First, you know, President Trump has talked about potentially suspending habeas corpus to take care of the illegal immigration problem. When could we see that happen in the future?\" a reporter asked Miller as he spoke outside the White House.",
      "\"The Constitution is clear, and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land, that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in time of invasion,\" Miller answered.",
      "\"So, it's an option we're actively looking at,\" he continued.",
      "The Constitution allows for the suspension of habeas corpus in extraordinary circumstances, Article I saying writs of habeas corpus \"shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"",
      "According to the National Constitution Center, the United States has suspended habeas corpus four times in the past -- during the Civil War, during Reconstruction in South Carolina, in the Philippines during a 1905 insurrection, and in Hawaii in 1941 after Pearl Harbor was bombed by Japan during World War II.",
      "Miller justified the potential suspension of habeas corpus by arguing the United States is currently facing a national security threat by undocumented migrants \"invading\" the United States.",
      "A similar rationale was used by Trump in March to invoke the Alien Enemies Act -- a law that would allow the speedy deportation of noncitizens with little to no due process -- to remove alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "But two separate federal judges, including one appointed by Trump, said the use of the Alien Enemies act was unlawful because the Trump administration did not prove United States is being invaded by Tren de Aragua.",
      "Miller said that the administration's decision would come down to whether the \"courts do the right thing or not.\"",
      "But legal experts say the issue is not as cut and dried as Miller suggests, and that a president cannot suspend habeas corpus without authorization from Congress.",
      "\"Miller also doesn't deign to mention that the near-universal consensus is that only Congress can suspend habeas corpus -- and that unilateral suspensions by the President are per se unconstitutional,\" Georgetown University Law Center professor Steve Vladeck writes in his Substack blog.",
      "\"He's suggesting that the administration would (unlawfully) suspend habeas corpus if (but apparently only if) it disagrees with how courts rule in these cases. In other words, it's not the judicial review itself that's imperiling national security; it's the possibility that the government might lose. That's not, and has never been, a viable argument for suspending habeas corpus,\" he writes.",
      "President Abraham Lincoln famously suspended the writ of habeas corpus at the outbreak of the Civil War.",
      "But then-Chief Justice Roger Taney deemed the move unlawful, noting the operative clause is found in Article I of the Constitution, which itemizes Congress' powers, not the president's.",
      "Lincoln ultimately sought congressional approval for the suspension as the war dragged on.",

NO, Ross Perot cost him the Election! In any event, Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm OK if they do!!!\" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform.",

      "\"The president himself has said he wouldn't mind paying a little bit more to help the poor and the middle class and the working class in this country,\" Leavitt said. \"These negotiations are ongoing on Capitol Hill and the president will weigh in when he feels necessary.\"",
      "The ambiguous presidential declaration has thrown negotiators into a frantic scramble -- with the House Ways and Means committee expected to mark up their legislation next week.",
      "The inclusion of a tax hike in the \"big, beautiful bill\" would be a major reversal for House GOP leaders, who have argued that allowing the current tax rates to expire would amount to a tax increase.",
      "\"I'm not in favor of raising the tax rates because that's -- our party is the group that stands against that, traditionally,\" Speaker Mike Johnson said in an interview on Fox News in late April.",
      "During his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in 1992, incumbent President George H.W. Bush uttered the infamous line, \"read my lips: no new taxes.\" Voters ultimately rejected Bush at the ballot box after he broke his vow and signed legislation crafted by congressional Democrats that increased tax revenues to address the growing budget deficit.",

      "Former President Joe Biden has reemerged into the public eye with two back-to-back sit-down interviews, sharing his diagnosis of the Democrats' stinging election losses, defending his mental acuity, which was fiercely questioned at the end of his term, and all the while defining his version of his more than three-decades-long political legacy.",
      "And while some Democrats say there is \"a place for Joe Biden at the table,\" others say it's better for him to be out of the spotlight and that relitigating his campaign is stagnating the party.",
      "Speaking to ABC's \"The View\" on Thursday, Biden took responsibility for President Donald Trump's historic return to the White House and pushed back on claims of cognitive decline in his final year in office. He also addressed his next steps, saying he was \"getting squared away trying to figure out what the most significant and consequential role I can play, consistent with what I've done in the past.\"",
      "Part of that reflection will come in the form of a book that he said he is beginning to write now. But some Democrats are torn as to whether the book and a few media appearances are where they'd like his contributions to end.",

I will always be grateful to President Biden for his commitment to saving America in one of our darkest times,\" said Harrison.",

      "Other blocs of the party are far more critical, with some Democrats telling ABC News that they find the former president's foray defensive and a misguided distraction.",
      "One Democratic strategist said they believe Biden is mishandling his role and stagnating the party.",
      "As long as the conversations revolve around Biden, the strategist, who has experience in Congress and presidential campaigns, said, \"we cannot move forward as a country or a party.\"",
      "\"He's not really telling his own story. He's just fighting with everyone else about their telling of his story,\" the strategist said.",
      "This strategist said they believe that Biden should follow in the less vocal post-White House footsteps of former presidents such as Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. This person said Biden should focus his attention on his eventual presidential library and foundation.",
      "\"These first 100 days, these first six months, like this first calendar year, it's all going to be political questions. You don't have to answer those anymore. You actually shouldn't be answering those anymore,\" the strategist said of Biden. \"Democrats talk a lot about how Donald Trump has ruined norms. Joe Biden is kind of ruining a lot of norms with how to be an ex-president right now.\"",
      "Senior Democratic strategist Sawyer Hackett told ABC News that while Biden is entitled to defend his legacy, relitigating campaign losses, or in his estimation, \"rewriting political history,\" is wholly unhelpful and stressed the party is in desperate need to move forward.",
      "\"The Democratic Party is working to claw itself out of the political wilderness we were left in under the stewardship of Joe Biden. It's utterly delusional and extremely unhelpful for Biden to wax poetic about how he could have beaten Trump, given the dire straits he left our coalition in,\" said Hackett.",
      "To Hackett, Biden will best serve fellow Democrats from the wings.",

The department said that as a bus carrying detainees was entering in the afternoon \u201ca group of protestors, including two members of the U.S. House of Representatives, stormed the gate and broke into the detention facility.\u201d",
      "Watson Coleman spokesperson Ned Cooper said the three lawmakers went there unannounced because they planned to inspect it, not take a scheduled tour.",
      "\u201cThey arrived, explained to the guards and the officials at the facility that they were there to exercise their oversight authority,\u201d he said, adding that they were allowed to enter and inspect the center sometime between 3 and 4 p.m.",
      "Watson Coleman later said the DHS statement inaccurately characterized the visit.",
      "\u201cContrary to a press statement put out by DHS we did not \u2018storm\u2019 the detention center,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe author of that press release was so unfamiliar with the facts on the ground that they didn\u2019t even correctly count the number of Representatives present. We were exercising our legal oversight function as we have done at the Elizabeth Detention Center without incident.\u201d",
      "In video of the altercation shared with The Associated Press, a federal official in a jacket with the logo of the Homeland Security Investigations can be heard telling Baraka he could not enter the facility because \u201cyou are not a congress member.\u201d",
      "Baraka then left the secure area, rejoining protesters on the public side of the gate. Video showed him speaking through the gate to a man in a suit, who said: \u201cThey\u2019re talking about coming back to arrest you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not on their property. They can\u2019t come out on the street and arrest me,\u201d Baraka replied.",
      "Minutes later several ICE agents, some wearing face coverings, surrounded him and others on the public side. As protesters cried out, \u201cShame,\u201d Baraka was dragged back through the gate in handcuffs.",
      "Several civil rights and immigration reform advocates, as well as government officials, condemned Baraka\u2019s arrest. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin, whose office is defending a state law barring private immigration detention facilities, criticized the arrest during a seemingly peaceful protest and said no state or local law enforcement agencies were involved.",
      "Rep. Menendez said in a statement that as members of Congress, they have the legal right to carry out oversight at DHS facilities without prior notice and have done so twice already this year. But on Friday, \u201cThroughout every step of this visit, ICE attempted to intimidate everyone involved and impede our ability to conduct oversight.\u201d",
      "The two-story building next to a county prison formerly operated as a halfway house.",
      "In February, ICE awarded a 15-year contract to The Geo Group Inc. to run the detention center. Geo valued the contract at $1 billion, in an unusually long and large agreement for ICE.",
      "The announcement was part of President Donald Trump\u2019s plans to sharply increase detention beds nationwide from a budget of about 41,000 beds this year.",
      "Baraka sued Geo soon after the deal was announced.",
      "Geo touted the Delaney Hall contract during an earnings call with shareholders Wednesday, with CEO David Donahue saying it was expected to generate more than $60 million a year in revenue. He said the facility began the intake process May 1.",
      "Hall said the activation of the center and another in Michigan would increase capacity under contract with ICE from around 20,000 beds to around 23,000.",
      "DHS said in its statement that the facility has the proper permits and inspections have been cleared.",

      "GENEVA -- The U.S. Treasury Secretary and America\u2019s top trade negotiator began talks with high-ranking Chinese officials in Switzerland Saturday aiming to de-escalate a dispute that threatens to cut off trade between the world\u2019s two biggest economies and damage the global economy.",
      "The Xinhua News Agency says Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson have begun meetings in Geneva with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier He Lifeng.",
      "Diplomats from both sides also confirmed that the talks have begun but spoke anonymously and the exact location of the talks wasn't made public.",
      "Prospects for a major breakthrough appear dim. But there is hope that the two countries will scale back the massive taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 they\u2019ve slapped on each other\u2019s goods, a move that would relieve world financial markets and companies on both sides of the Pacific Ocean that depend on U.S.-China trade.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump last month raised U.S. tariffs on China to a combined 145%, and China retaliated by hitting American imports with a 125% levy. Tariffs that high essentially amount to the countries\u2019 boycotting each other\u2019s products, disrupting trade that last year topped $660 billion.",
      "Even before the talks began, Trump suggested Friday that the U.S. could lower its tariffs on China, saying in a Truth Social post that \u201c 80% Tariff seems right! Up to Scott.\u2033",
      "Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Stimson Center, noted it will be the first time He and Bessent have talked. And she doubts the Geneva meeting will produce any substantive results.",
      "\u201cThe best scenario is for the two sides to agree to de-escalate on the ... tariffs at the same time,\u201d she said, adding even a small reduction would send a positive signal. \u201cIt cannot just be words.\u201d",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has aggressively used tariffs as his favorite economic weapon. He has, for example, imposed a 10% tax on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "But the fight with China has been the most intense. His tariffs on China include a 20% charge meant to pressure Beijing into doing more to stop the flow of the synthetic opioid fentanyl into the United States. The remaining 125% involve a dispute that dates back to Trump\u2019s first term and comes atop tariffs he levied on China back then, which means the total tariffs on some Chinese goods can exceed the 145%.",
      "During Trump's first term, the U.S. alleged that China uses unfair tactics to give itself an edge in advanced technologies such as quantum computing and driverless cars. These include forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over trade secrets in exchange for access to the Chinese market; using government money to subsidize domestic tech firms; and outright theft of sensitive technologies.",
      "Those issues were never fully resolved. After nearly two years of negotiation, the United States and China reached a so-called Phase One agreement in January 2020. The U.S. agreed then not to go ahead with even higher tariffs on China, and Beijing agreed to buy more American products. The tough issues \u2013 such as China\u2019s subsidies \u2013 were left for future negotiations.",
      "But China didn\u2019t come through with the promised purchases, partly because COVID-19 disrupted global commerce just after the Phase One truce was announced.",
      "The fight over China's tech policy now resumes.",
      "Trump is also agitated by America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $263 billion last year.",
      "In Switzerland, Bessent and Greer also plan to meet with Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter.",
      "Trump last month suspended plans to slap hefty 31% tariffs on Swiss goods -- more than the 20% levies he plastered on exports from European Union. For now, he's reduced those taxes to 10% but could raise them again.",
      "The government in Bern is taking a cautious approach. But it has warned of the impact on crucial Swiss industries like watches, coffee capsules, cheese and chocolate.",
      "\u201cAn increase in trade tensions is not in Switzerland\u2019s interests. Countermeasures against U.S. tariff increases would entail costs for the Swiss economy, in particular by making imports from the USA more expensive,\u201d the government said last week, adding that the executive branch \u201cis therefore not planning to impose any countermeasures at the present time.\u201d",
      "The government said Swiss exports to the United States on Saturday were subject to an additional 10% tariff, and another 21% beginning Wednesday.",
      "The United States is Switzerland\u2019s second-biggest trading partner after the EU \u2013 a 27-member-country bloc that nearly surrounds the wealthy Alpine country of more than 9 million. U.S.-Swiss trade in goods and services has quadrupled over the last two decades, the government said.",
      "The Swiss government said Switzerland abolished all industrial tariffs on Jan. 1 last year, meaning that 99% of all goods from the United States can be imported into Switzerland duty-free.",

      "A man who was found dead along Interstate 5 in Oregon has been identified after nearly 45 years and police say a notorious California serial killer is the sole person of interest in the case.",
      "The 30-year-old was identified Friday as Larry Eugene Parks. Oregon State Police spokesperson Kyle Kennedy said Randy Kraft, who has been dubbed the \u201cScorecard Killer,\u201d is the only person under investigation for the 1980 killing.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some evidence that we\u2019re processing to determine that link,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cWe are very confident that we have the correct person of interest.\u201d",
      "Kraft, now 80, was convicted in 1989 of brutalizing and killing 16 men over a decade in California and sentenced to death. He remains incarcerated at San Quentin State Prison and has denied killing anyone.",
      "On July 18, 1980, police responded to a report of a body now identified as Parks along I-5 south of Portland near Woodburn. Police opened a homicide investigation at the time and unsuccessfully tried to identify the victim.",
      "Parks, a Vietnam veteran whose family had lost contact with him in 1979, had last been seen in Pensacola, Florida, police said.",
      "Kraft was pulled over in his vehicle on a California freeway in 1983 after a trooper spotted him driving erratically. In the passenger seat of the vehicle was a strangled U.S. Marine. In the trunk of Kraft\u2019s vehicle was a coded list believed to tally 67 victims in California, Oregon and Michigan, according to police.",
      "Prosecutors described Kraft, a former computer programmer, as a fetishist who kept some of the dismembered parts of his victims in his freezer.",
      "In 2024, an Orange County Sheriff\u2019s Department investigator reached out to the Oregon State Police Cold Case Unit and offered to help identify the remains using forensic investigative genetic genealogy. A genetic profile was developed from a blood sample and Parks' identity was confirmed after possible family members submitted DNA profiles for comparison, according to police.",
      "Until his identification last month, the circumstances of his disappearance were unknown to the his family, police said.",
      "In 2023, the remains of a teenager believed to have been killed by Kraft in California were also identified using investigative genetic genealogy.",

      "A California judge has ordered the Trump administration to halt much of its massive downsizing of the federal workforce",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- The Trump administration must halt much of its dramatic downsizing of the federal workforce, a California judge ordered Friday.",
      "Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco issued the emergency order in a lawsuit filed last week by labor unions and cities, one of multiple legal challenges to Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to shrink the size of a federal government he calls bloated and expensive.",
      "\u201cThe Court holds the President likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime,\u201d Illston wrote in her order.",
      "The temporary restraining order directs numerous federal agencies to halt acting on the president\u2019s workforce executive order signed in February and a subsequent memo issued by the Department of Government Efficiency and the Office of Personnel Management.",
      "The order, which expires in 14 days, does not require departments to rehire people. Plaintiffs asked that the effective date of any agency action be postponed and that departments stop implementing or enforcing the executive order, including taking any further action.",
      "They limited their request to departments where dismantlement is already underway or poised to be underway, including at the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which announced in March it will lay off 10,000 workers and centralize divisions.",
      "Illston, who was nominated to the bench by former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, said at a hearing Friday the president has authority to seek changes in the executive branch departments and agencies created by Congress.",
      "\u201cBut he must do so in lawful ways,\u201d she said. \u201cHe must do so with the cooperation of Congress, the Constitution is structured that way.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly said voters gave him a mandate to remake the federal government, and he tapped billionaire Elon Musk to lead the charge through DOGE.",
      "Tens of thousands of federal workers have been fired, left their jobs via deferred resignation programs or have been placed on leave as a result of Trump\u2019s government-shrinking efforts. There is no official figure for the job cuts, but at least 75,000 federal employees took deferred resignation, and thousands of probationary workers have already been let go.",
      "In her order, Illston gave several examples to show the impact of the downsizing. One union that represents federal workers who research health hazards faced by mineworkers said it was poised to lose 221 of 222 workers in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, office; a Vermont farmer didn\u2019t receive a timely inspection on his property to receive disaster aid after flooding and missed an important planting window; a reduction in Social Security Administration workers has led to longer wait times for recipients.",
      "All the agencies impacted were created by Congress, she noted.",
      "Lawyers for the government argued Friday that the executive order and memo calling for large-scale personnel reductions and reorganization plans provided only general principles that agencies should follow in exercising their own decision-making process.",
      "\u201cIt expressly invites comments and proposals for legislative engagement as part of policies that those agencies wish to implement,\u201d Eric Hamilton, a deputy assistant attorney general, said of the memo. \u201cIt is setting out guidance.\u201d",
      "But Danielle Leonard, an attorney for plaintiffs, said it was clear that the president, DOGE and OPM were making decisions outside of their authority and not inviting dialogue from agencies.",
      "\u201cThey are not waiting for these planning documents\" to go through long processes, she said. \u201cThey\u2019re not asking for approval, and they\u2019re not waiting for it.\u201d",
      "The temporary restraining order applies to departments including the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Labor, Interior, State, Treasury and Veterans Affairs.",
      "It also applies to the National Science Foundation, Small Business Association, Social Security Administration and Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "Some of the labor unions and nonprofit groups are also plaintiffs in another lawsuit before a San Francisco judge challenging the mass firings of probationary workers. In that case, Judge William Alsup ordered the government in March to reinstate those workers, but the U.S. Supreme Court later blocked his order.",
      "Plaintiffs include the cities of San Francisco, Chicago and Baltimore; labor group American Federation of Government Employees; and nonprofit groups Alliance for Retired Americans, Center for Taxpayer Rights and Coalition to Protect America\u2019s National Parks.",

      "TOPEKA, Kan. -- A man convicted of killing a Kansas Highway Patrol trooper in 1978 has been granted parole after having past requests rejected, inspiring criticism and prompting the governor on Friday to call for reconsidering the decision.",
      "Jimmie K. Nelms and another man, both from Tulsa, Oklahoma, were sentenced to serve two life sentences for the aggravated kidnapping and murder of Trooper Conroy O'Brien following a traffic stop on the Kansas Turnpike about 55 miles (89 kilometers) northeast of Wichita. Nelms' codefendant, Walter Myrick, died in prison in 2009.",
      "In Kansas, killing a law enforcement officer now can be punished by death, with the only other possible sentence in a capital case being life in prison without parole. But in 1978, Kansas had no death penalty, and Nelms was eligible for parole after 30 years in 2008. He sought parole in 2011 and 2021.",
      "A date for Nelms' release hasn't been set. His release was approved by the Prisoner Review Board, comprised of three veteran state Department of Corrections employees appointed by its top administrator. Department spokesman David Thompson said the decision came several weeks after a March 6 hearing.",
      "\u201cThe Kansas Prisoner Review Board believes that Mr. Nelms is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen and is of the opinion that there is reasonable probability that Mr. Nelms can be released without detriment to the community or to himself,\u201d Thompson said in a statement.",
      "The decision didn't become public until the Kansas State Troopers Association condemned it as \u201cdisgraceful and disgusting\u201d in a statement Thursday. Under Kansas law, it appears unlikely that critics can prevent Nelms' release.",
      "\u201cThose who murder law enforcement officers should expect to receive the death penalty, not to be walking free on the streets of KS,\u201d state Attorney General Kris Kobach said in a post on the social platform X.",
      "The Kansas Legislature's top leaders, Senate President Ty Masterson and House Speaker Dan Hawkins, called the parole decision \u201cunconscionable\u201d Friday.",
      "They and Kobach are Republicans; the Department of Corrections is under Gov. Laura Kelly, a Democrat. But Kelly wants the board to consider reversing the decision \u201cif legally possible,\" spokesperson Grace Hoge said.",
      "\u201cThe facts of this case demonstrate a brutal and intentional killing of a law enforcement officer,\u201d Hoge said in an email. \u201cThere is no justification for this decision.\u201d",
      "According to court records and news reports, O'Brien stopped Nelms' car for speeding about 2 miles south of a turnpike service area. Myrick was driving.",
      "As O'Brien wrote a ticket in his patrol car, Nelms approached the driver's side with a gun, according to authorities. Nelms forced O'Brien to get out of the car and told him to lie down in a ditch. Authorities said Nelms took O'Brien's gun, struck the trooper with it, and, when O'Brien fell to the ground, shot him twice in the head.",
      "O'Brien was 26 with a pregnant wife. Nelms was 31 and Myrick, 25. A 21-year-old man was also in the car with Nelms and Myrick, but he pleaded guilty to lesser charges and provided crucial testimony against Nelms.",
      "The men fled in Nelms' car, left the turnpike, and eventually drove north, where another patrol trooper spotted the car about 20 miles (32 kilometers) northwest of where O'Brien died. Nelms' car and the trooper's collided in a pasture, and a gun battle ensued.",
      "Nelms denied he was the shooter, but jurors convicted him and Myrick of murder, aggravated kidnapping and other charges during a joint trial.",
      "Nelms served most of his sentence in maximum-security prisons but was transferred to a lower-security facility in 2023. Online Department of Corrections records show four disciplinary reports against him from 1996 to 2017, the last for disobeying orders. Thompson said Nelms works in the prison laundry.",
      "When Nelms sought parole in 2011, decisions were made by a three-member parole board appointed by the governor, subject to state Senate confirmation. That same year, Republican Gov. Sam Brownback issued an executive order abolishing the parole board in favor of a panel of Department of Corrections employees.",
      "Brownback said the move would save the state $500,000 a year, and sentencing laws after 1993 limited parole. Critics worried that the department's board would release inmates just to avoid prison overcrowding, and Kelly, then a state senator, called the change \u201ca really bad idea.\u201d",
      "Masterson, the current Senate president, backed the change in 2011 but said Friday that it \u201chas not functioned as intended\" and that he would work for changes to see that the review board members \u201crightly answer to the people of Kansas.\u201d",
      "Democratic state Rep. Tom Sawyer, who reviewed Nelms' case as a parole board member from 2009 through June 2011, said the board sometimes rejected parole when corrections officials recommended. Now, he said, the process is \u201call in-house.\u201d",
      "As for Nelms, Sawyer said, \u201cI think it\u2019s highly unlikely the parole board would have let him go, based on my experience.\u201d",

      "Toy dolls have become the latest rhetorical poster child for President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump's tariffs crusade has taken aim at a number of foreign goods, from European wines and car parts from Mexico to films made abroad. Lately, the president's wandering ire has found another rhetorical poster child: toy dolls.",
      "Trump asserted that children will be fine having two dolls \u2014 perhaps three or five \u2014 instead of 30 if U.S. import taxes increase consumer prices. The response on social media included memes of him portrayed as the Grinch and photos of a young Barron Trump\u2019s child-sized Mercedes convertible.",
      "\u201cCOMPLETELY out of touch,\" The Loyal Subjects CEO Jonathan Cathey, whose collectible toy company in Los Angeles produces Strawberry Shortcake and Rainbow Brite dolls, wrote on Linkedin. \"If that ain\u2019t a \u2018Let them eat cake\u2019 moment shot through the echoes of history? Love how toys and dolls have become THE martyr metaphor for this nonsensical trade war incoherence.\u201d",
      "The president's comments also touched a nerve with parents, both ones who took offense at the casual way he hypothesized that perhaps \u201ctwo dolls will cost a couple bucks more\u201d and those who acknowledged their own kids have more toys than they need.",
      "Either way, the U.S. toy industry has a lot riding on a possible deescalation of the tariff standoff between the Trump administration and the government in Beijing. Nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. come from China.",
      "The Toy Association, a trade group, has lobbied for an immediate reprieve from the 145% tariff rate the president put on Chinese-made products. Some toy companies warn the likelihood of holiday shortages increases each week the tariff remains in effect.",
      "Here's a snapshot of the doll debate and how tariffs are impacting toys:",
      "From Barbie, Bratz and Cabbage Patch Kids to Adora baby dolls, American Girl and Our Generation, dolls are a big business in the U.S. as well as beloved playthings.",
      "The doll category, which includes accessories like clothes, generated U.S. sales of $2.7 billion last year compared to $2.9 billion in 2023 and $3.4 billion in 2019, according to market research firm Circana.",
      "Consumers splurged on toys during the height of the COVID pandemic to keep children and themselves occupied, but sales flattened as inflation seized the economy.",
      "Younger girls becoming more interested in buying makeup and skincare also has cooled the demand for dolls, Marshal Cohen, Circana's chief retail advisor, said.",
      "The nation's largest toy maker, Mattel, said this week it would have to raise prices for some products sold in the U.S. to offset higher costs related to tariffs.",
      "The company, whose brands include Barbie and American Girl, said the increases were necessary even though it\u2019s speeding up the expansion of its manufacturing base outside of China.",
      "Smaller toy companies are expected to have a harder time than Mattel and Hasbro, which makes the eating, drinking and diaper-wetting Baby Alive. Cathey said he paused The Loyal Subjects' shipments from China in April because he couldn't pay the stratospheric tariff they would have incurred.",
      "\u201cNobody insulates themselves with that much cash,\u201d he said.",
      "With about four months' worth of inventory on hand, Cathey said his ability to secure holiday stock depends on a break in the U.S.-China trade standoff happening in the next two weeks since it would take time for cargo operations to resume.",
      "Cepia, a Missouri company that was behind the 2009 holiday season hit Zhu Zhu Pets, launched a line of 11-inch fashion dolls called Decora Girlz last year. CEO James Russell Hornsby said he was working to relocate some production but the move won't happen in time to replace the orders he planned to get from China.",
      "Hornsby described himself as a Trump supporter and said he understands the administration's desire to reduce trade imbalances.",
      "\u201cLet's just get the deals done and stop all this because (Trump's) disrupting Christmas,\u201d he said.",
      "Although American Girl launched in 1986 with a line based on fictional historical characters, the dolls never were domestic products. They were made in Germany before production eventually moved to China.",
      "Toy experts say that in addition to lower costs, Chinese factories have developed techniques and expertise that are not easily replicated.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have any capacity in the U.S. to make rooted doll hair. And then you\u2019ve got things like the faces. Some of them are hand-painted, others are done with a Tampo (printing) machine,\u201d James Zahn, editor-in-chief of industry publication The Toy Book, said of doll-making.",
      "Hornsby said rooting the synthetic hair onto the heads of Decora Girlz dolls is carried out by skilled workers at factories in Guangzhou and Dongguan, China.",
      "\u201cIt's not just sticking into a machine and it automatically does it,\" he said. \u201dYou have to know what you\u2019re doing in order to make that doll look like it\u2019s got a full set of hair when literally maybe only 60% of the head is filled with hair.\"",
      "White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said last week that he assumes consumers would prefer to pay more for American-made products. Dolls made in China might have lead paint in them, he said.",
      "Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said the picture is more complicated.",
      "Products for children ages 12 and under require third-party testing and certification from labs approved by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing lead levels in toys, Murray said.",
      "The rules apply to all products sold in the U.S. Toys by major brands such as Fisher-Price, Mattel, Hasbro and Lego, which have long outsourced manufacturing to China, are usually in compliance, she said.",
      "But the rise of online shopping, including e-commerce platforms that ship directly to U.S. consumers from overseas, has posed a challenge, according to Murray. When valued at less than $800, such parcels entered the U.S. duty-free and were not subject to the same scrutiny as bulk imports, she said.",
      "The White House eliminated the customs exemption starting May 2 for low-value parcels that originated in mainland China and Hong Kong. U.S Customs and Border Protection expects additional oversight will make it easier to flag problems.",
      "Toy companies and industry experts argue the high tariffs on Chinese imports will tempt price-sensitive shoppers to search for cheap counterfeit toys that carry higher safety risks.",
      "Plenty of people agree American consumer culture has gotten out of hand, in large part due to prices kept low through the labor of foreign factory workers who earn much less than they would in the U.S.",
      "Katie Walley-Wiegert, 38, a senior marketer in Richmond, Virginia, and the parent of a 2-year-old son, agrees there\u2019s too much materialism but thinks parents should have choices when deciding what is best for their children. She found the wealthy Trump\u2019s comments off-putting.",
      "\u201cI think it is a small view of what purchase habits and realities are for people who buy toys for kids,\u201d Walley-Wiegert said.",
      "San Francisco resident Elenor Mak, who founded the Jilly Bing doll company after she couldn't find an Asian American doll for her daughter, Jillian, now 5, said the president's remarks upset her because some families struggle to buy even one doll.",
      "The trade war with China \u201cjust makes it even more impossible for those families,\u201d Mak said.",

      "Leading aid organizations are triaging aid after countries led by the U.S. funnel less money to foreign assistance",
      "WASHINGTON -- As the world's humanitarian organizations are triaging their shrinking amount of funding, the head of the International Rescue Committee stresses that the choice is stark: Keeping millions alive in the most vulnerable countries will require pulling some assistance for programs in better-off countries that target everything from climate change to refugee resettlement.",
      "Life-saving food, water and health programs already are shutting down in countries including Sudan, where the closing of 80% of communal kitchens has ended the only access to food for millions. That comes after the Trump administration dissolved the lead U.S. aid agency and terminated thousands of foreign assistance programs.",
      "\u201cThere are lives on the line,\u201d David Miliband, president of the IRC, told The Associated Press in an interview this week in Washington, where he also was speaking to lawmakers and Trump administration officials.",
      "\u201cOur point is there's no way you can keep the aid system as it was,\u201d said Miliband, a former U.K. foreign secretary. As it was, he notes, only 14% of total aid was going to humanitarian efforts, while middle-income countries got more funding than low-income ones.",
      "The triage underway shows the impact of the Trump administration decision to pull the U.S. back from being the world\u2019s single largest aid donor. The United States previously provided about a third of the more than $200 billion in foreign assistance given annually by governments worldwide. The White House last week proposed a budget for next year with an 84% cut to such funding.",
      "Other important European donors, including Britain, say they also are cutting aid as they work to free up more money for defense spending, fearing U.S. changes in European defense commitments.",
      "Miliband and his International Rescue Committee are more explicit than some aid groups in offering their ideas for change in leaner funding times. Countries that are doing OK or are downright wealthy should have some of their donor funding redirected, so it can go to the range of needs of poor countries most affected by war and climate change.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a guideline, I would say at least half the global aid budget needs to go to conflict states,\u201d Miliband said. That\u2019s up from about a quarter of total aid now.",
      "Miliband points to climate mitigation in wealthier countries and help for newly arrived refugees to settle in wealthier countries as programs that should be lower priorities for donors in the current harsh aid environment.",
      "With the dust settling from the Trump cuts, aid organizations are looking at how to reorganize to focus on the most vital and strategic aid, said Kate Phillips-Barrasso, a vice president of Mercy Corps, another top humanitarian organization.",
      "\u201cMy fear is that we're going to end up in a world\u201d where donors split their efforts between two poles: arranging financing for infrastructure and economic development in middle-income countries or paying for only the most basic aid \u201chelping people not die\u201d in poor countries, Phillips-Barrasso said.",
      "\u201cI worry about pretty much everything in the middle disappearing,\u201d she said. That would leave the very poorest and most fragile countries never getting the help they need to get ahead of climate change and other threats.",
      "For Miliband and the IRC, donors should focus on getting humanitarian aid, climate help and other vital assistance to 13 poor countries struggling the most with conflicts and environmental damage. That includes Afghanistan, where the Trump administration has cut aid on the grounds that it could benefit the Taliban, and Yemen, where the U.S. recently reached a ceasefire with Houthi militants, who have been targeting global shipping.",
      "The other countries that the IRC identifies as priorities for the shrinking pool of aid funding are Haiti, Burkina Faso, the Central African Republic, Chad, Mali, Mozambique, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s cuts already have forced top aid organizations to pull out of entire countries. Groups say that endangers the progress many countries in Africa and elsewhere have made and threatens further destabilization and extremist gains in volatile regions, including the southern edge of the Sahara.",

      "A former CEO of the nation\u2019s largest waste management company who currently serves on the FedEx board of directors will take over control of the U.S. Postal Service",
      "David Steiner, a former CEO of the nation\u2019s largest waste management company who currently serves on the FedEx board of directors, is poised to take over control of the U.S. Postal Service, becoming the nation\u2019s 76th postmaster general.",
      "The announcement of Steiner's appointment, which drew immediate concerns from postal unions over possible efforts to privatize the USPS, was made Friday by Amber McReynolds, chairperson of the USPS' Board of Governors, during a meeting of the independent group that oversees the service.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate that Mr. Steiner will join the organization in July, assuming his successful completion of the ethics and security clearance processes that are currently underway,\u201d McReynolds said.",
      "Friday\u2019s announcement by the the Board of Governors comes as President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency have raised the idea of privatizing the nearly 250-year-old Postal Service, which has faced financial challenges amid a changing mail mix and other issues.",
      "The choice of Steiner has been seen by the postal unions as a harbinger for possible privatization of some or all of the venerable quasi-public institution, which is largely self-funded and has a mission to serve every address in the country \u2014 nearly 167 million residences, businesses and post office boxes.",
      "Postal unions have held protests throughout the country over potential privatization, job cuts and possibly ending the universal service obligation.",
      "Brian L. Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said Steiner is not just any executive from the private sector but someone who sits on the board of one of the Postal Service\u2019s top competitors.",
      "\u201cHis selection isn\u2019t just a conflict of interest \u2014 it\u2019s an aggressive step toward handing America\u2019s mail system over to corporate interests,\u201d Renfroe said in a statement. \u201cPrivate shippers have been waiting to get USPS out of parcel delivery for years. Steiner\u2019s selection is an open invitation to do just that.\u201d",
      "Renfroe\u2019s union represents 205,000 active city letter carriers and around 90,000 retirees.",
      "Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents more than 220,000 USPS employees and retirees, likened the appointment of Steiner to a fox guarding a hen house.",
      "\u201cFedEx has a very different agenda than the public postal service. And they\u2019re a major competitor of the United States Postal Service,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about any attributes of an individual, but to me, that\u2019s the last type of person you will put in charge of the public institution as the anchor of the mailing package industry in the country.\u201d",
      "Steiner, who will leave the FedEx board, said in a written statement that he admires the public service mission of the USPS and called it \u201can incredible honor to be asked to lead the world\u2019s greatest postal organization.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe strongly in maintaining its role as an independent establishment of the executive branch,\u201d said Steiner, who served as CEO of Waste Management Inc. from 2004 through October 2016.",
      "In a written statement, McReynolds called Steiner \"the right person to lead the Postal Service at this time to ensure this magnificent and historic organization thrives into the future.\u201d",
      "\u201cDave is a highly regarded leader and executive with tremendous vision, experience and skill that can be applied to the long-term mission and business needs of the Postal Service,\" she added. \"Our Board looks forward to working with Dave as he takes on the core mandates of providing universal and excellent service for the American public and doing so in a financially sustainable manner.\u201d",
      "The Postal Service is in the midst of a 10-year modernization and cost-cutting plan that began in 2021 under Postmaster Louis DeJoy, who resigned in March. The plan is an attempt to stop losses at the agency, which has a budget of about $78 billion a year and is mostly self-funded, including through stamps and packages.",
      "Known as \u201cDeliver for America,\u201d the initiative has received markedly mixed reviews. While postal officials contend it has led to major efficiency improvements, some members of Congress have criticized it for leading to mail delays, unsustainable postage increases and declines in business.",
      "Besides privatization, there\u2019s also been talk of possibly moving the USPS under the control of the U.S. Department of Commerce.",
      "The choice of Steiner was first reported by The Washington Post.",

      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in March, without providing evidence, that investigations found that Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a U.S.-designated terrorist group.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Attorneys for Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were convicted of killing their parents in 1989, will make their case to a judge Friday that Los Angeles prosecutors should be removed from the brothers' resentencing case.",
      "The brothers were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison without the possibility of parole for fatally shooting their entertainment executive father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills home. The brothers were 18 and 21 at the time of the killings. Defense attorneys argued the brothers acted out of self-defense after years of sexual abuse by their father, while prosecutors said the brothers killed their parents for a multimillion-dollar inheritance.",
      "Former LA County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n had opened the door to possible freedom for the brothers in October by requesting their sentences be reduced to 50 years with the possibility of parole. His office said the case would've been handled differently today due to modern understandings of sexual abuse and trauma, and that the brothers had rehabilitated during their 30 years in prison.",
      "But current district attorney Nathan Hochman has reversed course and opposes the brothers' resentencing. Hochman has said the brothers have not taken full responsibility for their crimes because they have not admitted to lies told during their trials. The Menendez family and lawyers have been heavily critical of the way Hochman has handled the case.",
      "Hochman\u2019s office filed a motion to oppose his removal from the case, dismissing the defense\u2019s concerns as simply \u201cnot being happy\u201d with prosecutors\u2019 opinion on resentencing.",
      "\u201cDisagreeing with the opposing side\u2019s position is not a conflict of interest, it is simply a disagreement,\u201d it said.",
      "While Hochman's conduct is the focus of defense attorneys' petition, they want the case entirely removed from the Los Angeles district attorney's office, in which case the state attorney general's office would usually step in.",
      "However, California Attorney General Rob Bonta filed a motion this week siding with Hochman, saying the defense had not adequately demonstrated a conflict of interest.",
      "Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, said these types of recusal requests are \u201calmost never\u201d granted.",
      "\u201cDefendants don\u2019t usually get to pick their prosecutors,\u201d she said. \u201cOccasionally an individual prosecutor will be recused, but to recuse an entire office is very rare.\u201d",
      "Generally, this only happens if a prosecutor's personal family member is involved or if the district attorney's office received outside payment in a case, Levenson said.",
      "During long-awaited resentencing hearings last month, attorneys engaged in a heated debate over whether material from risk assessments completed by the state parole board at the governor\u2019s order should be admissible in court. The hearings were delayed, and the brothers' lead attorney Mark Geragos said he would move to recuse Hochman from the case.",
      "In a motion filed April 25, Geragos argued that Hochman's bias against the brothers and mistreatment of the Menendez family posed a \u201cgenuine risk\u201d the brothers would not receive a fair hearing.",
      "He pointed to Hochman's demotion of Nancy Theberge and Brock Lunsford, the two deputy district attorneys who filed the original resentencing motion. Theberge and Lunsford have since filed lawsuits against Hochman alleging they were punished for their work on the Menendez case.",
      "Hochman also hired Kathleen Cady, who represented Milton Andersen, the only Menendez family member who opposed the brothers' resentencing at the time, to head his Office of Victim Services. Andersen died in March.",
      "Geragos said no one from the victim services office had ever reached out to the Menendez family to offer support. In mid-April, both Cady and Hochman were present at an organization's rally to condemn the Menendez brothers' resentencing, he said.",
      "Finally, Geragos said the district attorney's office had violated Marsy's Law, which ensures victims in California are treated with fairness and respect.",
      "Menendez cousin Tamara Goodell filed a complaint with the U.S. Attorney's Office in which she wrote Hochman used a \u201chostile, dismissive, and patronizing tone\u201d that left the family \u201cdistressed and feeling humiliated.\u201d",
      "Hochman's motion said the defense had not presented any proof that hiring Cady, a seasoned prosecutor and attorney, prevented his office from treating the Menendez brothers fairly, and that the reassignments of Theberge and Lunsford were \u201cinternal staffing decisions.\"",
      "Marsy's Law also does not give victims the right to seek the removal of a prosecutor, the motion said.",
      "The Menendez brothers are still waiting for the full results of a state parole board risk assessment ordered by Gov. Gavin Newsom\u2019s office. The final hearing, scheduled for June 13, will influence whether Newsom grants the brothers clemency.",

      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- An Iranian mechanical engineering student at the University of Alabama has decided to self-deport after six weeks in a Louisiana detention center despite the government dropping a charge behind his initial arrest, his lawyer and fiancee said.",
      "Alireza Doroudi was detained by immigration officials in March as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s widespread immigration crackdown and has been held at a facility in Jena, Louisiana, over 300 miles (480 kilometers) from where he lived with his fiancee in Alabama.",
      "At the time the State Department said Doroudi posed \u201csignificant national security concerns.\u201d",
      "Doroudi\u2019s lawyer, David Rozas, said the government has not offered any evidence to support that claim, however.",
      "Doroudi\u2019s visa was revoked in June 2023. Officials did not give a reason and ignored numerous inquiries from him that year, according to his fiancee, Sama Ebrahimi Bajgani.",
      "Back then the University of Alabama advised Doroudi that he was legally allowed to stay but would not be allowed to re-enter if he left, Bajgani added.",
      "This spring the government filed two charges against Doroudi to justify deporting him, saying his visa was revoked and he was not \u201cin status\u201d as a student, Rozas said.",
      "On Thursday a U.S. government attorney withdrew the first of those and said the visa revocation was \u201cprudential,\u201d meaning it would not go into effect until after he leaves the country \u2014 in line with what the university told Doroudi earlier.",
      "Rozas said he has submitted evidence disputing the remaining accusation, that he is not an active student.",
      "A State Department spokesperson declined to comment on the case, including Rozas\u2019 characterization of the initial arrest as an error.",
      "The judge in the case, Maithe Gonzalez, gave both sides until the end of May to refile motions and denied Doroudi\u2019s request to redetermine eligibility for bond. Doroudi decided to give up rather than continue to fight deportation.",
      "\u201cHe told me that if they let him to go out, there was a good chance that he would have fought his case for the sake of other students and for the sake of himself,\u201d Bajgani said afterward by phone. \u201cThey just want to make him tired so he can deport himself.\u201d",
      "Bajgani, who drove 11 hours round-trip to attend the hourlong hearing, echoed Rozas\u2019 confusion about why Doroudi was targeted for deportation, saying he has no criminal record, entered the country legally and was not politically outspoken like other students who have been targeted.",
      "She affectionately described her fiance as a \u201cnerd\u201d and \u201ca really big thinker\u201d who spent long days in the lab and enjoys anime. He does not deserve what happened to him, she said, and now the life they built in Alabama is over.",
      "\u201cI am not happy about the whole thing that happened to us, and I need time to grieve for what I am going to put behind and leave,\u201d Bajgani said. \u201cAll the dreams, friendships and dreams we had with each other.\u201d",

      "Alabama plans to carry out its latest execution using nitrogen gas next month",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- Alabama plans to carry out another execution by nitrogen gas and has set a June execution date for a man convicted of the 1988 killing of a woman.",
      "Gregory Hunt is scheduled to be put to death June 10 for the 1988 beating death of Karen Lane. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday announced the execution date following authorization by the Alabama Supreme Court.",
      "Alabama last year became the first state to carry out an execution with nitrogen gas. Nitrogen has now been used in five executions \u2014 four in Alabama and one in Louisiana.  The method involves using a gas mask to force a person to breathe pure nitrogen gas, depriving them of the oxygen needed to stay alive.",
      "If the execution goes forward, Hunt would be the sixth person put to death by the new execution method.",
      "Lane was found dead on Aug. 2, 1988, in the Cordova apartment she shared with another woman. Hunt had been dating the victim, Lane, for about one month before her death, according to court records.",
      "Prosecutors said Hunt broke into her apartment and killed her. A physician who performed an autopsy testified that Lane had sustained some 60 injuries, including 20 to the head.",
      "A jury in 1990 convicted Hunt of capital murder and recommended by a vote of 11-1 that he receive a death sentence.",
      "The Alabama attorney general\u2019s office, in a motion seeking the execution date, wrote there was no doubt about his guilt and said that Hunt had admitted to his cellmate that he killed Lane. Lawyers for Hunt had asked the court to wait on an execution date. They argued that a February U.S. Supreme Court decision could be applicable to his longstanding claim that his conviction was unconstitutionally obtained by false or misleading evidence.",
      "Hunt had named nitrogen as his preferred method. The selection was made before Alabama had developed procedures for using gas. Alabama also allows to choose lethal injection or the electric chair.",
      "If the execution goes forward, it would be the third execution in Alabama this year.",

      "Catholic Chicagoans gathered in churches, cheered from classrooms and celebrated from their homes as the historic decision was announced that a native son, Cardinal Robert Prevost, had been elected pope",
      "CHICAGO -- After white smoke billowed Thursday from the Sistine Chapel, signaling that a pope had been chosen, students in every classroom at The Frances Xavier Warde School in Chicago had their eyes glued to TV screens.",
      "As the image of the new pope, Chicago native Cardinal Robert Prevost, appeared onscreen, cheers erupted through the hallways. Children jumped out of their seats, pumping their hands in the air.",
      "\u201cOur students are just beside themselves,\" said Mary Perrotti, director of advancement at the school. \u201cThey\u2019re beyond excited and can\u2019t believe a Chicagoan is their new pope. They were in awe.\u201d",
      "Prevost, 69, took the name Leo XIV and replaced Pope Francis, who died last month. The first American elected pontiff, Pope Leo XIV was born and raised in Chicago before undertaking his ministry in Peru. Catholic Chicagoans gathered in churches and celebrated from their homes as the historic decision was announced.",
      "\u201cOur young people have a model now of a leader with justice and compassion at the heart of his ministries \u2014 and who is from their home,\u201d Perrotti said. \"It\u2019s such a deep feeling of connection for them.\u201d",
      "Prevost was born in 1955 in the south side Chicago neighborhood of Bronzeville and grew up in suburban Dolton, where he attended Mass and elementary school at St. Mary of the Assumption.",
      "He later studied theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago in Hyde Park and taught in local Catholic schools, including at St. Rita High School, according to the school.",
      "\u201cWe are overjoyed that someone who is beloved and known to us is now the beloved leader of the whole entire church,\u201d said Barbara Reid, a Dominican sister and president of the Catholic Theological Union.",
      "John Doughney, a fellow St. Mary\u2019s grade school graduate from 1969, remembers Prevost as a \u201cfriend to everyone\u201d and a \u201ckind, caring, compassionate young man.\u201d",
      "\u201cEven when he was 12 and 13, it was apparent to all of us that he knew what his calling was,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would\u2019ve shocked all of us if he didn\u2019t go into the priesthood. We\u2019re so proud of him.\u201d",
      "Linda Eickmann, 62, was also born and raised in Dalton and attended St. Mary's. When she saw the news of the new pope on TV, she screamed with joy.",
      "\u201cHow cool is that?\" she said. \"A pope from my elementary school, from my town. It\u2019s unreal.\u201d",
      "Eickmann remembered Prevost's family as being so deeply involved in the St. Mary's community that everyone knew their names. They ran sloppy joe sales to raise money for the school, and all their sons were altar boys, including Prevost.",
      "Raul Raymundo, co-founder of a local community advocacy group called the Resurrection Project, said Thursday was a proud day for Chicagoans and he hoped Pope Leo XIV will \"continue Pope Francis\u2019 legacy and Chicago\u2019s legacy of social justice and compassion, especially in welcoming immigrants.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tears of joy, of hope, of motivation to rise to this moment and leave this world better than we found it,\" said Raymundo, an immigrant from Mexico who grew up in Chicago's Pilsen neighborhood.",
      "At Holy Name Cathedral, about two dozen people gathered to pray as light filtered in through the stained glass windows.",
      "Kneeling in a pew, Laurel Legle said she isn't Catholic or even Christian but felt she had to be there after the new American pope's election was announced. She called it a \u201cprofound moment.\u201d",
      "Zo\u00eb Poehlman, a nurse who moved from Kansas City to Chicago a few months ago, described the mood as exciting and hopes there will be citywide celebrations. \u201cIt was just so crazy,\u201d she said.",
      "Father Gregory Sakowicz, the cathedral's rector, said that when the new pope was announced, the sun came out \u2014 a coincidence he described as \u201cGod\u2019s way of remaining anonymous.\u201d He said he was \u201chappily shocked,\u201d and that he had a burning question: Whether the new Pope was a White Sox fan?",
      "When a journalist in the crowd said she\u2019d heard Pope Leo XIV is a Cubs fan, Sakowicz chuckled. \u201cGod bless him,\u201d he said. It turns out he's a Sox fan.",
      "On social media, people swapped memes about Chicago staples \u2014 deep-dish and tavern-style pizza, the Chicago liqueur Mal\u00f6rt and baseball, reflecting the civic pride of Chicago residents as they claimed the pope as one of their own.",
      "Google search traffic for \u201cDa Pope\u201d skyrocketed, and a local T-shirt company announced it would sell \u201cDa Pope\u201d shirts with a blue-and-orange Bears-themed design. Chicagoans overlayed Chicago Bulls intro music to video of the pope exiting the Vatican.",
      "Some joked about replacing communion wafers and wine with tavern-style pizza and Mal\u00f6rt. And the Chicago fast food chain Portillo's jested about shipping its Italian beef to Vatican City.",
      "Many users also proclaimed hope the new pope would represent Chicago's history of social justice.",

      "Two advocacy groups filed a federal lawsuit Thursday asking the courts to halt new Trump Administration vetting procedures for reuniting children who crossed into the U.S. without their parents, saying the changes are keeping families separated longer and are inhumane.",
      "The lawsuit was filed by the National Center for Youth Law and Democracy Forward in federal court in the District of Columbia. It names the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and its Office of Refugee Resettlement and seeks a return to prior reunification procedures.",
      "Critics note the government data shows the average time that the children are held in custody before release by the Office of Refugee Resettlement to their sponsors grew from 37 days in January to over 112 days by March.",
      "In February, the Trump administration changed the way it reviews sponsors who want to care for migrant children in government custody, whether parents or relatives of the minors -- or others. More changes followed in March and April when the government started to require identification or proof of income that only those legally present in the U.S. could acquire. Advocates for the families affected are asking a judge to declare the changes unlawful and return the agency to the policies in place before that.",
      "\u201cThe government has dramatically increased the burden on families in a way that deeply undermines children\u2019s safety. These policy changes are part of a broader unraveling of a bi-partisan, decades-long commitment to support the best interests of unaccompanied children,\u201d said Neha Desai, a managing director at National Center for Youth Law.",
      "Attorneys said they had heard from families who were moments away from receiving their children back when the rules were abruptly changed. Now, many say they are left waiting indefinitely.",
      "\u201cThe administration has reversed years of established children\u2019s welfare protections and replaced them with fear, prolonged detention, and bureaucratic cruelty,\u201d said Skye Perryman, president of Democracy Forward in a statement.",
      "One Mexican woman who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because of fears of deportation said she and her 8-year-old son were led to believe repeatedly that they would be reunited, only to find out the new policy changes would derail their plans.",
      "The mother, who arrived first across the border from Mexico, has noticed her son lose hope over the last 11 months, even refusing to unpack after the last time he thought his release from a government-run shelter was imminent.",
      "\u201cHe's seen so many children who have come, leave, and he's stayed behind,\" said the mother, who wasn't part of the lawsuit.",
      "The Trump administration says it is increasing scrutiny of parents and other sponsors before giving them custody of their children who have crossed the border as unaccompanied minors.",
      "HHS did not immediately respond to emails from AP seeking comment in response to the lawsuit filed Thursday afternoon.",
      "Similar restrictions were imposed in 2018 under Trump's first presidency during the rollout of a zero-tolerance policy that separated families and required fingerprinting for all members of a household receiving a child. The administration scaled back the requirements after custody times increased.",

    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\".",
      "US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.",
      "It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.",
      "Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.",
      "But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.",
      "US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.",
      "With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.",
      "\"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says.",
      "Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.",
      "Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.",
      "By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.",
      "Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.",
      "Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.",
      "Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said.",
      "However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.",
      "Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.",
      "Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.",
      "\"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\"",
      "When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US.",
      "'End of an era'",
      "Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.",
      "\"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.",
      "She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.",
      "\"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.",

      "Top trade officials from both sides will meet on Saturday in the first high-level meeting since US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in January.",
      "Beijing retaliated immediately and a tense stand-off ensued as the two countries heaped levies on each other. New US tariffs on Chinese imports stand at 145%, and some US exports to China face duties of 125%.",
      "There have been weeks of stern, and sometimes fiery, rhetoric where each side sought to paint the other as the more desperate party.",
      "And yet this weekend they will face each other over the negotiating table.",
      "So why now?",
      "Saving face",
      "Despite multiple rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock. Except it wasn't clear who would blink first.",
      "\"Neither side wants to appear to be backing down,\" said Stephen Olson, senior visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and a former US trade negotiator.",
      "\"The talks are taking place now because both countries have judged that they can move forward without appearing to have caved in to the other side.\"",
      "Still, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian emphasised on Wednesday that \"the talks are being held at the request of the US\".",
      "And the commerce ministry framed it as a favour to Washington, saying it was answering the \"calls of US businesses and consumers\".",
      "The Trump administration, however, claims it's Chinese officials who \"want to do business very much\" because \"their economy is collapsing\".",
      "\"They said we initiated? Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "But as the talks drew closer, the president struck a more diplomatic note: \"We can all play games. Who made the first call, who didn't make the - it doesn't matter,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"It only matters what happens in that room.\"",
      "The timing is also key for Beijing because it's during Xi's visit to Moscow. He was a guest of honour on Friday at Moscow's Victory Day parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World War Two victory over Nazi Germany.",
      "Xi stood alongside leaders from across the Global South - a reminder to Trump's administration that China not only has other options for trade, but it is also presenting itself as an alternative global leader.",
      "This allows Beijing to project strength even as it heads to the negotiating table.",
      "The pressure is on",
      "Trump insists that the tariffs will make America stronger, and Beijing has vowed to \"fight till the end\"- but the fact is the levies are hurting both countries.",
      "Factory output in China has taken a hit, according to government data. Manufacturing activity in April dipped to the lowest level since December 2023. And a survey by news outlet Caixin this week showed that services activity has reached a seven-month low.",
      "The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, with stock piling up in warehouses, even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US.",
      "\"I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal,\" says Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute in National University Singapore.",
      "\"So they've taken a pragmatic view and said, 'OK, well we need to get these talks going.'\"",
      "And so with the major May Day holiday in China over, officials in Beijing have decided the time is right to talk.",
      "On the other side, the uncertainty caused by tariffs led to the US economy contracting for the first time in three years.",
      "And industries that have long depended on Chinese-made goods are especially worried. A Los Angeles toy company owner told the BBC that they were \"looking at the total implosion of the supply chain\".",
      "Trump himself has acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting.",
      "American children may \"have two dolls instead of 30 dolls\", he said at a cabinet meeting this month, \"and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally\".",
      "Trump's approval ratings have also slid over fears of inflation and a possible recession, with more than 60% of Americans saying he was focusing too much on tariffs.",
      "\"Both countries are feeling pressure to provide a bit of reassurance to increasingly nervous markets, businesses, and domestic constituencies,\" Mr Olson says.",
      "\"A couple of days of meetings in Geneva will serve that purpose.\"",
      "What happens next?",
      "While the talks have been met with optimism, a deal may take a while to materialise.",
      "The talks will mostly be about \"touching base\", Mr Hofman said, adding that this could look like an \"exchange of positions\" and, if things go well, \"an agenda [will be] set for future talks\".",
      "The negotiations on the whole are expected to take months, much like what happened during Trump's first term.",
      "After nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs, the US and China signed a \"phase one\" deal in early 2020 to suspend or reduce some levies. Even then, it did not include thornier issues, such as Chinese government subsidies for key industries or a timeline for scrapping the remaining tariffs.",
      "In fact, many of them stayed in place through Joe Biden's presidency, and Trump's latest tariffs add to those older levies.",
      "What could emerge this time is a \"phase one deal on steroids\", Mr Olson said: that is, it would go beyond the earlier deal and try to address flashpoints. There are many, from the illegal fentanyl trade which Washington wants China to crack down harder on to Beijing's relationship with Moscow.",
      "But all of that is far down the line, experts warn.",
      "\"The systemic frictions that bedevil the US-China trade relationship will not be solved any time soon,\" Mr Olson adds.",

    "story": [
      "It's going to be a very sexy summer, a touch of romantic, cowboy and rock and roll.",
      "That's according to Mehdi Sousanne, at least. And he should know. He's a designer for Zara who helps create the clothes for a brand that's one of the most successful stories in High Street fashion.",
      "Zara is owned by Inditex, the world's biggest fashion retailer, which runs a string of store chains including Massimo Dutti and Pull & Bear.",
      "It relies on 1,800 suppliers across the world, but nearly all the clothes are brought to Spain where the company is based, to be despatched to stores in 97 countries.",
      "Zara doesn't advertise and rarely gives interviews. But as it marks 50 years since the opening of its first store, I've come to its vast campus in Galicia to meet the boss and workers for a rare glimpse into how the secretive brand operates.",
      "It's a time when the company finds itself having to navigate fast-changing markets, with growing competition from ultra-cheap online players Shein and Temu, who ship their goods direct from China, as well as uncertainty surrounding US tariffs.",
      "But Oscar Garcia Maceiras, Inditex's CEO, says US President Donald Trump's tariffs won't disrupt its supply chains or change Zara's plans to expand further in the US, now its second biggest market.",
      "\"Bear in mind that for us, diversification is key. We are producing in almost 50 different markets with non-exclusive suppliers so we are more than used to adapt ourselves to change,\" he tells me.",
      "The business has certainly adapted and grown since its first store opened a short drive away in the town of A Coruna.",
      "It now has 350 designers, with the staff coming from some 40 different countries.",
      "\"There are no rules in general. It's all about feelings,\" says Mehdi, who works on delivering the key pieces for the season.",
      "He says inspiration can come from anyone ranging from the \"street\" to the cinema\u00a0 as well as the catwalks. He likes to sketch his ideas once an all-important mood board has been created.",

      "In the pattern cutting room, the designs are turned into paper samples, and are pinned on to mannequins. Dozens of seamstresses then run up the first fabric samples on the spot for a first fitting.",
      "Pattern maker Mar Marcote has been with the business 42 years and still uses a magnifying glass to examine each item of clothing before it finally goes into production.",
      "\"When you finish the item and see that it looks good, and then sometimes sells out, it's marvellous,\" she says.",
      "Zara is a business that has changed the way we shop.",
      "In the old days, retailers released just two main collections a year, Spring/Summer and Autumn/Winter. For decades, most chains have outsourced manufacturing to lower-cost factories in the far east with the clothes arriving up to six months later.",
      "Zara went against conventional wisdom by sourcing a lot of its clothes closer to home and changing products much more frequently. That meant it could respond much faster to the latest trends and drop new items into stores every week.",
      "Just over half of its clothes are made in Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Turkey. There's a factory doing small production runs on site at HQ, with another seven nearby, which it also owns.",
      "As a result, it can turn around products in a matter of weeks.",
      "More basic fashion staples are produced with longer lead times in countries like Vietnam and Bangladesh.",
      "Logistics and data are other factors behind its success. Every piece of clothing is packaged and despatched from its distribution centres in Spain, as well as one in the Netherlands.",
      "\"What is absolutely critical is the level of accuracy,\" says CEO Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"It's something that allows us to make the right decision in the last possible minute, in order to assess properly the appetite from our customers, in order to adapt our fashion proposition to the profile of our customers in different locations.\"",
      "In other words, getting the right products to the right shops.",
      "At HQ, product managers then receive real-time data on how clothes are selling in stores worldwide, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 feedback from customers, which is then shared with designers and buyers, who can adjust the ranges along the season according to demand.",
      "Unlike some other High Street rivals, it only discounts when it stages its twice-yearly sales.",
      "But is Zara starting to lose its shine after posting slower sales growth at the start of this year?",
      "\"The key challenge for Inditex is continuing to be relevant in a fashion world that continues to get faster and cheaper,\" says William Woods, European retail analyst for Bernstein.",
      "Not only are mainstream rivals like H&M, Mango and Uniqlo trying to catch up, the market has been disrupted by Shein and Temu.",
      "Shein racked up $38bn in global sales last year, just a whisker behind Inditex.",
      "Asked how much of a threat Shein and Temu's success poses to Zara, Mr Maceiras stresses that its business model doesn't rely on price.",
      "\"Of course, we are looking at providing our customers our products at an affordable price. But for us, it's critical to provide customers fashion that should be inspirational, with quality, creativity and sustainable.\"",
      "Zara has come a long way since its founder Amancio Ortega started the business.",
      "The company is still majority-owned by his family and his daughter Marta is now chairwoman of the group.",
      "Now aged 89, Mr Ortega remains famously reclusive but still pops in, according to Mr Maceiras.",
      "\"He's a presence, a physical or moral presence, absolutely every day.\""

      "\"The actual substantive items that they negotiated are pretty narrow,\" said Stan Veuger, a senior fellow in economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \"In some sense you could say they basically took the status quo, made marginal changes and called it a deal.\"",

      "US and UK agree deal slashing Trump tariffs on cars and metals",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "What tariffs has Trump announced and why?",
      "The Trump administration, which has seen markets panic at its tariff announcements, was eager to sell the announcement as significant, describing it as a \"breakthrough\".",
      "In the UK, Sir Keir Starmer, who also has incentive to want to be seen as a solid negotiator, called it \"historic\", while noting there was more work to be done.",
      "Steelmakers and car firms in the UK did express relief, saying the tariff rollback would help save jobs.",
      "But it was hardly missed on anyone that despite progress, goods from the UK are still facing higher tariffs than they were a few weeks ago.",
      "In the US, most analysts agreed that substantive benefits would be limited, despite the two sides discussing trade on and off for nearly a decade.",
      "Mr Veuger noted that Trump in his first term was similarly willing to declare victory on deals with China, Mexico and Canada that experts likewise said would have narrow impact.",
      "\"I think for Trump the goal really is to have a deal and it doesn't really matter what it looks like in the substance, \" he said. \"It tells me it's not that hard to get to a deal but it also tells me there's not that much room to make changes.\"",
      "Thursday's announcements drew an unusually sharp rebuke from American carmakers, which noted that the plans made UK-made cars less expensive to import than many of the models made by their companies, which have operations in Mexico and Canada.",
      "Other analysts pounced on the irony of the president dismissing concerns that tariffs are driving up prices for dolls while he agrees to lower taxes on imported cars for the ultra-wealthy like Rolls-Royces and Bentleys, which are UK companies.",
      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said it welcomed the deal but other groups representing farmers, a key part of Trump's political base, were notably muted.",
      "The American Farm Bureau Federation called it an \"important first step\", while noting \"more work is needed\".",
      "\"This is a good deal for American farmers ... but it is at the end of the day a fairly narrowly-focused framework,\" said Lewis Lukens, former acting US Ambassador to the UK and deputy chief of mission to the US embassy in London during part of Trump's first term.",
      "\"It gives Trump a political victory with not too much really to show behind it.\"",
      "Republicans, traditionally a free-trade party, were quick to celebrate the achievement.",
      "Rep Adrian Smith, a Republican from Nebraska, who chairs a subcommittee on trade, told the BBC he was \"pleased\" over the initial trade pact.",
      "\"This is a significant step toward eliminating barriers to American products in foreign markets and friendshoring supply chains,\" he said, commending the administration for the swift negotiations, though noting he was happy to see details of the deal were still being negotiated \"to address additional concerns\".",
      "In a note to clients after the press conference, Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the announcement indicated \"rising desperation\" in the White House to ease its tariffs before they caused significant economic damage.",
      "But those economic risks are coming not from the UK, but America's relationship with China, which sent more than $400bn worth of goods to the US last year, more than six times that of the UK.",
      "Trump has hiked import taxes on Chinese products to at least 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with its own duties on American goods.",
      "Trade traffic between the two countries has dropped precipitously since last month, raising fears that the tariffs will lead not only to price rises, as had been widely predicted, but shortages as well.",
      "The two sides are set to have their first talks this weekend, but what will come out of them remain unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, the clock is ticking on a 90-day pause that Trump placed on some of the highest tariffs he had announced last month on partners such as the European Union, Vietnam and Cambodia.",
      "Earlier this week, Trump appeared testy when asked by reporters about his trade negotiations.",
      "\"Everyone says, 'When, when, when are you going to sign deals?'\" he said. \"I wish they'd ... stop asking.\"",
      "But it seems unlikely that this announcement with the UK will be the one to get the critics off his back.",

      "The key diplomatic win here is that it leaves the UK open to do a full EU deal on, for example, food standards.",
      "Economically this US deal is relatively small, although important to very specific sectors.",
      "It rolls back on some of the trade damage done by Trump's original announcement, in particular to the car industry. An insider told me the move from 27.5% to 10% would effectively save UK car exporters over \u00a31bn from what was an \"existential threat\" to the industry.",
      "While no longer existential, this remains painful. It is unclear how the quota will function, how it will account for foreign parts, for example, Chinese batteries, and is limited to 100,000 cars. JLR's much heralded new Jaguar was launched in the US with the hope of growing this number.",
      "The flip side of this is agricultural access for the US, for example, for beef, which is also subject to a quota. Other things were notable by their absence. There was no move on the digital service tax, or on tariffs for US cars.",
      "The biggest single decision, however, is the fact that the 10% so-called reciprocal tariff stays, even though the UK buys more from the US than the other way around. This confirms that the tariff is not negotiable for anybody, and could have wider consequences.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's White House slideshow appeared to point to a rather one sided \"deal\" where the UK had offered the US \"unprecedented access\" in order to save its car industry.",
      "The US had trebled tariffs on the UK from 3.4% to 10%, and the UK has cut its tariffs by two-thirds from 5.1% to 1.8%. It does not seem very \"reciprocal\".",
      "There is an important \"but\" here. The UK and US view these numbers through very different lenses.",
      "From the US perspective, the trebling of tariffs is a tax on foreigners that \"wins\" revenue for US Treasury. From the UK perspective, the tariff is a tax on domestic consumers that increases inflation, so a lower value is in and of itself good.",
      "Over at the Bank of England, the lack of retaliation and acceptance of diverted goods from Asia are among the reasons that inflation is now rising more gently, which has enabled today's interest rate cut with more to come.",
      "The Governor Andrew Bailey told me that he hoped the deal would mark the first of many which would calm global trade tensions.",
      "The real win here could be that this agreement on tariffs will keep the US sweet whilst leaving the door open to a substantive deal with the European Union.",
      "By maintaining UK food standards and not, for example, accepting hormone treated beef or chlorinated chicken, a \"full fat\" food and farm export deal with the EU, similar to Switzerland's, is now clearly on the cards in the next fortnight. This could slash post Brexit red tape for key exporters both ways.",
      "Then you have an overall picture of a growing economy, with good trade relations with the US, EU, India and soon the Gulf too, with rates being cut.",
      "The Government will try to project the UK as an oasis of trade and political stability in a tumultuous world, after years of turmoil. It is a world away from the recessionary negativity at the turn of the year, and it might just work.",

    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",
      "A lot of firms are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to whether the UK economy picks up before hiring and investing, it said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

    "story": [
      "Apple is asking an appeals court to pause a US district judge's recent ruling in a case which could determine the future of its highly lucrative App Store.",
      "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games.",
      "That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store.",
      "Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling \"core aspects of its business operations.\"",
      "\"A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,\" the company's lawyers wrote.",
      "Case origins",
      "Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games.",
      "In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases.",
      "The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules.",
      "She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem.",
      "Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead.",
      "In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.",
      "'Substantial sums'",
      "On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.",
      "The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful.",
      "\"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote.",
      "In response, Epic Games said Judge Gonzalez Rogers' contempt order last week was already benefitting consumers.",
      "\"Apple has faced a surge of genuine competition as developers have updated their apps with better payment methods, better deals, and better consumer choice,\" Epic wrote in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "The company criticized Apple's motion as \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\"",
      "Epic says it is on track with plans to bring Fortnite back to iPhones and iPads.",
      "Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store in 2020 after Epic unveiled an in-app payment system into the game.",
      "The move led to the current court battle between the two companies.",
      "Apple did not directly addresses Judge Gonzalez Rogers' stunning rebuke of company executives in its court filing.",
      "In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to.",
      "\"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote.",
      "The company documents she reviewed reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote.",
      "Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she would refer the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate if a criminal contempt proceeding against Apple is appropriate.",
      "Apple said last week it would comply with the court's order while it appeals.",

      "The decision marked the third in a row without action, leaving the bank's key lending rate hovering around 4.3%.",
      "Powell said if Trump's tariff policies remain in place they were likely \"to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in unemployment\".",
      "Typically, the Fed cuts rates if it believes the economy is struggling and raises them if prices start to rise too quickly.",
      "But the bank - which is set up to make policy independent of the White House -said tariffs had raised the risk of both an economic slowdown and faster price rises, complicating its next move.",

      "US-China trade",
      "Officials from the US and China are set to meet this week, but the scope of the talks remains unclear. Trump on Wednesday dismissed the idea of lowering tariff rates pre-emptively to help trade negotiations.",
      "Powell said the talks had the potential to change the economic picture \"materially\".",
      "\"Usually, things clarify and the appropriate direction becomes clear,\" he said. \"Right now it's very hard to say what that would be. In the meantime, the economy is doing fine.\"",
      "The US economy shrank in the first three months of the year for the first time since 2022. But officials said those figures had been distorted by firms rushing goods into the country ahead of tariffs rather than a decline in wider activity.",
      "Hiring remained unexpectedly strong last month, keeping the unemployment rate near historic lows of 4.2% while the US stock market has largely recovered from the sharp declines it saw last month.",
      "Powell said those figures gave the Fed time to wait.",

      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",
      "\"Today, there are a lot of risks to information and data,\" said Mr Bjerkstand. \"There is terrorism, war, cyber hackers.\"",
      "According to him, Svalbard is the perfect place, for hosting a secure data storage facility.",
      "\"It's far away from everything! Far away from wars, crisis, terrorism, disasters. What could be safer!\"",
      "Underground it's dark, dry and chilly, with temperatures remaining sub-zero all year-round; conditions which Mr Bjerkestrand claims are ideal for keeping the film safe for centuries.",
      "Should global warming cause the thick Arctic permafrost to thaw, the vault is still robust enough to preserve its contents he says.",
      "At the back of the chamber, another large metal box contains GitHub's Code Vault.",

      "His firm has explored a variety of long-term storage solutions, he said, and there are challenges. \"Some of our existing mechanisms can be stored for a very long time, but you need technology to read them.\"",
      "At Piql's headquarters in southern Norway, data files are encoded onto photosensitive film.",
      "\"Data is a sequence of bits and bytes,\" explains senior product developer, Alexey Mantsev, as film ran through a spool at his fingertips.",
      "\"We convert the sequence of the bits which come from our clients data into images. Every image [or frame] is about eight million pixels.\"",
      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",
      "That could mean the files and formats we use now, face a similar fate to the floppy disks and DVD drives of the past.",

    "summary": "The South American country is turning to wind power, but some local people are unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Jos\u00e9 Luis Iguar\u00e1n steps outside his home in La Guajira, northern Colombia, he is met with a line of 10 towering wind turbines stretching across the cactus-strewn terrain toward the Caribbean Sea.",
      "The Wayuu indigenous group, which Mr Iguar\u00e1n belongs to, has lived on the arid peninsula region for centuries, herding goats, tending to crops, mining salt, and fishing.",
      "With some of Colombia's most powerful winds, La Guajira has now become the epicentre of the country's shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "But this green ambition has faced both resistance and reflection from locals, whose territory is deeply tied to culture, tradition, and a profound connection to nature.",
      "\"You wake up and suddenly you no longer see the trees. Instead, you see and hear the turbines,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n says.",
      "His community now shares its land with Guajira 1 - one of Colombia's two operational wind farms. Another 15 wind farms are currently under construction in La Guajira, and there are plans for dozens more.",
      "\"At night, the noise from the turbines disturbs our dreams. For us, dreams are sacred,\" Mr Iguar\u00e1n adds.",
      "The Wayuu, who number around 380,000 in Colombia and extend into Venezuela, have distinct traditions and beliefs. Dreams are a bridge to the spiritual world, where they receive messages from their ancestors that are interpreted within the family.",
      "Despite the cultural disruptions, Mr Iguar\u00e1n says that his community has benefited from Guajira 1. The energy company behind it, Colombian firm Isagen, has paid for them to have access to clean drinking water, better roads, and sturdy brick houses, which have replaced some of the mud and cactus ones.",
      "Isagen, which is owned by Canada's Brookfield, also pays three local communities an annual fee for the wind farm to be there, a percentage of annual electricity revenues, and 20% from the sale of carbon credits. These are bought by companies wishing to offset their carbon emissions.",
      "Mr Iguar\u00e1n believes such energy projects can help bring vital development to Colombia's second-poorest region. But not everyone shares his enthusiasm.",
      "\"The wind farms produce clean energy, but they create division within the Wayuu communities,\" explains Aaron Laguna, a Wayuu fisherman, who lives in the coastal village of Cabo de la Vela.",
      "His community is currently in the process of consultations over a wind farm due to be built nearby. He has seen others affected by projects complain about a lack of transparency, poor compensation, a disrespect of cultural norms, and corruption.",
      "\"Bad negotiations are made, and the resources given [to us] aren't well managed by locals,\" he adds.",
      "These concerns have led to disputes with the energy companies, and even conflict within Wayuu communities. Some oppose the projects, while others feel excluded from negotiations that could bring them benefits.",
      "\"There is still this idea that if it is green, it is automatically good,\" says Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Colombian think tank Indepaz. It has extensively researched the energy transition and its effects on the Wayuu.",
      "\"In Colombia\u2026 there isn't a solid legal framework to properly assess the environmental impacts - and the social impacts are immeasurable.\"",
      "In December 2024, Spanish company EDP Renov\u00e1veis shelved plans for two wind farms in La Guajira, saying the projects were no longer economically viable.",
      "One factor was the doubling of local indigenous communities who said they would be affected, and therefore need compensation, from 56 to 113.",
      "EDP's decision followed the May 2023 exit of Italian multinational Enel from another planned wind farm in the region. Enel attributed its departure to \"constant protests\" that halted construction for more than half of the working days between 2021 and 2023.",
      "Guajira 1 was also marred by roadblocks, a common way of protesting in La Guajira when locals feel unheard.",
      "And think tank Indepaz has recorded cases of attacks against employees of the energy firms, including armed robberies and kidnappings. And in some areas it has found cases of displacement and violence between local communities who disagree over neighbouring wind farms.",
      "\"We call it the 'wind wars',\" says Ms Barney.",
      "For Colombian anthropologist Wieldler Guerra, there is a clear disconnect between the Wayuu and the wind farm companies.",
      "\"There are two worlds talking, and they have not managed to understand each other,\" he says.",
      "This gap extends to the very way they perceive the wind - the element central to these projects.",
      "\"For the Wayuu, the winds are people. It is not the wind, but the winds. There are eight different winds in Wayuu culture, mythological and ancestral beings with distinct temperaments that shape the surrounding environment and must be respected.\"",
      "By contrast, companies and the Colombian government see wind as a resource to harness for environmental progress, profit, and to address the country's energy needs.",
      "While Colombia has a relatively clean domestic electricity matrix, with nearly two-thirds coming from hydroelectricity, the country remains vulnerable to low reservoir levels, which creates a risk of energy shortages. Wind energy currently contributes just 0.1% of the energy mix.",
      "For energy companies investing in the region, the risk of conflicts with local people are a worrying prospect.",
      "One such firm, AES Colombia is developing the country's largest wind energy cluster in La Guajira, with six wind farms.",
      "The company insists it maintains an open dialogue with communities, offering fair compensation, and ensuring benefits such as clean drinking water and shares in carbon credits.",
      "But it says good community relations are not enough.",
      "\"We cannot do these projects alone,\" says Federico Echavarr\u00eda, general manager of AES Colombia. \"The government must help resolve conflicts between communities.\"",
      "On the windswept beach in Cabo de la Vela, Mr Laguna says La Guajira has historically been neglected by the state.",
      "Education and healthcare are poor, and most rural communities do not have running water.",
      "Some people still walk hours each day to collect water from jag\u00fceys \u2013 reservoirs filled with rainwater.",
      "His community has a small salt-water treatment plant that produces fresh water and it wants the company planning to build the nearby wind farm to expand it, so that more locals benefit.",
      "Despite the talk of progress, he points to a lingering paradox. \"The worst thing is we won't receive even a single kilowatt of the electricity produced here,\" he laments.",
      "The plan is for the wind farm's electricity to instead be sent elsewhere, and that the village will continue to rely on generators, at least in the medium term.",
      "While the future might look bright for clean energy, many Wayuu are still anxious they will be left in the dark."

    "summary": "The Bank cuts rates for the second time this year, saying the slowdown in inflation was behind the move.",
    "story": [
      "UK interest rates have been cut to 4.25% from 4.5% and the governor of the Bank England has hinted more could follow in the coming months.",
      "Andrew Bailey said he would not \"give predictions as to when and how much\", but said he was \"still of the view that the path, gradually and carefully, is downwards\".",
      "The reduction in rates on Thursday marks the fourth cut within the past year and the Bank considered an even bigger cut to 4% due to concerns the global trade war could hit UK economic growth.",
      "Mr Bailey welcomed a UK-US deal on tariffs and said it was \"important as a signal, I hope, of many more to come\", adding a UK trade deal with the European Union would be \"beneficial\".",
      "\"Maybe we need a bit of a jolt to the system to remind us that trade is important,\" Mr Bailey said, adding he hoped the likes of deals between the UK and US, and the UK and India, would help to \"rebuild the world trading system\".",
      "On Thursday, the UK and US announced a deal to avoid tariffs on certain goods in order to boost trade.",
      "As it announced the latest cut in interest rates, the Bank said that while a trade war could hit economic growth, it could lead to lower inflation in the UK over time as countries such as China look to divert cheap goods originally bound for America.",
      "Mr Bailey said the path for rates was \"downwards\", but said future rate cuts were likely to be \"gradual and careful\".",
      "The minutes of the Bank's meeting showed the rate-setting committee was divided. Of the nine members, five voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.",
      "The Bank's base interest rate dictates the rates set by High Street banks and lenders. The higher level in recent years has meant people are paying more to borrow money for things like mortgages and credit cards, but savers have also received better returns.",
      "More than eight in 10 customers have fixed-rate deals, but could continue to face higher repayment costs when renewing.",
      "However, mortgage rates have been edging down recently, primarily because the markets and lenders expect further rate cuts this year.  On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 5.14%, while a five-year deal was 5.08%, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "About 600,000 homeowners have a mortgage that tracks the Bank's rate, so rates being cut will have an impact on monthly repayments.",
      "A typical tracker mortgage-holder is likely to see about \u00a329 knocked off their monthly repayments following the latest cut, said the banking trade body UK Finance.",
      "Homeowner Vanda, who has a tracker, told the BBC she had a \"really good rate\", but then got \"caught out\" when rates were previously increased.",
      "\"A drop would help because I've just been made redundant, so that would help a wee bit. I don't think it will ever go back to the way it was, though,\" she said.",
      "Interest rates are the Bank's main tool in try to maintain the annual rate of inflation at, or close to, its target of 2%.",
      "The most recent UK inflation figures show prices rose 2.6% in the year to March. However, the rate is expected to jump following a series of household bill increases at the start of April \u2013 including energy and water prices.",
      "The Bank said it expected inflation to rise \"temporarily\" to 3.5% this year due to the bill increases before falling back due lower oil and gas prices set to feed through in the coming months.",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "UK inflation rate: How quickly are prices rising?",
      "The theory behind increasing interest rates to tackle inflation is that by making borrowing more expensive, more people will cut back on spending and that leads to demand for goods falling and price rises easing.",
      "But it is a balancing act as high interest rates can harm the economy as businesses hold off on investing in production and jobs.",
      "The Bank expects UK growth for the first three months of this year to be stronger than it originally forecast at 0.6%, boosted by US firms stockpiling goods ahead of Trump's tariffs coming into effect. The official figures are set to be released next week.",
      "A boost in growth would be welcome news to the government, which has made growing the economy its main priority in order to boost living standards.",
      "The government's Budget decision to increase National Insurance last month for employers kicked in last month, but the Bank said the effect of the tax increase \"appears to have been fairly small to date\", though it added business confidence had taken a hit in recent months.",
      "A lot of firms are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to whether the UK economy picks up before hiring and investing, it said.",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the latest rate cut was \"welcome news\", but added: \"There is more to do, and I know families are still facing cost of living pressures.",
      "Mr Bailey said the UK had \"still a lot to do\" on growth: \"We have seen over the last, really since the financial crisis, 15 years or so now, the rates of growth be consistently lower than they were before that.\"",

      "CPI was 2.6% in the year to March 2025, down from 2.8% in the 12 months to February.",
      "It was a bigger drop than analysts had expected, which the ONS said was driven by a fall in clothing and shoe prices.",
      "The Bank also considers other measures such as \"core inflation\" when deciding whether and how to change rates.",

      "This was 3.4% in March, down slightly from 3.5% in February.",
      "Why are prices still rising?",
      "Inflation has fallen significantly since hitting 11.1% in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.",
      "However, that doesn't mean prices are falling - just that they are rising less quickly.",
      "Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "It then remained well above the 2% target partly because of higher food prices.",
      "Why does putting up interest rates help to lower inflation?",
      "When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.",
      "The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.",
      "In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.",
      "But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.",
      "For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.",
      "Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.",

      "However he warned that the introduction of US tariffs has shown \"how unpredictable the global economy can be\". The Bank said it expected the tariffs to slow the UK economy and lead to lower inflation than expected.",

    "summary": "A drop in international student numbers has driven the worsening financial position, a report says.",
    "story": [
      "More than four in 10 universities in England are expecting to be in a financial deficit by this summer, according to new report from the Office for Students (OfS).",
      "The OfS, which regulates higher education providers, said universities were closing courses and selling buildings to cut costs, but \"significant reform and efficiencies\" were needed to turn the tide.",
      "It said a drop in international students coming to the UK was the main reason for the worsening financial position.",
      "Universities UK (UUK) said the report was \"deeply sobering\", while the education secretary said it demonstrated the necessity of raising tuition fees in England.",
      "The report found that 117 of 270 higher education institutions (43%) registered with the OfS expected to be in deficit by the end of July - despite course closures, job losses and selling off assets.",
      "This third consecutive year of worsening finances was mainly driven by a fall in international student numbers, it said, particularly following visa changes in January 2024.",
      "The number of international students was almost 16% lower last year than previously expected, according to the report.",
      "Universities have become increasingly reliant on higher fees from international students in recent years, as tuition fees from UK students have not kept up with inflation.",
      "Their financial plans predict that more than half of the growth in their tuition fee income up to 2028 will come from international students - but the OfS warned that this was optimistic.",
      "Susan Lapworth, chief executive of the OfS, told the BBC it was \"not currently expecting any large or medium institutions to fail over the next 12 months or so\".",
      "She said: \"Many institutions are financially secure or taking sensible steps to ensure that they're financially secure, so I wouldn't want students to be unduly concerned about these issues.\"",
      "But she went on to say that the OfS was working with a small number of institutions that were \"under real pressure\", including ensuring they drew up plans to protect students in the event that they were forced to close.",
      "Ms Lapworth said OfS was \"constantly thinking\" about when students might need to be told about the situation at those institutions, explaining: \"We know that if the regulator says 'we're working with a particular university', the risk is that its financial failure is then precipitated by simply saying that.\"",
      "The OfS has also said that any student going to university this autumn should expect the course to be delivered as advertised.",
      "Why are university tuition fees going up?",
      "Everything you need to know about student loans",
      "University tuition fees rising to \u00a39,535 in England",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the figures were \"concerning\" and demonstrated why raising tuition fees in England from this autumn was necessary.",
      "\"Further reforms are needed to fix the foundations of higher education, and universities must do more to make their finances work,\" she added.",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of UUK, which represents 141 institutions, said the report was \"deeply sobering\" but not surprising given frozen domestic tuition fees, visa changes and \"a longstanding failure of research grants to cover costs\".",
      "She said universities were doing \"everything they can\" to manage costs and that a UUK sector-wide taskforce would \"unlock greater efficiencies\".",
      "But she added: \"The scale of the challenge means none of this will be enough without government on the pitch too.\"",
      "Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said universities were \"under severe financial stress\".",
      "\"Over 10,000 jobs are already set to disappear from the sector as vice-chancellors attempt to bin courses and cut student provision to the bone,\" she said.",
      "She added that university staff would gather in London on Saturday, calling on the government and university leaders to \"protect higher education, one of our last world-leading sectors\".",
      "University cash crisis to get worse despite tuition fee rise, BBC told",
      "Why tuition fees are set to rise - and what this means for students",
      "'My university course made me who I am - now it's being cut'",
      "A recent snapshot of the financial decisions of 60 of the 141 institutions in UUK found that almost half of those responding had closed courses or reduced options for students in the last three years.",
      "Industrial disputes are under way in several cities as a result.",
      "Universities are now anxiously awaiting the government's draft plan for managing immigration,  which is expected to further limit visas for students applying from Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.",
      "Attracting international students who pay higher fees and spend money in the UK is counted as an export.  The rule change in January 2024 prevented postgraduate students from bringing relatives, and has led to a drop in numbers applying.",
      "The higher fees paid by international students have been used to prop up university finances after many years in which tuition fees for students in England have barely increased.",
      "While fees are due to go up this autumn to \u00a39,535 for students in England,  ministers have yet to say what will happen in following years.",
      "The government is carrying out a review of university education, including funding, which is due to report this summer.",

      "Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May.",
      "This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog.",
      "It's a lot to take in.",
      "To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work).",
      "Left-field pop bangers",
      "Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage.",
      "With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through.",
      "Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry \u2013 something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites.",
      "Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels.",
      "Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do.",
      "Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love.",
      "A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown.",
      "A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo.",
      "Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party \u2013 a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there.",
      "Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer.",
      "More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poup\u00e9e Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son.",
      "Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control.",
      "\"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch.",
      "Other countries sucking up to Italy",
      "Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese.",
      "The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino \u2013 the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.",
      "Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda).",
      "Written by Gabry Ponte \u2013 one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) \u2013 it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.",
      "The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks.",
      "More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato.",
      "Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\".",
      "Smut!",
      "I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult.",
      "A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving.",
      "In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" \u2013 the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing.",
      "It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write.",
      "If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.",
      "Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche.",
      "Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you.",
      "With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year.",
      "Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\".",
      "Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff \u2013 and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus.",
      "Three songs inspired by cancer",
      "Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\".",
      "The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating.",
      "This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection.",
      "French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old.",
      "Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself.",
      "She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear.",
      "Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\"",
      "Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\"",
      "Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.",
      "As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt.",
      "\"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World.",
      "Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment.",
      "The bops",
      "Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, \"Nah, we're good, thanks\".",
      "There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave.",
      "\"Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending.\"",
      "A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat.",
      "Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen.",
      "Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished.",
      "Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain.",
      "Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings.",
      "That's less likely for V\u00e6b, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, Ro\u00e1, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".",
      "Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds.",
      "Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame.",
      "And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz \u2013 a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute.",
      "Post-immigrant pop",
      "OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike.",
      "They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkod\u00ebr, to a progressive electronic sound.",
      "Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony \u2013 a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where \"oil would smell like lilac\" (no, me neither).",
      "Greece's entry, Asterom\u00e1ta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland.",
      "\"Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,\" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings.",
      "Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre.",
      "His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation.",
      "Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing.",
      "Witchcraft, sorcery and moody goth boys",
      "The success of \"goth gremlin witch\" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025.",
      "Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja \u2013 summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to \"cleanse\" her of a toxic relationship.",
      "It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes.",
      "What a time to be alive.",
      "Marko Bo\u0161njak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia.",
      "The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days.",
      "His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals.",
      "Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\".",
      "Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though.",
      "Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\".",
      "He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch \u2013 so there's a clue.",
      "Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair.",
      "Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father.",
      "Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\".",
      "Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens.",
      "Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila.",
      "Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals.",
      "70s rock throwbacks",
      "Four years after M\u00e5neskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace.",
      "Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi \u2013 think David Bowie as Pierrot \u2013 and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough).",
      "A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\"",
      "It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once.",
      "Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place).",
      "It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis.",
      "\"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes.",
      "Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia.",
      "Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex \u2013 while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones.",
      "It's better than that makes it sound.",
      "The ballads",
      "Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"?",
      "Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew.",
      "The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.",
      "It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events \u2013 \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year.",
      "That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song \u2013 a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom \u2013 is about \"freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live\".",
      "\"No amount of manufactured hate will change that,\" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs.",
      "Montenegro's Nina \u017di\u017ei\u0107 tackles domestic abuse in Dobrodo\u0161li, a brooding and refined orchestral ballad.",
      "The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off.",
      "Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zo\u00eb M\u00eb, who describes herself as a \"little fairy\".",
      "Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings,   fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness.",
      "Automatically qualifying for the final, it's a welcome oasis of calm amidst the steamy sauna sessions, moody goth haircuts and thrusting innuendo.",

      "\"Lights, camera\u2026 tariff?\" - that's the question a scrambling movie industry has been asking this week after an unexpected intervention from US President Donald Trump.",
      "Writing on his Truth Social platform last Sunday, Trump announced plans to hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he attempts to stop Hollywood dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "His threat comes as studios increasingly shift productions abroad to places such as the UK.",
      "The White House has since clarified that \"no final decision\" has been made and that they're \"exploring all options\" for revitalising the US film industry.",
      "But Trump's suggestion alone has sent shockwaves through the industry - from Hollywood to Hertfordshire - so what might all of this mean in practice?",
      "In 2014, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was shot by Disney at Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire, and Hollywood has kept growing closer to the UK since.",
      "Last year alone, the British Film Institute says 65% of UK production spend came from the five major US film studios and three US streaming giants - Netflix, Apple and Amazon. This amounted to \u00a31.37bn ($1.71bn), a near 50% jump on 2023.",
      "In Hollywood, by contrast, film and television production in Los Angeles has dropped by nearly 40% over the past decade.",
      "The reason? Well largely, it's cheaper to make films in the UK. That's thanks to generous tax incentives such as the Film Tax Relief, which offers a 25% tax rebate - as well as lower labour costs and centralised national funding for film.",
      "As British actor Brian Cox told Times Radio on Tuesday: \"The reality is films go where they can afford.\"",
      "For Universal's blockbuster Jurassic World: Dominion, these incentives delivered a reported \u00a389.1m ($111.38m) in savings.",
      "In the US, tax incentives operate on a state level - and Hollywood has relatively poor tax breaks - not only compared with the UK, which can offer 10% more, but other states such as New York and Georgia, too.",
      "Fixing that is no easy task. Trump has appointed Golden Globe Award-winning actor Jon Voight, 86, as a special ambassador to Hollywood, and met with him a day before dropping his light-on-detail proposal.",
      "But it's not exactly clear how tariffs would solve the internal tax problem in the US. A possible solution, raised by Voight, is a federal tax incentive to mirror the UK.",
      "The Wrap's film reporter Jeremy Fuster tells the BBC it is \"unlikely\", in the current highly-charged climate, that Republicans would \"support a federal tax incentive that can easily be portrayed as a handout to 'woke Hollywood'\".",
      "And what would the impact be on moviegoers if the levy goes ahead?",
      "Fuster says costs, like any other tariffed good, would be passed onto audiences through ticket prices, premium on-demand increases or subscription rates.",
      "How exactly this would take form is \"something nobody knows\".",
      "It's not all about the money, because while a boost to US production could benefit parts of the industry, some projects will still need to shoot abroad. \"Amazon isn't going to make the next James Bond entirely in America,\" Fuster notes.",
      "Culture minister Sir Chris Bryant has said the UK government is in \"active discussions with the top of the US administration\" on the \"very fluid\" situation.",

    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 08:12:02 GMT",
    "summary": "The Doctor will be transported to Lagos in the first ever episode set primarily in an African country.",
    "story": [
      "\"Whatever I was doing - maybe cleaning up or doing homework - when I heard the 'oooh-oooh-oooooh',\" Adesoji Kukoyi says, mimicking the iconic Doctor Who theme tune, \"I dropped everything and ran straight to the television.\"",
      "As a child growing up in 1980s Nigeria, Mr Kukoyi was infatuated with sci-fi sensation Doctor Who. British shows like Allo Allo and Fawlty Towers aired regularly as a cultural hangover from the colonial era, but none captured Mr Kukoyi's imagination like the time-travelling Doctor did.",
      "\"He always spoke to me,\" 44-year-old Mr Kukoyi, who currently has a vintage Doctor Who theme as the ringtone on his phone, tells the BBC.",
      "\"Like there's somebody watching out for us... yes, we make mistakes, but we do our best, especially if we have a teacher that will lead us on the right path.\"",
      "Mr Kukoyi has been watching Doctor Who for decades, so when he heard that on Saturday an episode will, for the very first time, be set in Nigeria, he was elated.",
      "\"I was watching last week's episode with my wife and the preview [for the following week] said: 'Welcome to Lagos, Nigeria'. I screamed like a little girl!\" Mr Kukoyi says.",
      "The setting is momentous not just for Mr Kukoyi - a native of Nigeria's biggest and liveliest city Lagos - but for the show too. Saturday's adventure will be the first primarily set in Africa.",
      "It is fitting that the producers chose Nigeria for this milestone - in 2013, fans worldwide were delighted when nine lost Doctor Who episodes from the 1960s were unearthed in a Nigerian TV facility.",
      "Ariyon Bakare, who in the upcoming episode plays the mysterious Barber, says fans can expect \"a time-bending cultural ancestral collision\" and \"hair, lots of hair\".",
      "The preview also teases a vibrant barber shop, a brimming Lagos market and a towering, monstrous-looking spider.",
      "Fans speculate that this creature is Anansi, a legendary character in West African and Caribbean folktales, but scriptwriter Inua Ellams is keeping specifics under wraps.",
      "As for why the show has enjoyed such popularity in Nigeria, he says: \"There's something Nigerian about the Doctor. Nigerians are sort of loud, gregarious people... the Doctor is mysterious, boisterous, sort of over-confident but somehow manages to save the day.\"",
      "Ellams, who moved from Nigeria to the UK as a child, also considers why in 62 years, a character known to traverse the universe has barely spent any time in Africa.",
      "It could be that no writer has felt confident enough to produce an authentic African story, he says, or it might be down to the Doctor's need to \"blend into his environment and be inconspicuous\".",
      "\"Ncuti Gatwa [who plays the Doctor] being an actor of African descent means that we can tell new stories with the Doctor and negotiate in different spaces because of his appearance.",
      "\"And this is the brilliance of the show - every Doctor creates new opportunities to tell new stories in different ways,\" Ellams tells the BBC.",
      "But these fresh Doctor Who stories have a smaller reach than the old ones did, as the show is no longer broadcast on Nigerian public TV. If you are in the country and want to catch up on the Doctor's exploits, you would have to subscribe to streaming service Disney Plus.",
      "Regardless, Mr Kukoyi insists that a dedicated troop of Nigerian Doctor Who lovers will be sitting transfixed on their sofas on Saturday evening, bearing witness to the Tardis materialising in Lagos.",
      "\"I'm waiting with baited breath,\" he says. \"Finally, he is coming!\"",
      "Mr Kukoyi - whose first experience of the Doctor was one played by a stripy scarf-wearing Tom Baker - says his young daughters are not so taken with his beloved show.",
      "He is \"trying to get them onboard\", he says.",
      "Perhaps seeing the Doctor wearing traditional Nigerian clothing, squeezing his way through a quintessential Lagos market and getting caught up in local folklore will help them fall in love with the show the way their father once did.",

    "summary": "The Lockerbie bombing's impact and lessons learned are explored in TV drama The Bombing of Pan Am 103.",
    "story": [
      "Richard Monetti was aged just 20 when he was flying home to New York from London for the Christmas holidays, after studying abroad as one of 35 students from Syracuse University.",
      "But he and everyone else on the plane never made it home.",
      "They lost their lives in the UK's most deadly terror atrocity, when a bomb in the hold of their flight, Pan Am 103, exploded above the Scottish town of Lockerbie.",
      "It killed 270 people from 21 countries, including 11 people on the ground, and this devastating event has now been dramatised in an upcoming BBC drama series, The Bombing of Pan Am 103.",
      "Kara Weipz still recalls how she and her family found out her brother Richard was among the dead - they heard it for the first time on a news report about the bombing.",
      "As well as adding to their trauma, she says it also highlighted faults in the response system for victims' families.",
      "\"I think it was very important to make sure those lessons were learned - like families had to be notified before names could be released,\" she tells BBC News.",
      "\"We didn't have that luxury in 1988, when names were released before we were notified. So that's something that came out of it, and changed as a result.\"",
      "As president of the Victims of Pan Am Flight 103 group, a role she took on from her father Bob Monetti, she says it's crucial that relatives \"know what rights they have\", while stressing the group's role in \"educating those who deal with victims\".",
      "Those lessons went on to improve how victims' families were treated in the aftermath of 9/11, when four planes flying over the eastern US were seized simultaneously by hijackers, killing 2,977 people.",
      "Screenwriter Gillian Roger Park, who was born just a couple of days before the Lockerbie bombing and grew up not far from the Scottish town, is a co-writer on the series.",
      "It dramatises the Scots-US investigation into the attack, the effect it had on victims' families and how it impacted Lockerbie's locals.",
      "Roger Park says the families \"made history\", by speaking out about flaws in the system.",
      "\"After their lobbying and campaigning, a lot of the protocols introduced in the aftermath of 9/11 were based on what they campaigned for,\" she says.",
      "Airlines also benefited from their experiences.",
      "\"A lot of Pan Am 103 family members trained airlines on how to deal with victims,\" she adds.",
      "Kathryn Turman, played in the series by Severance actress Merritt Wever, was head of the Office for Victims of Crime, for the US Department of Justice.",
      "Turman arranged travel for family members plus secure closed-circuit viewing in the US, for the trial of two bombing suspects in the Netherlands, in 2000. The FBI notes this was unprecedented at the time.",
      "Weipz adds: \"We have victim services in the FBI, in the Department of Justice, in the US Attorney's office. Why? Well, because of Kathryn, but also because of the Pan Am 103 families.\"",
      "Turman's character poignantly says in one of the episodes: \"The families should have been protected and prioritised from the start... we can't make that mistake again.\"",
      "The drama also highlights that lobbying by UK and US-based family groups resulted in \"key reforms, from strengthening travel warning systems and tighter baggage screening, to people-centred responses to major disasters\".",
      "For the series' lead writer Jonathan Lee, creating a factual drama 37 years later was also a way of exploring the human stories behind the horror.",
      "A co-production with Netflix, the show shines a light on \"the story of these small, but heroic acts of connective humanity, in the wake of this bomb that tried to blast things apart\", he says.",
      "For such a dark topic, it has some surprisingly uplifting moments.",
      "We witness the strength of bonds forged between people, in the wake of the bombing.",
      "\"Collaboration between families, countries and law enforcement agencies gets us from the worst of humanity to the best of it\", former lawyer Lee tells the BBC.",
      "\"We piece things together by working together.\"",
      "The series is something of a jigsaw - we see the police and FBI painstakingly process thousands of fragments of evidence, in the build-up to Abdulbaset Al Megrahi being convicted over the bombing in 2001.",
      "Two years later, Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi accepted his country's responsibility for the bombing, and paid compensation to the victims' families.",
      "The other pieces in the TV drama's puzzle focus on the lives of the people of Lockerbie and beyond, with volunteers stepping up to help traumatised families.",
      "Weipz recalled one scene in the drama, where her father tries to reach a financial settlement for his son's death with the Pan Am insurance panel.",
      "\"That was one of the worst days of my life... hearing your brother really had no value because he was 20 years old, and was an assistant manager at a swim club and mowed lawns...",
      "\"Watching it, you see how horrifying it was.\"",
      "We also see women from Lockerbie, who made endless cakes for the investigators, washed victims' clothes before they were returned to families and showed relatives the spot where their loved ones died.",
      "\"It was important to flesh out those emotional, human stories, to bring the Scottish stories to life,\" says Roger Park about the volunteers.",
      "\"They did such hard work and it wasn't their jobs, they were just locals who felt a moral obligation to help.",
      "\"Those women are just like my gran, I know those types of women, and I just think we rarely centre on those kinds of domestic stories.",
      "\"And what strong stuff you'd have to be made of to do what they did. I just love that they used the tools of their domestic lives to do such heroic work.\"",
      "New York-based Michelle Lipkin, whose father Frank Ciulla was killed on the flight, speaks fondly about \"the women who laundered the clothes\", including Ella Ramsden and Moira Shearer.",
      "\"My mother was close to Ella and Moira, and we see Moira when we go to Scotland,\" she says.",
      "\"There's no words to describe the gratitude we have for them, because our loved ones were murdered.",
      "\"It's the most evil of evil, and so every piece of clothing they laundered, every meal they made for the searchers - that just brought back what is possible, and the human spirit and kindness.\"",
      "Weipz also speaks about the \"compassion\" shown by the people of Lockerbie in the hours after the bombing.",
      "\"People slept outside with the bodies too. They didn't want them to be alone. It just overwhelms me at the times when I think about it,\" she says.",
      "Scottish actress Lauren Lyle plays June, the wife of Det Sgt Ed McCusker, one of the lead Scottish police officers.",
      "She says although the investigation was a \"male-heavy story because it was the 80s\", she also thinks \"the women just stepped right up\", often behind the scenes.",
      "Lyle spoke to the real-life Ed McCusker to research her role, and says: \"About five years ago, June got cancer, and she knew she was going to die. And she said to Eddie, 'One thing I want you to do is make sure you tell this story'.",
      "\"She sounded like a really formidable woman who held the family together, and I think she represents the people of Lockerbie.\"",
      "Weipz adds: \"Maybe people watching this will take some of the compassion they see, and pay it forward - we need some more of that in the world these days.\"",

      "\"I'm pretty sure we hung out in Brixton. Hopefully I didn't embarrass myself.\"",
      "Luke Pritchard, the eternally youthful lead singer of The Kooks, is reintroducing himself to fellow indie survivor and Hard-Fi frontman, Richard Archer.",
      "Both admit the 2000s, when they each sold millions of records, are a bit of a blur.",
      "\"But I think I'd remember if you'd done something odd,\" reassures Archer, all chiselled good looks and friendly bonhomie.",
      "\"It's weird, because we were all part of the same scene but, when you're on tour, everyone's like planets, orbiting around but missing each other.\"",
      "The Kooks and The 'Fi were at the epicentre of the last great indie boom \u2013 a scene that kicked off in 2002 when The Libertines jolted British guitar music out of its post-Britpop slump.",
      "Over the next half-decade, they joined acts like Franz Ferdinand, Kaiser Chiefs and Razorlight as they surfed a wave to the top of the charts.",
      "Angular riffs, clever-clever lyrics and big, hooky choruses were the order of the day.",
      "By 2006, seven of the UK's 10 best-selling new albums were by guitar bands, including the Arctic Monkeys' incendiary debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and The Kooks' Inside In/Inside Out.",
      "But the party couldn't last forever.",
      "In 2008, The Word magazine coined the phrase \"indie landfill\" to describe a seemingly endless parade of identikit bloke-bands cluttering the airwaves.",
      "Where were they all coming from? Why couldn't you tell them apart? Why where they all called \"The Something\"?",
      "Almost overnight, radio stations ditched indie for a new generation of forward-thinking pop (Lady Gaga, Florence + The Machine) and club-centric hip-hop (Black Eyed Peas, Dizzee Rascal).",
      "\"It did suddenly seem that four boys in a band became very un-hip,\" says Archer.",
      "\"The opportunities dried up in England,\" agrees Pritchard. \"We were playing smaller venues and the vibe just wasn't exciting any more.\"",
      "\"It got to a point where we were just exhausted,\" Archer continues. \"It felt like we were screaming into the void. So we stopped and tried other things.\"",
      "In the 2010s, Hard-Fi's guitarist Ross Phillips retrained as a tiler, while Archer formed the short-lived blues band OffWorld.",
      "But when he streamed an acoustic set of Hard-Fi songs during Covid, the response was big enough to tempt the band back on stage. A one-off gig at London's Forum sold out in minutes.",
      "\"The response was just so warm. I was quite taken aback by it,\" says Archer.",
      "The show led to a full reunion. This summer, the band will release a 20th anniversary edition of their class-conscious, Mercury Prize-nominated debut, Stars of CCTV, while preparing a long-delayed fourth album.",
      "The Kooks, meanwhile, never went away, recording a clutch of more experimental albums that blended drum loops, pastoral pop and even Ethiopian jazz influences.",
      "But today, the band are bigger than ever after hits like Na\u00efve and Ooh La found a new audience on TikTok.",
      "Later this year, they will headline the O2 Arena for the first time, with18 to 24-year-olds making up 45% of the audience.",
      "How do they explain this sudden revival?",
      "\"We're at that point where teenagers start going back to listen to the music their parents grew up with,\" Pritchard observes.",
      "\"In the 90s, we did it too, going back and discovering Nick Drake, so there's a circular nature to it. The scene, and even the fashion, has come around again.\"",
      "But there's something else, too. Songs like The Kooks' She Moves In Her Own Way and Hard-Fi's Hard To Beat have something that went missing in the 2010s - choruses you can sing until you're hoarse.",
      "\"Yeah, that anthemic thing was removed from guitar music,\" agrees Pritchard. \"People started consuming music on earbuds, so they connected with the introspective stuff.",
      "\"But when we were gathering a little fanbase in Brighton, we'd play all these small clubs and you'd filter the setlist by whether people could sing along to the hook.\"",
      "Archer recalls the grind of those early tours. In their first year, he reckons, Hard-Fi were on the road for \"almost 365 days\".",
      "But with one grassroots venue closing every fortnight in the UK, it's getting harder to book tours and road-test songs.",
      "\"What worries me is, if you're a new artist now, do you have the opportunity to go out there and make mistakes and fix them?\" says Archer.",
      "A shrinking live scene isn't the only upheaval in the industry.",
      "The Kooks' debut album sold 1.5 million copies in 2006 \u2013 making it the fifth biggest record of the year. Compare that with 2024, when the best-selling album in the UK (Taylor Swift's Tortured Poets Department) only sold 600,000 copies.",
      "Streams have cannibalised sales, turning every artist into a cult act. It doesn't help that opportunities for promoting music have dried up.",
      "The only music TV show left standing is Later... With Jools Holland, while weekly music magazines like the NME are no more - not that everyone laments its demise.",
      "\"We were never the best friends with the NME,\" laughs Archer.",
      "\"Who was?\" asks Pritchard. \"There were two or three anointed bands and the rest of us were cast out.\"",
      "Are there any reviews seared into their memories?",
      "\"No, I've done a lot of work on that,\" Pritchard jokes. \"But I definitely was more sensitive than I should have been.\"",
      "\"How can you not be, though?\" asks Archer. \"They're criticising something you've sweated blood and tears over.\"",
      "While compiling the anniversary edition of Stars of CCTV, he found an old clipping where a critic said the band's fans didn't understand real music.",
      "\"I kept it,\" he says, \"so I could get revenge later.\"",
      "\"You should frame it and put it in the loo,\" Pritchard suggests.",
      "\"Then I'd just be angry every time I have a dump.\"",
      "But the music press was powerful in the 2000s. Both frontmen recall feeling pressure to live up to the NME's ideal of a gobby frontman.",
      "Archer, a thoughtful and introspective character, was even provoked into saying he wanted to be the biggest star in the world.",
      "\"I don't see the point in being just another indie band,\" he boasted in one interview. \"What's the point of being parochial and small-time? I'm in competition with Eminem.\"",
      "\"You had to be super-confident and say provocative things,\" Pritchard reflects now.",
      "\"But what I learned is that a lot of songwriters are introspective, insular people - and when you throw them in front of a camera, it's quite challenging.\"",

    "summary": "The Tomb Raider star will appear in a new West End production of Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea.",
    "story": [
      "There's a strong chance you will have seen Alicia Vikander on screen in the past decade, thanks to performances in films such as Tomb Raider, Ex Machina and her Oscar-winning role in The Danish Girl.",
      "One place you won't have seen her during that time, however, is on stage.",
      "The Swedish actress hasn't appeared in the theatre for 17 years, when she was a teenager. But that's about to change.",
      "Vikander will star in a new West End production of Ibsen's The Lady from the Sea, which will also be her UK theatre debut.",
      "Speaking to BBC News, Vikander, 36, said she was \"thrilled\" to be returning to the stage, but added it was a \"daunting thing to do... it's my first time on stage as an adult\".",
      "The production will play at London's Bridge Theatre for eight weeks from 10 September, organisers announced on Wednesday.",
      "\"I grew up being at the theatre a lot, my mother [Maria Fahl] was a stage actress, and I think even when I was dreaming of becoming an actress myself, being on stage was the journey that I kind of visualised,\" Vikander said.",
      "\"Back in Sweden, where I'm from, if you're an actor then really what you are is on stage. And you're lucky to maybe have a TV show or film every couple of years, because that's how small the industry is in Sweden.",
      "\"So I think that's what I always saw in front of me. And then life happened, and throughout the years [theatre] has always been something I've been waiting for and thinking 'it will happen'.\"",
      "The play has been adapted and directed by Simon Stone, and will also star The Walking Dead's Andrew Lincoln.",
      "Vikander will play lead character Ellida, the sea-loving daughter of a lighthouse-keeper.",
      "Ellida is married to a Norwegian doctor, but when a sailor she used to be engaged to suddenly returns, she is forced to choose between her current and former lover.",
      "The play marks the introduction of the character Hilde Wangel, one of the doctor's daughters from a previous marriage.",
      "Hilde goes on to appear in one of Ibsen's later plays, The Master Builder, a new adaptation of which is coincidentally also currently in the West End, starring Ewan McGregor.",
      "An adaptation of another Ibsen play, Enemy of the People, opened in London last year starring Doctor Who actor Matt Smith.",
      "'Perfect match'",
      "Director Stone has previously helmed films such as The Dig and The Daughter, while his extensive theatre credits include productions of Yerma, Phaedra, Medea and Angels in America.",
      "\"He once again is going to take a classic and reinvent it and make it be something that is relatable to our modern audience today,\" Vikander said.",
      "\"And when I was told he was doing Ibsen and The Lady from the Sea, I guess that going back to my Scandinavian and Swedish heritage, it kind of felt like a perfect match.\"",
      "Vikander said she felt the reason many of the classics are still being performed in the West End is they tackle many of the same subjects society still grapples with today.",
      "\"I have discussions with my friends, I just passed 35, I'm getting close to my 40s soon and I have my kids, but I still feel extremely young. Really young. Sometimes I'm like, 'I'm 25 still!'",
      "\"But then I also realise I'm entering this very new chapter which is really exciting, but I think if you are in a place where you feel like you haven't fulfilled certain dreams or tried things, you're still wondering where these choices or action would have led you, then I think it's extremely human thing.",
      "\"Women throughout history have been held back, maybe because they didn't have the same opportunities, or they financially couldn't do some things, or ended up in situations where it was harder to break away from the role of being a mother.",
      "\"So therefore when I read it, I feel like I totally understand the turmoil this woman goes through, and I don't think humans have changed that much from a core, emotional point of view. And I think that's why we're interested in these stories.\"",
      "She added: \"It's incredible that the big universal questions are something we're still battling in the same way.\"",
      "Vikander said she was \"super excited and wonderfully nervous\" to begin the workshopping process with Stone in the coming weeks, out of which he will begin to produce the final script.",
      "As the show is still being developed, it has not yet been confirmed what the setting will be for this production.",
      "Another UK adaptation of The Lady from the Sea performed in 2017 at the Donmar Theatre moved the story to the Caribbean in the 1950s.",
      "The new adaptation is billed as her UK stage debut, but Vikander notes it's actually her first theatre of any kind since she was 19.",
      "\"I did theatre for my teens for a lot of years, like a child actor, and then the last thing I did was when I was a dancer for the Stockholm Opera House,\" she explained.",
      "\"I grew up watching my mother doing theatre, and I 'd always watch from afar, and I can't wait to try and do it myself.",
      "\"It's a daunting thing to do, obviously, it's my first time on stage as an adult, and it's on the London stage, and obviously I want to make sure people get their ticket money's worth! But I'm really excited.\""

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkg403x1gxo",
    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 11:14:19 GMT",
    "summary": "The Bafta award-winning film gives viewers a window into a \"highly secret and a deeply private process\".",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 film Conclave - a box office hit and Oscar winner - tells the story of a papal election in which there are no obvious favourites. For many people, it was a glimpse into the rarefied world of the Vatican, and the highly secretive process of choosing a leader for the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "On Wednesday, life followed fiction when 133 cardinals began the process of electing a successor to Pope Francis. As viewers of the film will know, the papal conclave takes place entirely behind the closed doors of the Sistine Chapel, beneath its world-famous Michelangelo frescoes.",
      "Nobody outside the confines of the Vatican knew the outcome until a plume of white smoke curled from its chimney on Thursday, signifying that the Roman Catholic Church had a new leader. That man was Cardinal Robert Prevost, now known as Pope Leo XIV.",
      "But what does the film tell us about how the conclave operates, and why do people find the process so fascinating?",
      "'Intense responsibility'",
      "Adapted from the bestselling novel by Robert Harris, Conclave shows the cardinal-electors isolating themselves within the confines of the Vatican during the process of the election.",
      "They are not allowed communication with anyone outside the conclave -  although given the practicalities, they are not entirely cut off.",
      "\"They all need feeding, they're not totally hermetically sealed off from the world,\" says Stephen Bullivant, professor of theology and the sociology of religion at St Mary's University, Twickenham.",
      "This self-imposed isolation is a tradition which stretches back hundreds of years.",
      "In part, it is aimed at preventing the electors from being influenced by external factors, although the idea of a process that happens behind closed doors may seem at odds with the modern world's \"focus on transparency, visibility and scrutiny\", according to Anna Rowlands, professor of Catholic social thought and practice at the University of Durham.",
      "The film invokes an \"incredible, introspective atmosphere\" and sense of withdrawal from the world, she says. \"I struggle to think of a more intense responsibility and feeling than being locked away in conclave.\"",
      "What is behind the new Pope's chosen name, Leo?",
      "Who is Robert Prevost, the new Pope Leo XIV?",
      "Pope Leo XIV marks new beginning for Catholic Church",
      "What Pope's speedy election says about Church's priorities",
      "'Lots of politicking'",
      "On the screen, claustrophobic and intense deliberations, strategic huddles and tactical moves abound. One cardinal undermines a frontrunner to improve their own chances. Others with unlikely prospects urge their supporters to change their vote.",
      "This conflict of interests and competing ideologies provides much of the film's drama. \"It's essentially about the political machinations that go on,\" Nick Emerson, the film's editor, told the BBC earlier this year.",
      "While some cardinals will think the most important part is following divine guidance, others will have anxiety over making a quick decision, says Tina Beattie, professor emerita of Catholic studies at the University of Roehampton.",
      "Given that Pope Francis's health had been poor for a while, it is likely that, even before the conclave, \"there will have been lots of politicking and jostling for position already behind the scenes\", she adds.",
      "\"There will be all those tussles going on and [the cardinals] won't all be of one mind.\"",
      "Although in the film, some of the tensest scenes are focused on the act of voting, in reality, much of the drama may come in meetings in the days before conclave officially begins.",
      "During this time, the participants would have been \"getting to know each other, working out what the priorities are and learning how to work together as a body so they can come up with a unified decision\", says Prof Rowlands, who is nearing the end of a two-year secondment to the Vatican.",
      "A complete unknown?",
      "In the film, an unknown cardinal - secretly appointed by the late pope - is catapulted into the fray.",
      "In real life, this would not be possible. Although any baptised Roman Catholic male is theoretically eligible to be made pope, all cardinals voting in the conclave would need to have been appointed publicly by a previous pope.",
      "Having said this, the most recent election was one of the most unpredictable there has ever been. About 80% of the cardinals eligible to vote had been appointed in the past 12 years by Pope Francis. He consciously chose people from across the globe and with diverse political backgrounds.",
      "Many of Francis' appointees are from the developing world - \"places and contexts which are not normally given a red hat\", says Prof Rowlands.",
      "This added a level of uncertainty as to their priorities and the ultimate decision of who would succeed Pope Francis.",
      "'A very human thing'",
      "The film presents the cardinals as fallible human beings jostling for power.",
      "Director Edward Berger told the BBC last year that while the conclave was thought of as \"an ancient spiritual ritual\", he wanted to bring the participants \"into modernity\".",
      "\"We put them on this pedestal, and when you look closer, they're going to have cell phones, they're going to smoke, they have the same problems and vices and secrets as we do.\"",
      "Prof Rowlands says the film provides a peek behind a process, with all elements of human nature and human life in it: \"Loss. grief, ambition, fear, temptation, courage.\"",
      "She adds: \"It's a very, very human thing, a conclave... It's got a divine purpose to it, but it's a very human thing.\"",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has said he will hit movies made in foreign countries with 100% tariffs, as he ramps up trade disputes with nations around the world.",
      "Trump said in a post on Truth Social that he was authorising the US Department of Commerce and Trade Representative to start the process to impose the levy because America's movie industry was dying \"a very fast death\".",
      "He later said he would consult Hollywood executives to see if \"they're happy\" with his proposal, after the news sent shockwaves through the industry.",
      "So what might this mean for both the US film industry and the global movie business, including the UK?",
      "Is Hollywood 'dying'?",
      "Announcing the new tariffs, Trump declared that Hollywood was \"dying\". So is it?",
      "It's true that the industry has been through a really rough time in recent years.",
      "The pandemic saw production close down and the impact is ongoing.",
      "Hollywood studios spent $11.3 billion on productions in the second quarter of 2024, a 20% drop from the same period in 2022, as studios continued to cut costs in an attempt to recover from Covid losses.",
      "Any shoots of recovery were then severely stifled by the 2023 actors and writers strikes.",
      "Then the wildfires struck earlier this year.",
      "And for several years now, more and more people - not just youngsters - have been turning to YouTube and other streaming platforms for content.",
      "The US remains a major film production hub and according to Variety, 2025 has seen a rebound in box office numbers since last year, with overall domestic revenues up 15.8% on 2024 so far.",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "Is YouTube making Hollywood irrelevant?",
      "The latest Marvel superhero film, Thunderbolts*, topped the North American box office this weekend, raking in an estimated $76 million, marking a promising start to the summer season.",
      "But Hollywood is definitely still up against it.",
      "What is Trump proposing?",
      "The president says he wants to \"immediately begin the process of instituting a 100% tariff on any and all movies coming into our country that are produced in foreign lands. We want movies made in America again!\"",
      "This has led to questions about whether the tariffs would also apply to American film companies producing films abroad.",
      "Several recent major movies produced by US studios were shot outside America, including Deadpool & Wolverine, Wicked and Gladiator II. Hit franchises like Mission Impossible also shoot overseas.",
      "We also don't yet know if the tariffs will be applied retrospectively.",
      "Trump later told reporters that \"other nations have been stealing the movies and movie-making capabilities from the United States\", which may suggest he was only referring to non-US films.",
      "White House spokesman Kush Desai told the BBC that \"no final decisions on foreign film tariffs have been made\", and added that the administration is \"exploring all options\".",
      "We will have to wait for more detail.",
      "What incentives do other countries offer?",
      "Many countries offer tax breaks to encourage film production such as New Zealand, Australia and the UK and that's something Trump wants to take on.",
      "But it's not the only reason a US film company might wish to film abroad.",
      "Some choose to do so for the specific location, exotic and exciting backdrops for example. Who could forget Tom Cruise's ascent of the Burj Khalifa, Dubai, in Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol?",
      "What could it mean for the next James Bond movie, a franchise now owned by US giant Amazon, but based on an iconic British character who works for MI6, based in London?",
      "And it's not just other countries that offer incentives - other US states are luring film production away from Hollywood.",
      "Georgia, Illinois and Kentucky are among the many other US states which California are now competing with.",
      "Gavin Newsom, California's governor, who Trump described as \"grossly incompetent\" when speaking about the movie tariffs on Monday, is currently pushing for his plan to more than double the state's film and TV tax incentives to $750 million annually.",
      "While Newsom has made no comment yet on Trump's proposal, his senior communications advisor told Deadline: \"We believe he has no authority to impose tariffs under the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, since tariffs are not listed as a remedy under that law.\"",
      "How would any such tariffs actually work?",
      "There are more questions than answers at this stage.",
      "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has a moratorium on tariffs for digital goods until 2026. Presumably films count as digital goods.",
      "And what would they base the tariffs on? Box office revenue or production costs? Is streaming content included? That would have a huge impact on US companies like Netflix. What about post-production ie editing?",
      "Tim Richards, Vue Entertainment CEO and founder, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"A big part of this is what constitutes US film - is it where the money comes from, the script, the director, the talent, where it was shot?\"",
      "And how do you even classify a foreign film when so many are co-productions and are often shot in several countries?",
      "Trump appeared to be talking about film and not TV but it's not 100% clear at this stage. Would tariffs apply to films made for streaming or just cinema releases? We'll have to wait for more detail. And of course, Trump may rollback on the proposals as he has done with some other tariffs.",
      "What could it mean for other countries?",
      "Obviously, putting a 100% tariff on foreign films means a huge cost increase for those production companies who want to sell to the US market.",
      "Commenting on Trump's announcement, the UK government's Culture Media and Sport Committee chair Dame Caroline Dinenage MP said: \"Last month the Culture, Media and Sport Committee warned against complacency on our status as the Hollywood of Europe. President Trump's announcement has made that warning all too real.",
      "\"Making it more difficult to make films in the UK is not in the interests of American businesses. Their investment in facilities and talent in the UK, based on US-owned IP, is showing fantastic returns on both sides of the Atlantic. Ministers must urgently prioritise this as part of the trade negotiations currently under way.\"",
      "Head of media and entertainment trade union Bectu in the UK, Philippa Childs, said in a statement: \"These tariffs, coming after Covid and the recent slowdown, could deal a knock-out blow to an industry that is only just recovering and will be really worrying news for tens of thousands of skilled freelancers who make films in the UK.\"",
      "Kirsty Bell, chief executive of production company Goldfinch, questioned how the tariffs would work, pointing out that blockbusters like Barbie, which was distributed by US film studio Warner Bros Pictures, \"was actually shot virtually entirely in the UK\".",
      "\"If those US films don't get partly produced or produced in the UK, freelancers are going to be jobless. I'm telling you now, they really are going to be jobless,\" she told PA.",
      "The governments of Australia and New Zealand have also spoken out in support of their countries' film industries.",
      "\"Nobody should be under any doubt that we will be standing up unequivocally for the rights of the Australian screen industry,\" Australia's home affairs minister Tony Burke said.",
      "New Zealand's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon told a news conference that his government was awaiting further details of the proposed tariffs.",
      "\"But we'll be obviously a great advocate, great champion of that sector and that industry,\" he added.",
      "And with the Cannes film festival just around the corner, uncertainty hangs in the air with many US film producers looking to sell foreign distribution rights.",
      "Could such tariffs work?",
      "Tariffs could incentivise US film companies to make more films on home soil but the risk is that if it's more expensive than to do so abroad, some films just won't get made.",
      "More incentives or rebates could help offset this but we just don't know at this stage if that's under discussion on a national scale.",
      "NPR Radio film critic Eric Deggans warned that the tariffs, should they be introduced, could further harm the industry.",
      "Other countries may respond by placing tariffs on American films, he told the BBC, making it \"harder for these films to make profits overseas\".",

    "summary": "After pushing the much-anticipated sequel into 2026, developer Rockstar gives fans a new glimpse of the game.",
    "story": [
      "Just when you'd come to terms with the fact that Grand Theft Auto 6 had been delayed until next year, Rockstar Games goes and drops a brand new trailer.",
      "Last week, the video game developer announced the game had been pushed back to May 2026, shocking fans who were expecting it to land this autumn.",
      "It's been 12 years since the last GTA game was released, and the long wait for the most anticipated sequel of all time just became even more agonising.",
      "But earlier, the company released a new, three-minute trailer, giving eager players a stack of new information to dissect in the meantime.",
      "Here are some of the highlights.",
      "The record-breaking first trailer for GTA 6, published online in late 2023, introduced players to protagonists Jason and Lucia -  a couple who live a life of crime in Leonida, the fictional US state where the game is set.",
      "We now know a bit more about their backstory.",
      "The new trailer opens with Jason doing odd jobs before driving around Vice City - the Miami-inspired location from the 2002 PlayStation 2 game.",
      "According to Rockstar, Jason was a troubled teen who joined the army to escape his bad influences, but fell back into crime after returning home.",
      "In the trailer he eventually collects Lucia from prison, where she has been serving time for \"protecting her family\".",
      "From there, the clip launches into a montage of action sequences, romantic scenes and glimpses of the game's wider world.",
      "We see the couple carrying out armed heists, partying on a yacht and riding a jetski together.",
      "According to a description on Rockstar's website, the two want to forge a new life together but are plunged into \"the middle of a conspiracy\" after an \"easy score goes wrong\".",
      "New characters revealed",
      "Players also got to put names to faces of some of game's wider cast, including bank robber Raul Bautista, smuggler Brian Heder and rap combo Real Dimez.",
      "Like GTA 5, which was heavily based on Los Angeles and its surrounding areas, the sequel also appears to contain accurate recreations of some of Florida's most famous landmarks.",
      "Vice City's version of Miami's art deco, neon-lit beachfront appears in the trailer, as does the Grassrivers swampland, inspired by the Florida everglades.",
      "Rockstar also revealed the Leonida Keys, the industrial Ambrosia region, sleazy Port Gellhorn and the mountainous Kalaga National Park.",
      "In each case, it suggested the areas would be home to different groups and factions, from \"hillbilly mystics\" to biker gangs.",
      "The trailer did not appear to include any gameplay footage, but was made up of cinematic sequences usually seen between story missions.",
      "But fans were quick to praise the game's next-generation graphics in the trailer and a series of screenshots published by Rockstar.",
      "Video game trailers are sometimes created using powerful PCs but a note at the end of the trailer said the scenes in it were taken from a PlayStation 5 console.",
      "But that doesn't answer questions about new ways of interacting with the game's world, or whether players can switch between characters on-the-fly as they could in GTA 5.",
      "Why has GTA 6 taken so long?",
      "The hype around GTA 6 is huge, and Rockstar has form for delaying its games and a reputation for perfectionism.",
      "When it announced the delay last week it told fans it needed extra time to \"deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve\".",
      "According to Bloomberg journalist Jason Schreier, the delay was to also to avoid \"crunch\" - a gaming industry term for enforced overtime.",
      "The company was previously criticised by some staff over the practice - it accepted that some worked \"long hours\" but said some accounts were exaggerated.",
      "When GTA 6's delay was announced, shares in Rockstar's parent company, Take Two Interactive, dropped by 10%.",
      "The industry was banking on the game - which will initially be available only on Xbox and PlayStation 5 - to boost console sales and break software sales records.",
      "However, having a firm date of 26 May 2026 for GTA 6 means that other publishers can now avoid releasing their own games at the same time.",

    "story": [
      "More victims of the infected blood scandal will die without ever receiving full compensation, a government minister has said.",
      "The paymaster general Nick Thomas-Symonds was giving evidence to a special session of the public inquiry into what's been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history.",
      "It's thought 30,000 patients in the UK were infected with HIV or hepatitis B and C after being treated with a contaminated blood clotting product or given a blood transfusion in the 1970s and 80s.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds agreed it was \"profoundly unsatisfactory\" that just 106 final compensation awards have been paid, almost a year after a damning report into the scandal was published.",
      "What is the infected blood scandal?",
      "'Infected blood has ruined my life for 40 years'",
      "\"I'm never going to think this is satisfactory until everybody has received the compensation that is due,\" the Cabinet Office minister said.",
      "\"The objective should be absolutely to pay [people] as soon as possible.\"",
      "A final report into the scandal, published last year, found that the disaster could largely have been avoided if different decisions had been taken by the health authorities at the time.",
      "The report said too little was done to stop the importing of contaminated blood products from abroad in the 1970s and 80s, and there was evidence that elements of the scandal had been covered up.",
      "Last month the chair of the public inquiry, Sir Brian Langstaff, ordered two days of extra hearings after he received \"letter after letter, email after email\" expressing concerns about the way the government's compensation scheme has been managed.",
      "The Chancellor Rachel Reeves set aside \u00a311.8bn in the last budget to make final awards to victims and their family members, but the latest figures show less than 1% of that total, some \u00a397m, has been paid out to date.",
      "Survivors of the scandal and some bereaved relatives have also received a series of smaller interim compensation payments over the last three years.",
      "Eleven victims and their representatives gave evidence in an emotional panel session in front of an audience of around 300 people in Westminster.",
      "'Betrayed and disappointed'",
      "Andrew Evans, chair of the campaign group Tainted Blood, told the hearing many victims and their families had been left feeling \"betrayed and disappointed\".",
      "\"People have given up on any expectation of receiving anything,\" he said.",
      "\"They have lost all hope of ever getting justice and we can't be doing this for much longer.\"",
      "Other witnesses criticised the way in which individuals were being contacted and \"invited\" to come forward to claim final compensation, describing it as \"waiting for your lottery ticket to come up\".",
      "Gary Webster, a haemophiliac who was infected with HIV and hepatitis C when a pupil at Treloar's School in Hampshire in the 1970s and 80s, said that \"[some] people will not get their compensation and a lot of claims will die with them.\"",
      "\"It's just too slow and people won't get the justice they deserve,\" he added.",
      "Under the current rules, if someone infected with HIV or hepatitis B or C dies before receiving full compensation, then any final award can be passed on to their relatives through their estate.",
      "But compensation can also be claimed by those affected by the scandal \u2013 a partner, sibling or parent of a child, for example \u2013 for the separate impact on their lives.",
      "And if they die before that compensation is agreed, then their claim will die with them and cannot be passed on.",
      "In questioning later in the day, Mr Thomas-Symonds, who leads on the response for the government, said he was \"restless for further progress on payments\".",
      "The Infected Blood Compensation Authority (IBCA), an independent body set up to pay victims of the scandal, has said it expects the \"bulk\" of awards to be made to infected survivors by the end of 2027, with most of those affected, such as family members and carers, paid by the end of 2029.",
      "Mr Thomas-Symonds said he regarded that timeline as a \"backstop\" rather than a target to work towards.",
      "\"The logic for that is there may be other people who have not yet come forward at this stage [to claim],\" he said.",

      "Sir Rob said it was \"a disgrace\" how Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (EPUT) had failed in its care of 20-year-old Matthew Leahy, who died in 2012, and a 20-year-old man referred to as Mr R, who died in 2008.",
      "\"This was the National Health Service at its worst and needed calling out,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "'Near-complete failure'",
      "Sir Rob referred in his inquiry appearance to several reports made during his tenure, including \"Missed Opportunities\", which looked into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Mr Leahy and Mr R.",
      "Mr Leahy was found unresponsive at the Linden Centre in Chelmsford. He reported being raped there just days before he died.",
      "Sir Rob told the inquiry the PHSO identified \"19 instances of maladministration\" in Mr Leahy's case by North Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust - a predecessor to EPUT - including that his care plan was falsified.",
      "The former ombudsman said there had been \"a near-complete failure of the leadership of this trust, certainly before it was merged\" with South Essex Partnership Trust to become EPUT.",
      "\"This was an indictment of the health service,\" he added.",

      "Mr R was found unresponsive in the Linden Centre in December 2008 and died afterwards. Sir Rob Behrens found he had been failed multiple times by those treating him.",
      "\"Some clinicians were interviewed after he died, and they had a very patronising approach to him\" he told the inquiry.",
      "\"In their view, [Mr R] didn't have mental health problems at all, and he had been admitted because he wanted somewhere to live because he was homeless. That is staggering.\"",
      "'No confidence'",
      "In a report called \"Broken Trust\", published in 2023, Sir Rob referenced there were more than a dozen different health and care regulators playing important roles in patient safety.",
      "\"Political leaders have created a confusing landscapes of organisations, often in knee-jerk reaction to patient safety crisis points,\" the report said.",
      "Sir Rob agreed with a suggestion put to him by Nicholas Griffin KC, chief counsel to the inquiry, that some incidents \"fall through the gaps\" due to the complexity of the complaints process and therefore are not investigated.",
      "\"There are a lot of people who simply don't know where to go,\" Sir Rob said.",
      "\"At the moment, I have no confidence that people trust the system because they don't know where to go when they want to make a complaint.\"",
      "Sir Rob said that Essex was \"not exceptional\" and the issues he had discovered there could be seen in other places as well.",
      "\"The absence of leadership\u2026 not communicating effectively with patients, the safety issues around ligature points\u2026 and the absence of training and development - these are still issues which the NHS has to address generally, not just in Essex,\" he said.",
      "The former ombudsman also told the inquiry that he was prevented from investigating a significant number of deaths\u00a0due to a \"serious limitation\" in his office's powers.",
      "Sir Rob Behrens explained the ombudsman could only investigate following a complaint, but that for understandable reasons of bereavement or trauma, many families in Essex did not complain following the deaths of loved ones.",

      "It is estimated it could affect 1 in 25 women with a big baby who have a vaginal delivery.",

      "The government's efforts to fix the prison crisis may not work without \"bold investment decisions\", the leading union for the probation service has said.",
      "Ian Lawrence, general secretary of Napo, said a review of sentencing policy by former Conservative Justice Secretary David Gauke \"may come to little effect\" if the probation service was underfunded.",
      "The union boss said he supported proposals to scrap short sentences for some offenders and toughen up community orders supervised by probation officers.",
      "But he said probation staff were already \"overworked\" and suggested any \"cost cutting\" could increase pressure on the service.",

      "\"We are hiring 1,300 new probation officers, investing in technology to cut back on admin, and increasing focus on those offenders who pose the greatest risk to the public,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"This will ease pressure on the service, help cut reoffending and keep our streets safe.\"",
      "Gauke is understood to be considering recommending the idea of scrapping short prison terms as part of the sentencing review.",
      "The review comes as prisons across the country are struggling to deal with overcrowding after the number of offenders behind bars hit a new high.",
      "In an interim report, Gauke warned that unless radical changes were made, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells by early next year.",
      "Gauke's sentencing review is expected to be published this month, before the government sets out its spending plans for departments in June.",

      "The money allocated to government departments for the three years beyond 2025-26 will be set out in the spending review in June.",
      "Lawrence said a reduction in funding for the Ministry of Justice, which oversees the probation service, could mean less funding to support offenders in the community and worse outcomes.",
      "\"In other words, they go out of prison and they've got no option but to commit crime because they have no means of supporting themselves,\" he said.",
      "\"They're back in prison within weeks. And so it goes on and that costs the taxpayer millions.\"",

      "Lawrence said Napo was in dispute with the prison and probation service over pay progression and workloads.",
      "He said the union had submitted a claim for a 12% pay rise for probation staff this year.",
      "That's way above the increases independent pay review bodies have advised the government to give teachers (4%) and NHS workers (3%).",

      "\"We think senior leaders in [the service] have a responsibility to let ministers know the gravity of the situation,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is facing a growing rebellion by Labour MPs over planned welfare cuts some have warned are \"impossible to support\" without a \"change of direction\".",
      "In a letter to The Guardian, 42 MPs said proposed welfare savings worth \u00a35bn a year by 2030 had \"caused a huge amount of anxiety and concern among disabled people and their families\".",
      "The MPs urged ministers to delay any decisions until assessments of the potential impact of the cuts on employment and health had been published.",
      "A Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) source said a \"determination to help more people into work\" was at the heart of the benefits changes.",
      "\"We understand that there are concerns,\" the DWP source added.",
      "\"The secretary of state is engaging and talking to colleagues, explaining why these reforms will help transform people's lives.\"",
      "The letter comes before MPs are expected to vote on a new law that would bring the benefits cuts into effect next month.",
      "On Wednesday, nine Labour MPs spoke during a debate to say they would vote against the changes to a key disability benefit called personal independence payment (Pip) and universal credit (UC).",
      "In Labour's ranks of MPs there has been growing disquiet over the welfare reforms since the party suffered heavy losses in last week's local elections.",
      "In the letter, the 42 MPs said the planned cuts \"represent the biggest attack on the welfare state since George Osborne ushered in the years of austerity and over three million of our poorest and most disadvantaged will be affected\".",
      "It continued: \"Whilst the government may have correctly diagnosed the problem of a broken benefits system and a lack of job opportunities for those who are able to work, they have come up with the wrong medicine. Cuts don't create jobs, they just cause more hardship.\"",
      "The letter said the benefits system does need reform to tackle \"the barriers that disabled people face when trying to find and maintain employment\".",
      "\"Without a change in direction, the green paper will be impossible to support,\" it added.",
      "Letters to PM",
      "In March, the government released a green paper to spell out the details of its proposed shake-up of the benefits system.",
      "Overall, the government spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "The government estimated that 3.2 million families could be worse off as a result of the reforms, while 3.8 million families will be better off by 2030.",
      "MPs will get a chance to vote on the plans because the government needs to pass primary legislation to make the changes to welfare payments.",
      "The legislation is due to be published this month before making its way through Parliament in June.",
      "The BBC understands some of the signatories are also writing to the prime minister to press for a delay in the vote until the full impact assessment on health and employment is published.",
      "Alongside the welfare cuts, the government has put forward proposals to encourage more people receiving benefits to find work.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) was unable to say how effective those employment measures would be when it published its assessment of the green paper, citing a lack of detail from the government.",
      "Instead, the OBR plans to include an assessment of this element of the welfare changes in its autumn forecast.",
      "On Wednesday, Disability Minister Sir Stephen Timms defended the proposals, saying it was not sustainable for welfare spending to rise at the current rate.",
      "\"The current system produces poor employment outcomes, high economic inactivity, low living standards, high costs to the taxpayer. It needs to change,\" he said.",
      "\"We want a more proactive, pro-work system that supports people better and supports the economy as well.\"",
      "The BBC has been told some potential rebels are being assured they won't lose the party whip if they abstain \u2013 or make themselves scarce \u2013 when the vote comes.",
      "The government is not at risk of defeat, given Labour has a large majority, but a sizable rebellion could show the extent of the discontent within the party.",

    "summary": "It will leave a 10% import tax on most goods shipped from the UK to the US.",
    "story": [
      "The US has agreed to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminium into the country tariff-free, as part of a new agreement between the US and UK.",
      "The announcement offers relief for key UK industries from some of the new tariffs President Donald Trump has announced since his return to the White House in January.",
      "But it will leave a 10% duty in place on most goods from the UK.",
      "Though hailed by the leaders of the two countries as significant, analysts said it did not appear to meaningfully alter the terms of trade between the countries, as they stood before the changes introduced by Trump this year.",
      "No formal deal was signed on Thursday and the announcements from both governments were light on details.",
      "Speaking from a Jaguar Land Rover factory in the West Midlands, Sir Keir Starmer described the agreement as a \"fantastic platform\".",
      "\"This historic deal delivers for British business and British workers protecting thousands of British jobs in key sectors including car manufacturing and steel,\" he said, adding that the \"the UK has no greater ally than the United States\".",
      "At the White House, Trump called it a \"great deal\" and pushed back against criticism that he was overstating its importance.",
      "\"This is a maxed out deal that we're going to make bigger,\" he said.",
      "What is in the UK-US tariff deal?",
      "US agreement leaves the UK open to do a much more significant EU deal",
      "What's in the deal?",
      "The two sides said the US had agreed to reduce the import tax on cars - which Trump had raised by 25% last month - to 10% for 100,000 cars a year.",
      "That will help luxury carmakers such as Jaguar Land Rover and Rolls Royce, but could limit growth in the years ahead, as it amounts to roughly what the UK exported last year.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told the BBC the UK was days away from losing thousands of jobs at carmakers facing US tariffs.",
      "\"This was very serious,\" he said. \"It would have meant people would have lost their jobs without this breakthrough.\"",
      "Tariffs on steel and aluminium, which Trump raised earlier this year to 25%, have also been slashed, according to the Prime Minister's Office. The US said instead it would establish a quota, as had existed previously.",
      "The two countries also each agreed to allow the import of up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef from the other country, according to documents released by the US Trade Representative.",
      "The US said the change would significantly expand its sales of beef to the UK, which had previously faced 20% duties and were capped at 1,000 metric tonnes.",
      "Overall, the US said the deal would create a $5bn (\u00a33.8bn) \"opportunity\" for exports, including $700m in ethanol and $250m in other agricultural products.",
      "\"It can't be understated how important this deal is,\" US Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said.",
      "What's the reaction?",
      "UK Steel director General Gareth Stace welcomed the agreement, saying it would offer \"major relief\" to the steel sector.",
      "\"The UK government's cool-headed approach and perseverance in negotiating with the US clearly paid off,\" he said.",
      "Other business groups expressed more uncertainty.",
      "\"It's better\u00a0than yesterday but it's definitely not better than five weeks ago,\" said Duncan Edwards, chief executive of BritishAmerican Business, which represents firms in the two countries and supports free trade.",
      "\"I'm trying to be excited but I'm struggling a bit.\"",
      "While Labour MPs praised the deal, opposition parties asked for more detail and scrutiny in Parliament.",
      "Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticised the deal, saying it amounted to tariffs being lowered by the UK, while being hiked in the US.",
      "\"This is not a historic deal with the US,\" she said. \"We've been shafted.\"",
      "The Liberal Democrats demanded a vote on the deal in Parliament, saying it would show \"complete disrespect to the public\" if MPs were denied a say.",
      "Sir Ed Davey said: \"When it comes to any trade deal - and especially one with someone as unreliable as Donald Trump - the devil will be in the detail.",
      "\"One thing is clear, Trump's trade tariffs are still hitting key British industries, threatening the livelihoods of people across the UK.\"",
      "Reform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the deal was a \"step in the right direction\".",
      "He told the BBC there was more detail to come but in the round it was a welcome development.",
      "\"The important point is that we are doing stuff, we are making a move,\" he said. \"It's a Brexit benefit we were able to do this.\"",
      "Win for US ranchers?",
      "The US and UK have been discussing a trade deal since Trump's first term. They came close to signing a mini-agreement at that time.",
      "But the US has long pushed for changes to benefit its farmers and pharmaceutical issues, which had been non-starters politically for the UK.",
      "It was not clear how much those issues had advanced.",
      "The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the agreement in-principle had delivered a \"tremendous win\" for American ranchers but the US Meat Export Federation, which tracks trade barriers for farmers in the US, said it was still trying to pin down information about the changes.",
      "The UK said there would be no weakening in food standards for imports.",
      "While the UK appears to have made some commitments, \"the devil will be in the details,\" said Michael Pearce, deputy chief economist at Oxford Economics, which said it was making no change to its economic forecasts as a result of the announcement.",
      "Other issues loom.",
      "Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to tax imports of pharmaceuticals, in a bid to ensure the US has a strong manufacturing base for critical medicines.",
      "The UK said the US had agreed to give British firms \"preferential treatment\".",
      "But Ewan Townsend, a lawyer at Arnold & Porter, who works with health care firms, said the industry was now \"left waiting to see exactly what this preferential treatment will mean\"."

      "A Labour MP has raised fresh concerns over the government's failure to properly monitor whether migrants leave the UK after their visas expire.",
      "The UK does not record all individuals leaving the country through border checks,  relying instead on matching flight, sea, and rail  passenger data with visa records.",
      "The government has promised to set out plans to crack down on record-high levels of migration in the next few weeks.",

      "Net migration - the number of people coming to the UK, minus the number leaving - hit a record 906,000 in the year to June 2023, and then fell to 728,000 in the year to June 2024.",
      "But the Office of National Statistics (ONS) has admitted the figures are not completely accurate and are instead an \"experimental\" statistic - which has previously led to the systematic underestimating of EU migrants and overestimating of others.",
      "New rules introduced by former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak in a bid to reduce migration levels are thought to have contributed to the latest fall in numbers.",
      "Since April 2024, those apply for a visa have needed a job offer with a salary at least \u00a338,700 - an increase of nearly 50% from the previous \u00a326,200 minimum.",
      "The threshold does not apply to some jobs - such as in health and social care, and teachers on national pay scales.",
      "During an evidence session of the Public Accounts Committee, Marc Owen, the director for visa status said his team \"were not tracking every single individual\" working in the UK.",
      "Pressed by Betts at the committee, Mr Owen said the government \"can only know\" if someone has left the country by matching airline passenger data with visa records.",
      "Instead of tracking exits, the Home Office relies on employers carrying out visa checks and enforcement squads to catch those overstaying their visas.",
      "\"We use our immigration enforcement services to visit illegal working places on the basis of intelligence and to collect people and to return them as they can,\" he said.",
      "Home Office Permanent Secretary Dame Antonia Romeo said overstaying is \"a problem\" the department is now \"fixing,\" with support from HMRC and local councils.",
      "\"We're not saying it's been solved,\" she said. \"We are identifying the issues and putting in place fixes.\"",
      "The Home Office were also working to modernise border security and boost digital checks, Mr Owen said.",
      "Currently the Home Office do not know who is \"here or not, that is the reality\", Betts said.",
      "Visa holders who have not \"gone through your systems they just disappear and they're in the black economy,\" he warned.",
      "Betts told the BBC the lack of exit checks were the symptom of a \"general failure of the border system over several governments\" leading to a splintered fight against abuse of the system.",
      "Betts urged the government to make visa checks the backbone of its new immigration plan, expected imminently.",
      "Full details of government's immigration plans are due to be published in a new immigration white paper later in May.",

      "Urban economist Paul Swinney told peers that pub spending data suggested that in the capital, post-work drinks have switched from Friday to Thursday.",
      "But a similar shift could not be seen in other large British cities, he added, where spending in bars was more likely to shift into the weekend.",
      "He also added that a decline in city-centre spending had not been matched by a similar increase for high streets outside urban centres.",

      "Last month, the think tank published research on the pre and post-pandemic spending patterns of city-centre workers in pubs and bars around their places of work, by comparing credit and debit card data from 2019 and 2024.",
      "The analysis showed that during that period, the share of weekly spending in pubs in central London on Fridays fell, whilst on Thursdays it rose, making it the most most popular night of the week.",

      "\"It appeared from the data that we have that the post-work drink has reduced in those other places.",

      "\"That might have happened a little bit, but certainly not to the extent that people were suggesting [during the pandemic],\" he told the committee.",
      "He added that suburban supermarkets had \"probably been the biggest winner\" from the shift in spending patterns since Covid.",

    "story": [
      "Prisons minister James Timpson has told the BBC more criminals could be tagged in future instead of being sent to prison - but insists he's not \"soft on crime\".",
      "More than 30 companies, including Microsoft and Google, will meet the government today to explore how technology could help monitor offenders in the community more effectively and tackle violence in prison.",
      "Lord Timpson says tagging more people instead of sending them to prison is a potential alternative punishment.",
      "But critics have questioned his previous comments about the UK being \"addicted\" to sentencing and punishment, and how \"only a third\" of inmates should be in prison.",
      "\"I don't think I'm soft on crime at all,\" Lord Timpson says in the wide-ranging BBC interview. \"I think I'm pretty tough in my style. In business, I'm tough but I use the evidence - and in this job I'm using the evidence.\"",
      "He says he is passionate about rehabilitating offenders in prison so they don't commit further crimes when released. However, 38.3% of adult criminals in England and Wales go on to reoffend within a year of being let out of prison.",
      "\"How do we reduce re-offending? How do we deal with people's drug addiction, mental health problems, the fact that people leave prison they don't know where to live, people don't have a job? That is also a really important part of my job,\" he says.",
      "How many people are in prison and who is being released early from jail?",
      "The former CEO of the Timpson Group, which provides key cutting and shoe repair services, is known for hiring ex-offenders and is a former chairman of the Prison Reform Trust.",
      "Lord Timpson took up his role at the Ministry of Justice in July last year, when the penal system in England and Wales was close to breaking point. Prisons were full, and months later thousands of inmates were released early as part of an emergency plan to ease overcrowding and free up space.",
      "He says prisons are still in a state of \"crisis\", with fewer than 1,000 spare places and more than 88,000 people in custody in England and Wales.",
      "\"We recently opened HMP Millsike,\" he says, describing the new category C prison which opened in East Yorkshire in March, with capacity for up to 1,500 inmates. \"We've got more cells opening across the country. We need to keep building prison places because the population is going up.\"",
      "Last month, three prison officers were seriously injured at HMP Frankland, in Durham, after they were attacked with makeshift weapons and hot oil by one of the men responsible for the Manchester Arena bombing. Hashem Abedi was being held in a separation centre - used to house a small number of the most dangerous and extremist inmates - at the category A, maximum security jail.",
      "\"What happened in Frankland is absolutely shocking,\" Lord Timpson says. \"The level of violence in prisons is far too high - and it is increasing.",
      "\"Our prison staff did an incredible job. I don't want them to turn up to work thinking that there's going to be violence. I want them to turn up to work helping people turn their lives around.\"",
      "However, the number of assaults on staff in prison is the highest in a decade, with 10,605 recorded in 2024.",
      "Violence, overcrowding, self-harm: BBC goes inside one of Britain\u2019s most dangerous prisons",

      "Prison officers deal drugs and ask inmates for sex, BBC told",
      "Probation: 'Too few staff, with too little experience, managing too many offenders'",
      "Lord Timpson refutes claims that gangs are in charge of some of Britain's biggest jails, but acknowledges that serious organised crime is the one thing that \"keeps me awake at night\".",
      "\"Serious organised crime brings drugs in and creates violence and intimidation in prisons,\" he says. \"This has been a long-term problem in prisons, but it is even more of a problem when the capacity is as full as it is.",
      "\"If we had people who went to prison who didn't get drugs and weren't intimidated by serious organised criminals, they'd be far more likely to engage with a sentence and get well enough so that when they leave they don't commit further crime.\"",
      "Why Starmer hired key-cutting boss as prisons minister",
      "The government has commissioned an independent sentencing review to explore alternatives to prison in an attempt to ease overcrowding. The review will provide long-term solutions for the justice system and examine the use and composition of non-custodial sentences, including community alternatives to prison and the use of fines. Increased tagging will also be considered.",
      "The total number of people fitted with an electronic monitoring device in England and Wales on 30 June 2024 was 20,893, an increase of 17% on the previous year.",
      "There are three types of ankle tags currently used to monitor offenders: alcohol, GPS, and curfew tags. A new study suggests tags that monitor curfews cut reoffending by 20%.",
      "\"We want them to have a one-way ticket - not a return back into prison or back into non-custodial sentences,\" Lord Timpson says.",
      "\"What's really important is we embrace technology and look at the evidence - tagging can have some very important benefits.\"",
      "But the use of electronic tagging to monitor offenders has been problematic. In recent months several probation staff have told the BBC offenders who should be tagged, have not been. The security company Serco has been contracted by the government to manage tagging since October 2023.",
      "\"We inherited a contract with Serco and it's been far from perfect,\" Lord Timpson says. \"We're putting a lot of pressure still on them to perform, but we need to work together to make sure that people are tagged on time in the right way. Things are getting better, but we're not there yet.\"",
      "Anthony Kirby, Serco Group CEO, told the BBC he is pleased the prisons minister has recognised the progress Serco has made since taking over the electronic monitoring service: \"We are proud of the role we have supporting the Criminal Justice System, monitoring record numbers of people in the community and protecting public safety in partnership with HMPPS.\"",

      "During Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch pressed Sir Keir to \"listen to his own party and change course\".",

      "\"That is to deal with the \u00a322bn black hole that they left. Because of our action, we've stabilised the economy.\"",
      "He also stressed the government was committed to the triple lock, under which pensions go up each year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5%.",
      "Hitting back, Badenoch said: \"The only black hole is the one the prime minister is digging.",
      "\"This issue affects some of the poorest and most vulnerable pensioners. His mayor in Doncaster says it's wrong. His first minister in Wales says it's wrong. Even his own MPs are saying it's wrong. He's refused to listen to me on this, will he at least listen to his own party and change course?\"",
      "In response, Sir Keir said: \"No other party is saying how they would invest in our NHS and public services.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also urged the PM to reverse the cuts, saying this was \"among the messages voters sent ministers last week\".",
      "The winter fuel payment is a lump sum worth between \u00a3200 and \u00a3300, designed to help with higher energy costs during the colder weather.",
      "It was previously paid to all pensioners but last year the government restricted this to only the poorest, who qualify for pension credit and other income-related benefits, in a bid save \u00a31.4bn.",
      "The move, which did not feature in Labour's general election manifesto, means around nine million pensioners no longer qualify for the payment.",
      "Labour MPs who oppose the cuts believe a reversal of the policy would be a clear sign from the prime minister that he is listening to voters.",
      "However, others closer to government thinking question whether there would be any political benefit to changing course at this stage, believing the damage has already been done.",
      "Criticism of changes to disability benefits, which would make it harder for people to claim Personal Independence Payment (Pip), could become a more pressing issue, with a vote in the House of Commons likely next month.",

    "summary": "Labour has dominated Welsh politics for more than a century. Next year, could that come to an end?",
    "story": [
      "You have to go back more than 100 years, to before 1922, for an election where Labour was not dominating Welsh politics.",
      "Rooted in the industrial heritage of the country which was once the home of the UK's first Labour MP, Keir Hardie, the party has beat all others in Wales in every major Westminster election ever since.",
      "Labour has always been the largest party in Cardiff Bay too, and has won every election for the Welsh Parliament.",
      "But for the first time, the outlook for Welsh Labour at the next Senedd election on May 7 2026 is much less clear.",
      "Led by Eluned Morgan, it faces a fight to hold on to the reins of the Welsh government, and the sway it has held over Welsh politics.",
      "How do you vote in the Senedd election?",
      "What's your Senedd constituency?",
      "What does the Senedd do?",
      "Polls have shown Labour neck and neck with two parties - the pro-independence Plaid Cymru, and Nigel Farage's Reform UK.",
      "But a survey published this week suggested Plaid Cymru was pulling ahead, with Labour falling behind Farage.",
      "Both Plaid and Reform are hoping they can leapfrog Labour and become the largest group in the Senedd, as are the Welsh Conservatives, who are polling behind the other three.",
      "A new voting system means the next Senedd could be split between about four parties of a similar size, raising questions about exactly how the next Welsh government could be brought together.",
      "A senior Tory has said a coalition in the next parliament is \"nailed on\", and there is talk among some about whether parties would need to share the top job of first minister.",
      "The Welsh Parliament, or Senedd Cymru, is what we now call the institution set up as the National Assembly in 1999.",
      "Whoever can command control of the parliament forms the Welsh government - the ministers which run the services Westminster decided to hand over to Cardiff Bay, including the NHS.",
      "While it has never won a majority, Labour has led every single government since 1999, with the assistance of Plaid and the Lib Dems.",
      "The potential for a shake-up in the Senedd is partly down to plans to expand the number of politicians there from 60 to 96 - the brainchild of former First Minister Mark Drakeford and former Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price.",
      "As well as more politicians, the new parliament is likely to better reflect the proportion of votes won by each party - more so than the mixed system used up until now.",
      "This is important when it is considered against polls that suggest Welsh voters are divided.",
      "Two recent ones - from Survation and Beaufort Research - have put Labour ahead of Plaid and Reform but only just.",
      "But a poll by ITV Wales and Cardiff University conducted in late April placed Plaid on 30%, with Reform behind on 25% and Labour on 18% - a historic low. The Conservatives were placed at 13%, the Lib Dems 7% and the Greens 5%.",
      "All recent polling for Labour on Senedd voting intention is lower than how the party performed at the last general election, where it got 37% of the vote.",
      "Cardiff University politics expert Prof Richard Wyn Jones said the previous mixed proportional and first-past-the-post system helped Labour win around 50% of the seats in Wales with \"a third of the vote\".",
      "He said elections in both Wales and Scotland next year will be the \"most high-profile test for the Starmer administration\".",
      "\"It would be utterly seismic if they are not the largest party in Wales,\" he told BBC Wales.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones spoke before Tuesday's poll was published - as did everyone else in this article. He said Labour's chances of coming first should not be written off.",
      "\"But even if Labour is only barely ahead, that would be seismic because it would mean the Labour group in the Senedd is essentially not much bigger than the current Labour group in the Senedd, and the Senedd would be 36 seats bigger,\" he said.",
      "So, what could be behind it all?",
      "The post-pandemic period has been tough for Welsh Labour \u2013 plunged into crisis over the donation of \u00a3200,000 from a man convicted of illegally dumping waste to its now-former leader, Vaughan Gething.",
      "The row exposed splits within the Labour group of 30 MSs. Despite Welsh Labour having a landslide general election result, several Welsh ministers resigned to force Gething's ouster, prompting the rise of Morgan as first minister.",
      "Even before Drakeford decided to step down in late 2023, triggering the leadership contest that Gething won, Labour MSs had been arguing over transport policies, including the default 20mph speed limit, while the government has been struggling with long waits in the Welsh NHS.",
      "Former Labour special advisor turned lobbyist Cathy Owens, of Cavendish Cymru, partly blamed the leadership crisis and factors at a UK level.",
      "Or, as she puts it: \"As soon as Labour won power at UK level... everybody realised that Keir Starmer wasn't the most exciting leader we've had and then Labour had to make lots of difficult decisions.\"",
      "'We were lecturing over 20mph'",
      "NHS waits and the controversial 20mph speed limit were always among the top three issues relayed on the doorstep at the general election, according to a well-connected Welsh Labour activist.",
      "They said a mix of Welsh and UK issues were at play, but argued that the Welsh government \"got complacent\".",
      "The activist blamed the \"way\" the 20mph speed limit was delivered - \"it told voters we weren't listening to them and we were essentially lecturing them\".",
      "\"I agree with the desired outcomes of the policy, but you can't treat voters like that,\" they said.",
      "Alun Davies, Labour Blaenau Gwent MS, acknowledged the public was \"frustrated with politics\" but said: \"Labour remains the party that probably most people in Wales feel represents their own values.\"",
      "The politician, who is involved in the production of the party's manifesto, said: \"Eluned has got the power to transform Welsh Labour's fortunes during an election campaign.",
      "\"She is very straight-talking - what you see is what you get.\"",
      "Wales' Labour first minister says she will 'call out' Starmer",
      "Politics 'doesn't work' for many people in Wales",
      "Cathy Owens said the current first minister needed two things to get to 30% of the vote or more, \"one of which is to reduce waiting times\".",
      "For the second thing, Ms Owens said Morgan needed help from her party colleagues in the UK government - \"some funding, or some extra investment\" over and above what is automatically provided through the existing Barnett formula system, which is largely based on population.",
      "\"Now, that is proving more of a sticky wicket,\" she said. \"There has been no evidence of a win so far on that\".",
      "The relationship between Welsh and Westminster Labour has become a big part of the story of Morgan's time as Welsh Labour leader.",
      "She has been increasingly keen to distance herself from Sir Kier Starmer - on Tuesday she gave a speech where she was willing to call out his government, should it take decisions that \"harm\" Welsh communities.",
      "'The polls tell a good story'",
      "One party hoping to benefit from the turn in Labour's fortunes is Plaid Cymru.",
      "The left-leaning party has long struggled to beat its strong showing in the first assembly election of 1999 when it won almost 29% of the vote, but the splintering of British politics has presented Plaid with an opportunity.",
      "Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth has been presenting himself as a first minister in waiting, while the party has published plans on health and the economy it said it would enact if it formed the next Welsh government.",
      "Unlike their political cousins in Scotland, the SNP, Plaid has never won a Welsh election and came third last time round.",
      "It took part in a short-lived coalition with Labour between 2007 and 2011, and helped Labour govern more recently in the form of the co-operation deal which ended in summer 2024.",
      "\"We're not getting too carried away with the polls,\" Plaid's Senedd party chairman Llyr Gruffydd said. \"But the polls do tell a good story for us.\"",
      "\"We will clearly be highlighting the need for change. It's a tired government.\"",
      "He said the party will face a challenge in helping \"people realise that this is a different electoral system. Every single vote counts - there will not be a wasted vote\".",
      "It was put to Gruffydd that it was difficult for Plaid to be seen as anti-establishment when it had been involved in helping Labour govern. \"We won't shy away from the fact that we've been punching above our weight... and still achieving elements of our manifesto,\" he said. \"Imagine what we could do if we were in government.\"",
      "'There's so much frustration'",
      "One party hoping to make their big entrance into Welsh politics is Farage's Reform UK.",
      "The party has polled closely to Labour and Plaid Cymru and came second in 13 seats at the last general election. While it has five MPs in England, and some councillors in Wales, it has no-one at Senedd at present.",
      "It is celebrating its recent English local election successes, where it made big gains, won control of 10 councils, two mayors and a by-election from Labour.",
      "Pointing to who the party is in Wales is difficult - it is yet to decide who will stand for them at the next election, or who might act as a figurehead.",
      "They are not starting from scratch - Farage's previous party UKIP had a short-lived stint in the Senedd after it won seven AMs in 2017.",
      "At least one of their former AMs is hoping to become a Reform MS - Caroline Jones. She is hoping to stand for Reform in the seat of Pen-y-bont Bro Morgannwg - which covers Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan.",
      "Opponents accuse Reform of simply being a protest party, something that would be denied by Jones. She told BBC Wales that another former UKIP Senedd politician, and one-time Tory MP and ex-Abolish the Assembly AM, Mark Reckless, was working with a team on policy for the Senedd.",
      "\"At the moment, there's so much frustration among the public - we are offering something different.\"",
      "Jones added: \"You have to have a party that's representative of the people, as opposed to just representing their own interests.\"",
      "UKIP's time in the Senedd was characterised by two changes in leadership, rows, and splits. At one point there were more UKIP AMs who had been leader than had not - including Jones herself.",
      "\"The Reform party is united,\" she said. \"There are hardly any arguments at all, and anything that people disagree on.\"",
      "Other parties may try to capitalise on Farage's relationship with the controversial US president Donald Trump to galvanise opposition to Reform.",
      "Jones said that was not a negative: \"If we've got special links with America, then I think it's to be capitalised on.\"",
      "Asked if she thought the party needed a Welsh figurehead, she said: \"That's above my pay grade.\"",
      "'This is what we're for'",
      "The Conservatives have a relatively new leader in the Senedd - Darren Millar, who took over late last year after a row over the leadership of Andrew RT Davies.",
      "Under Millar the party has tried to present itself as a serious alternative to Labour, with the Senedd leader keen to show he can be the next first minister and not simply an opposition force.",
      "But the Tories are still in the shadow of a disastrous general election, where the party went from having won 14 seats in the 2019 vote to zero. Recently it has been polling in fourth place. It came second in the Senedd election in 2021.",
      "Samuel Kurtz, chairman of the Tory group in the Senedd, said he was excited by the prospect of the election and the \"opportunities of a different political landscape come 8 May 2026\".",
      "The MS for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire said: \"We need to put forward a positive vision for what Wales could look like. We have had 25 years of the same party in charge, the same government, and a tried and tested method of pretty much trying the same thing.",
      "\"It's saying, look, this is what we're for. We're for a stronger economy, we're for the ability for families to have choice over certain things like education, we're for agriculture, we're for tourism.\"",
      "He added: \"What we've really done with Darren is really hunker down as to what is our USP as Welsh Conservatives, what are we for... rather than just saying we are against the 20mph speed limit for example, or we're against the tourism tax.\"",
      "Asked why he thought the Welsh Conservatives were struggling in polls, former Senedd Tory adviser Anthony Pickles said: \"Because the national party is still so involved in trying to work out its future strategy, its very difficult for the Welsh Conservatives to be diverging, and creating their own brand proposition\".",
      "Smaller parties are thought to be at a disadvantage in the new system - with experts suggesting parties need 13% to 15% to win seats.",
      "That is not to say they won't try - with the Greens among those who will be hoping to enter the Welsh Parliament for the first time.",
      "The Liberal Democrats, who won one regional seat at the last Senedd election and one at the last general election, are hoping to win more.",
      "Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds previously told the BBC: \"We'll have gold everywhere. Look at what we did in England [at the last general election].",
      "\"No-one thought we would win 72 seats. The results were coming in fast and furious that night and I reckon it is going to be like that next May as well.\"",
      "Who could work with who?",
      "It is early days, but the prospect of the electorate being split four ways or more raises questions about how the next government could be formed.",
      "Politicians can be reluctant to talk about the topic with 12 months to go, but for Labour, you would assume a deal with the Conservatives or Reform would be unthinkable. Ministers have instead worked with Plaid and the Lib Dems in the past.",
      "Plaid have ruled out working with Reform, but not Labour or the Tories.",
      "The Conservative's Kurtz declined to talk about who the party might work with, but said the likelihood of a coalition is \"nailed on - it'll have to be a coalition. No one party will reach the threshold of governing on their own\".",
      "Plaid's Gruffydd said a rotating first ministership - similar to how the coalition running the Irish government has operated with rotating prime ministers - \"could be on the agenda\".",
      "\"It depends on the arithmetic,\" he said, suggesting it could be discussed if there are \"two parties thoroughly at the same kind of level\".",
      "But Ms Owens said if Labour held at 27% as in some recent polls, you are \"more likely to have a Labour first minister\", with the party a few seats or more ahead of Plaid.",
      "Prof Wyn Jones also argued the upheaval in geopolitics could play a role.",
      "It could not be predicted, he argued, whether something happening worldwide could make people feel more positive about Labour.",
      "The expert added: \"This is such a hugely uncertain time that everything that we are saying needs to be caveated.\""

      "The anger among Labour MPs in the aftermath of the party's local elections drubbing was striking in its breadth and depth. The evidence so far is that it did not dissipate over the long weekend.",
      "The focus of many MPs' rage - and it is rage - is the means-testing of the winter fuel allowance.",
      "It is not just the view of critical MPs that this harmed Labour in the elections, but of cabinet ministers too.",
      "Earlier Health Secretary Wes Streeting told Breakfast: \"I'm not going to insult your viewers by pretending that winter fuel didn't come up on the doorstep, of course it did, and I know that people aren't happy about winter fuel allowance in lots of cases.\"",
      "Government sources spent Tuesday morning scotching the suggestion that a formal review of the policy is under way, and by the afternoon they were adamant.",

      "Others closer to government thinking questioned whether there would be any political benefit to changing course at this stage, believing the damage has been done.",
      "Given the categorical denial of any wiggle room on winter fuel, more topical perhaps is the debate over the government's welfare reforms.",
      "The changes in eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (Pip) were announced in March but require parliamentary approval. A vote in the House of Commons is likely next month.",

      "One Labour MP who identified winter fuel and Pip as the two key reasons for Labour's poor showing last week said the latter was a more acute problem.",
      "\"When people were complaining about winter fuel on the doorstep you'd look at the [canvassing] sheet and often it's people who have never voted for us or haven't voted for us for a long time. With Pip, they were our people.\"",
      "Even those Labour MPs who are more frustrated than angry at the decline in the party's support over the past ten months believe that Sir Keir and his team need to do more to carry their parliamentary ranks with them.",

Though the principal beneficiary of Thursday's local elections at Labour's expense was Reform UK, there are plenty in Labour who worry just as much about bleeding votes on their left flank to more progressive parties such as the Greens.",
      "Many are noting that in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election the Conservative vote more than halved, at least partly due to defections to Labour to stop Reform. Meanwhile, the Green vote actually nudged upwards.",
      "\"We couldn't squeeze the progressive vote - and we'll need to do that at the general election,\" one government source said.",
      "Cooler heads believe that in the scenario of a general election where the most plausible prime ministers were Sir Keir or Nigel Farage, voters on the broad left would inevitably coalesce around Labour.",

      "True, the party's share of the votes cast across all 23 councils where elections took place on Thursday was no more than 31%. So despite doing well, it secured far from a majority of those voting.",
      "However, its performance was enough to put Reform well ahead of the Conservatives \u2013 who traditionally dominate county councils - on 23%, the Liberal Democrats on 17% and Labour on 14% when you tally up the votes in those parts of England that went to the polls on Thursday.",

      "Local elections 2025 in maps and charts",
      "At the 2024 general election Reform secured 14% of the vote but just 5 out of 650 seats at Westminster. But crucially, being ahead of everyone else in 2025 ensured the first-past-the-post election system helped Reform.",
      "Its tally of 677 council seats represented 41% of all those being contested on Thursday, 10 points above its share of the vote, a nod to both the nature of the voting system and Reform's ability to cluster votes. That boost helped the party win control of as many as 10 councils, something that Reform's predecessor, UKIP, never managed at the height of its popularity in the run up to the 2015 general election.",
      "In Staffordshire, Reform won 72% of the seats on 41% of the vote. In Kent, 37% of the vote delivered it 70% of the seats, while in Derbyshire the same share was rewarded with 66% of all the councillors.",

      "In wards where more than 65% voted Leave in 2016, Reform won on average as much as 45% of the vote. In contrast, in places where a majority backed Remain, only 19% voted for Reform.",
      "Although talked about much less by politicians nowadays, Brexit is still an important fault line in our politics. Reform's appeal is significantly concentrated among those who believe the Brexit decision was right.",
      "Even so, the fact that even in pro-Remain wards the party was able to win as much as a fifth of the vote was testimony to the scale of the swing that it enjoyed on Thursday.",
      "The Brexit division is also evident in the demographic character of the places where Reform did best and those where it did less well.",
      "University graduates and those in professional and managerial jobs were least likely to vote for Brexit in 2016. Reform found it more difficult to do well in places where they are most numerous.",
      "Reform won 39% of the vote in heavily working-class wards but only 19% in the most middle-class ones.",
      "The map shows Reform's highest vote of all (65.1%) was in Thornley & Wheatley Hill, situated in Tony Blair's former Sedgefield constituency in Durham and once a centre of coal mining. Next highest was Romney Marsh in Kent and Chadsmoor in Staffordshire.",
      "Meanwhile, support for the party averaged 43% in wards where more than half of adults have few, if any, educational qualifications. In contrast, it polled just 19% where more than two in five have a degree.",
      "Reform's lowest share of the vote, 3.7%, was in the Parks ward in Oxford, situated in the heart of the famous university city.",
      "Immigration is also a key issue for Reform. However, this perhaps makes the party less appealing to those from a minority background.",
      "Certainly, on average the party only polled 22% in wards where more than one in five identify as other than 'white', compared with a tally of 33% in places where more than 95% told the 2021 Census that they were 'white'.",
      "In summary, Reform did best in what has sometimes been characterised in the wake of the Brexit referendum as 'left-behind' Britain \u2013 places that have profited less from globalisation and university expansion and where a more conservative outlook on immigration is more common.",
      "A problem for the two main parties",
      "Neither the Conservatives nor Labour are likely to recover from the drubbing they received on Thursday unless they can appeal more to this slice of Britain.",
      "Although polls indicate that Reform finds it easier to win over former Conservative voters than their Labour counterparts, Reform's average share of the vote was strikingly just as high in wards that Labour were defending as it was in places that the Conservatives were trying to retain.",
      "The party on average won 32% of the vote in previously Labour wards and 32% in Conservative ones.",
      "As a result, Labour lost seats to Reform at much the same rate as the Conservatives, a pattern that cost Labour control of the one council they were defending, Doncaster.",
      "In contrast, Reform's advance was more muted in wards that the Liberal Democrats and the Greens were defending.  The party's average share in these wards was just 22%. As a result, Reform had relatively little success in taking seats from these two parties.",
      "Liberal Democrat and Green wards \u2013 unlike many Conservative and Labour ones - are heavily populated by university graduates.",
      "Reform's success on Thursday undoubtedly reflects the mood of an electorate that still has little faith in the Conservatives and which now is disappointed by Labour's performance in office.",
      "However, it is evidently proving most popular in a very distinctive part of Britain that overturned the political tables a decade ago in voting for Brexit - and which now has done so again.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 04:54:59 GMT",
    "summary": "A powerful prime minister tries and fails to stop an Old Labour stalwart's progress to City Hall.",
    "story": [
      "Regional mayors are now commonplace in England: Andy Burnham in Greater Manchester, Ben Houchen in the Tees Valley and Tracy Brabin in West Yorkshire are all well-known spokespeople for their areas.",
      "But the most prominent directly-elected mayor in Britain was also the first: London.",
      "As is fitting for a city as exciting as London, the first election for that coveted position included allegations of betrayal, stitch ups and intrigue \u2013 and one candidate ended up in prison.",
      "Twenty five years ago Tony Blair's government, elected in 1997 and known as New Labour, was very keen on a new form of devolution.",
      "They wanted mayors like those in America, big personalities elected with powers and budgets (but not too many powers, or too big a budget).",
      "In the end, only one was created by Blair's government.",
      "The 1998 Greater London Authority referendum, held in May that year, asked whether there was support for creating a Greater London Authority with a directly elected mayor and Assembly.",
      "The voters were less keen than New Labour - just 34% turned out to vote, but the majority was clear nonetheless: 72% in favour.",
      "The 'Yes' vote won in every London borough, with support lowest in Bromley with 57% and highest in Haringey with 84%.",
      "Now London was to have a mayor, who would it be?",
      "The obvious candidate was Ken Livingstone, the former left-wing firebrand (and publicity-friendly) leader of the Greater London Council (GLC), who went toe-to-toe with the Thatcher government - and lost.",
      "The GLC was abolished in 1986, leaving London in the unenviable position of having 32 boroughs (and the City of London) but no overall strategic elected body for the largest city in Europe.",
      "However, Livingstone's ability to alienate prime ministers wasn't confined to Conservatives.",
      "Tony Blair was also not a Ken fan.",
      "\"Red\" Ken, as he was known, was Old Labour, not New Labour.",
      "The message from Downing St was clear: Stop Ken.",
      "The party management tried to get the very popular Mo Mowlam to stand, then switched to Frank Dobson.",
      "A bearded, avuncular figure who was serving as New Labour's first health secretary, he was 'persuaded' to stand against his old comrade Ken.",
      "Dobson had initially, and somewhat bravely, declared his desire to remain at health, but then had to give up his cabinet seat to run for a job he didn't want.",
      "The internal workings of Labour can be difficult for outsiders - and many insiders - to navigate.",
      "In this case, an electoral college was mandated which led to the popular Livingstone not winning selection.",
      "The vote was a third each for party members, trade unions and London MPs and other elected representatives.",
      "In the final ballot Livingstone won 60% of party members and 72% of affiliated unions, but Dobson won 86% of MPs, MEPs and Greater London Assembly candidates.",
      "Dobson therefore won a narrow overall victory, and the Blairites were accused of rigging the whole thing to keep Old Labour Ken from the nomination.",
      "Livingstone for his part had promised not to run as an independent, then decided that that was what he was going to do after all.",
      "The Tories also had a colourful time choosing their candidate.",
      "In September 1999 the novelist Jeffrey Archer was selected by party members, beating Steve Norris.",
      "But in a plot twist reminiscent of one of his books, Archer withdrew from the race a few months later after it was alleged he had committed perjury in a famous libel case.",
      "Lord Archer had secured the Conservative nomination with backing from former prime ministers Margaret Thatcher and John Major, who in 1992 had made him a peer.",
      "Five years earlier, in 1987, Archer had won a libel case against The Daily Star which published a story that he had paid off a sex worker called Monica Coghlan.",
      "After his selection as a mayoral candidate, a former friend of Archer's told the News of the World that he had lied in the libel trial and asked him to provide a false alibi.",
      "Archer stood down from the race, and starred in a production of his courtroom play, The Accused, in London's West End while waiting for his trial to start.",
      "In July 2001 he was found guilty and spent two years in jail, but retained his peerage and membership of the House of Lords as there was no mechanism to remove them at the time.",
      "Norris was selected as the Conservative Party candidate to replace Archer.",
      "A very different type of Tory, Norris advocated for gay rights and had a relaxed approach to monogamy.",
      "He was also a former transport minister who was obsessed with buses.",
      "In that role, he had a hand in approving the Jubilee line extension from Green Park to Stratford, and the privatisation of London's bus services.",
      "In the rough and tumble world of turn of the century politics, he was given the nickname \"Shagger\".",
      "A brief snippet from a Guardian profile piece published during that first mayoral campaign gives a flavour of Norris' complex appeal.",
      "\"The day his original candidature was announced was marked by a letter to the Times from his father-in-law, a retired rear-admiral, expressing astonishment at Norris's public plans to marry the fourth of his famous five mistresses \u2026 since as far as the rear-admiral knew, Norris was still married to his daughter.\"",
      "Norris was a self-made man, a millionaire car salesman who grew up in working class Liverpool, attending the same school as Paul McCartney.",
      "Not many 2025 Tories can boast that sort of hinterland.",
      "There may have been some intrigue in the Lib Dem selection process, but it is lost to history if there was.",
      "Their candidate was the estimable Susan Kramer, who was subjected to condescension and mansplaining throughout the campaign - this was a time when female Labour MPs were referred to as \"Blair's Babes\" by tabloid and broadsheet newspapers alike.",
      "Livingstone was to mount the first - and so far only - successful independent bid for Mayor of London.",
      "Dobson ran a campaign that never really captured the imagination of London's voters, and his old comrade won the historic poll despite a late surge in support for the Tory candidate.",
      "The May 2000 election was a disaster for New Labour: Dobson got just 13% of the vote and was eliminated in the first round along with Susan Kramer, who polled a respectable 11.9% for the Lib Dems.",
      "Livingstone led by 39% to 27% of first preference votes and polled a total of 776,427 votes to 564,137 for Norris, after second preferences were calculated.",
      "It was a bloody nose and a notable defeat for the previously unassailable Tony Blair.",
      "The BBC News website has an archive of reports from this election, a time capsule of the way politics used to be.",
      "It reported that Dobson's \"humiliation in the mayoral poll was underlined as he came fourth in the mayoral contest in Barnet and Camden - the seat which includes his parliamentary constituency\".",
      "The 2000 election reports reveal Livingstone said he would \"fight for the interests of Londoners as mayor, demanding more money from the government and telling ministers they were wrong over plans to partially privatise the London Underground\".",
      "London Underground, now part of Transport for London, remains in public hands under the control of the Mayor of London.",
      "It also reported that Blair \"made it clear Mr Livingstone would not be allowed to return to Labour after standing against an official party candidate\".",
      "Blair was wrong about that: in 2004 Livingstone was the Labour candidate, and he won, again defeating Norris.",
      "Livingstone was his party's standard bearer again in both 2008 and 2012, on both occasions losing to a young Conservative contender called Boris Johnson.",

      "The tiny grains of dust are now locked inside a safe in a high security facility in Milton Keynes - we were given the first look at them.",
      "Professor Mahesh Anand is the only scientist in the UK to have been loaned this extremely rare material, which he describes as \"more precious than gold dust\".",
      "\"Nobody in the world had access to China's samples, so this is a great honour and a huge privilege,\" he says.",
      "After grinding and zapping the dust with lasers, Prof Anand's team hope to answer fundamental questions about how the Moon formed and about the early years of planet Earth.",
      "Inside the grains of dust could be evidence to back up scientists' theory that the Moon was made from the debris thrown out when Earth struck a Mars-sized planet 4.5 billion years ago.",
      "China collected the rocks on its Chang'e 5 space mission in 2020 when it landed on a volcanic area called Mons R\u00fcmker.",
      "A robotic arm drilled into the soil to collect 2kg of material, which was brought back to Earth in a capsule which landed in Inner Mongolia.",
      "It was the first successful lunar sampling since a Soviet mission in 1976 and catapulted China into a leading position in the new space race.",
      "Now, following a long tradition of global collaboration between space scientists, China has for the first time granted seven international researchers access to the samples to allow them to make new discoveries.",
      "The tiny vials were handed to Prof Anand at a glamorous ceremony in Beijing last week, where he met colleagues from Russia, Japan, Pakistan and Europe.",
      "\"It was almost like a parallel universe - and China is so far ahead of us in terms of their investment in space programmes,\" he said.",

      "The environment inside this high security room must be spotless to prevent contamination.",
      "If Earthly material mixes with these extra-terrestrial specks, it could permanently ruin the analysis Prof Anand's team will do.",
      "We crouch down on the floor in front of a row of safes. Prof Anand unlocks one and carefully pulls out a ziplock bag with three containers the size of boxes that could keep a necklace.",
      "Wedged firmly in each one is a see-through vial with a dusting of dark grey at the bottom.",
      "That is the Moon dust.",
      "It looks underwhelming, but it is humbling to think of its cosmic journey.",
      "And Prof Anand says they don't need any more than this 60mg in total.",
      "\"Here, the small is mighty. Believe me, it is enough to keep us busy for years to come because we specialise in working on the micro,\" he adds.",

      "She's been cutting and grinding pieces of rocks for 36 years, but this will be the first time she's worked on something straight from the lunar surface.",
      "\"I'm extremely excited,\" she says, after showing us how she cuts meteorites using a diamond blade.",
      "\"But I'm nervous - there's not much of the samples and they can't really go and get more very easily. This is high stakes,\" she adds.",
      "After she prepares the samples, they will go into two more labs.",
      "In one, we see a machine with an intricate network of countless tubes, valves and wires.",
      "Technician Sasha Verchovsky has been building it since the early 1990s. He shows us the small cylinder where the specs of dust can be heated to 1400C. That will help them extract carbon, nitrogen and noble gases.",

      "\"It's going to start to glow, and you will see it melt inwards,\" he says.",
      "The team has a year to finish their research. By the end, their search for answers will probably end up destroying the samples.",
      "But China has gone further since the Chang'e 5 mission.",
      "In 2024 its Chang'e 6 launch brought back the first samples from the far side of the Moon. It's a deeply mysterious place that might have evidence of long-quiet volcanic lava flows.",
      "\"I very much hope that this is the beginning of a long-term collaboration between China and international scientists,\" says Prof Anand.",

      "Despite declaring \"a litter emergency\" in 2022, Keep Scotland Beautiful also warned that litter levels continued to rise.",
      "In Wales, the problem was found to be worst in towns and cities - with more than 35% of urban areas seeing \"unacceptable\" levels of litter.",
      "There was also a 286% increase in the number of the most dirty streets, graded \"D\" for cleanliness.",

      "'Heart-breaking'",
      "Fellow Splott resident Lynne Thomas, who organises monthly volunteer litter picks, said much of the litter was caused by people incorrectly putting their bins out.",
      "\"The seagulls are getting savvy - if there's any food elements in any of the bags they're there in seconds - they will have it, they will shred it and strew it across the streets,\" she said.",

      "There is much we don't know about the re-entry, including where it might land, but if any of it does survive, 70% of Earth is covered by sea so it is unlikely to cause significant damage.",
      "\"It's much more likely that you win the lottery than that you get impacted by this piece of space debris.\" said Mr Stijn Lemmens, Senior Space Debris Mitigation Analyst at the European Space Agency.",
      "The lander capsule is a tough, spherical object about a metre wide and weighs nearly half a tonne.",
      "It was built to survive the extreme heat and pressure of Venus's atmosphere, meaning it has a robust heat shield and durable structure.",
      "This is why experts think it may survive an uncontrolled descent through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "The parachute system, originally intended to slow the lander's descent towards Venus, is likely long since degraded after more than 50 years in space.",
      "The risk to people on the ground is considered low, but the capsule's projected flight path could see it land anywhere between 51.7\u00b0 north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world.",
      "This means it could potentially land anywhere from as far north as London to as far south as the southern tip of South America.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 May 2025 20:13:28 GMT",
    "summary": "Sir David says his new film Ocean is one of the most important of his career.",
    "story": [
      "Sir David Attenborough is launching what he says is one of the most important films of his career as he enters his hundredth year.",
      "He believes his new, cinema-length film Ocean could play a decisive role in saving biodiversity and protecting the planet from climate change.",
      "Sir David, who will be 99 on Thursday, says: \"After almost 100 years on the planet, I now understand the most important place on Earth is not on land, but at sea.\"",
      "The ocean is the planet's support system and humanity's greatest ally against climate catastrophe, the film argues. It shows how the world's oceans are at a crossroads.",
      "The blue carpet was rolled out for the premiere the Royal Festival Hall in London.",
      "In attendance was the King, told Sir David he \"can't believe\" his 99th birthday was on Thursday.",
      "The pair posed for photos before they entered the auditorium for the screening.",
      "A host of celebrities also attended, including singer Geri Halliwell-Horner, astronaut Tim Peake, singer James Blunt and model Cara Delevingne.",
      "Earlier, Prince William attended a matinee in a \"private capacity\", along with hundreds of children from schools across the country.",
      "Toby Nowlan, who produced Ocean, says this new production is not a typical Attenborough film. \"This is not about seeing brand new natural history behaviours.  It is the greatest message he's ever told,\" he says.",
      "The film documents how the state of the world's oceans and our understanding of how they function have changed in the course of Sir David's lifetime.",
      "Sir David remembers his first scuba dive on the Great Barrier Reef way back in 1957:  \"I was so taken aback by the spectacle before me I forgot \u2013 momentarily \u2013 to breathe.\"",
      "Since then, there has been a catastrophic decline in life in the world's oceans.  \"We are almost out of time,\" he warns.",
      "Ocean contains some of the most graphic footage of the damage that bottom trawling \u2013 a common fishing practice around the world - can do to the seabed. It is a vivid example of how industrial fishing can drain the life from the world's oceans, Sir David claims.",
      "The new footage shows how the chain that the trawlers drag behind them scours the seafloor, forcing the creatures it disturbs into the net behind. They are often seeking a single species: more than three-quarters of what they catch may be discarded.",
      "\"It's hard to imagine a more wasteful way to catch fish,\" comments Sir David.",
      "The process also releases vast amounts of carbon dioxide which contributes to the warming of our planet, yet bottom trawling is not just legal but is actively encouraged by many governments.",
      "Sir David says the state of the ocean has almost made him lose hope for the future of life on the planet. What has kept him from despair is what he calls the \"most remarkable discovery of all\" \u2013 that the ocean can \"recover faster than we had ever imagined\".",
      "Sir David says the story of the world's whales has been a source of huge optimism for him.",
      "It is estimated that 2.9 million whales were killed by the whaling industry in the 20th Century alone. Scientists have said it is the largest cull of any animal in history when measured in terms of total biomass. It pushed almost all whale species to the edge of extinction.",
      "Just one per cent of Blue Whales were left, recalls Sir David: \"I remember thinking that was it. There was no coming back, we had lost the great whales.\"",
      "But in 1986 lawmakers bowed to public pressure and banned commercial whaling worldwide. The whale population has rapidly recovered since then.",
      "One of the film's directors, Keith Scholey, has worked with Sir David for 44 years.  \"When I first met David, I was in shorts,\" he jokes. That was in 1981, two years after Sir David had resigned as the BBC's director of programmes \u2013 one of the most senior jobs at the Corporation. \"He'd done one career, and he was off on his next.\"",
      "Despite now nearing his 99th birthday Sir David is still remarkably energetic, says Scholey. \"Every time you work with David, you learn something new,\" he says.  \"It's really good fun. But also, David keeps you on your mettle, because he is so on his mettle and so, you know, it's always a very creative process.\"",
      "Sir David's key message in the Ocean film is that all is not lost.  Countries have promised to protect a third of the world's oceans.  He hopes his new film will spur leaders to take firm action on this promise at a UN conference next month.",
      "He believes that could be transformational.",
      "\"The ocean can bounce back to life,\" Sir David says. \"If left alone it may not just recover but thrive beyond anything anyone alive has ever seen.\"",
      "A healthier ocean ecosystem would also be able to trap more carbon dioxide, helping protect the world from climate change, according to scientists.",
      "\"In front of us is a chance to protect our climate, our food, our home,\" Sir David says.",
      "As he celebrates his 99th birthday this week he is still fighting to protect the natural world he has worked his lifetime to show to us in all its glory.",

      "Those designated \"Category 1\" - the highest level - will face additional duties to keep users safe.",
      "In very simple terms, sites are most likely to be classed as Category 1 if they allow millions of UK users to interact and share content with each other, and have systems that recommend content.",

    "story": [
      "Apple is asking an appeals court to pause a US district judge's recent ruling in a case which could determine the future of its highly lucrative App Store.",
      "Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found last week the tech giant wilfully violated an order she had previously made in a case filed by Fortnite-maker Epic Games.",
      "That order - handed down in 2021 - demanded Apple refrain from anti-competitive conduct and pricing and allow outside payment options in the App Store.",
      "Last week she determined Apple was flouting that demand - a finding Apple has now called \"extraordinary.\"",
      "The iPhone maker has alleged in a court filing that her order unlawfully prevents the company from controlling \"core aspects of its business operations.\"",
      "\"A federal court cannot force Apple to permanently give away free access to its products and services, including intellectual property,\" the company's lawyers wrote.",
      "Case origins",
      "Both of Judge Gonzalez Rogers' judgements stem from an antitrust case filed by Epic Games.",
      "In 2020, Epic accused the iPhone-maker of possessing an illegal monopoly with its App Store, which collected commissions of between 15% and 30% on in-app purchases.",
      "The judge rejected Epic's monopoly claims, but found Apple was stopping developers from giving users alternative payment options in violation of California competition rules.",
      "She ordered Apple to make changes that would help developers steer customers to cheaper payment options outside of the Apple ecosystem.",
      "Last year, Epic accused Apple of failing to comply by creating a new set of fees for developers instead.",
      "In a contempt order last week, Judge Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple continued to interfere with competition, saying that internal company documents showed Apple deliberately violated her 2021 injunction.",
      "'Substantial sums'",
      "On Wednesday, Apple requested an appeals court take action, including by lifting a ban that stops it from charging developers fees on purchases made outside the App Store.",
      "The company wrote that such restrictions \"will cost Apple substantial sums annually\" and are based on conduct that has not been found unlawful.",
      "\"Rather, they were imposed to punish Apple for purported non-compliance with an earlier state-law Injunction that is itself invalid,\" Apple wrote.",
      "In response, Epic Games said Judge Gonzalez Rogers' contempt order last week was already benefitting consumers.",
      "\"Apple has faced a surge of genuine competition as developers have updated their apps with better payment methods, better deals, and better consumer choice,\" Epic wrote in a post on the social media platform X.",
      "The company criticized Apple's motion as \"a last ditch effort to block competition and extract massive junk fees at the expense of consumers and developers.\"",
      "Epic says it is on track with plans to bring Fortnite back to iPhones and iPads.",
      "Apple removed Fortnite from its App Store in 2020 after Epic unveiled an in-app payment system into the game.",
      "The move led to the current court battle between the two companies.",
      "Apple did not directly addresses Judge Gonzalez Rogers' stunning rebuke of company executives in its court filing.",
      "In her most recent order, she said CEO Tim Cook ignored executive Phillip Schiller's urging to have Apple comply with her injunction, and allowed then-Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri to convince him not to.",
      "\"Cook chose poorly,\" she wrote.",
      "The company documents she reviewed reveal \"that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option\", she wrote.",
      "Judge Gonzalez Rogers said she would refer the matter to the US Attorney for Northern District of California to investigate if a criminal contempt proceeding against Apple is appropriate.",
      "Apple said last week it would comply with the court's order while it appeals.",

      "While some experts argue the unique use of AI is just another step into the future, others say it could become a slippery slope for using the technology in legal cases.",
      "His family used voice recordings, videos and pictures of Mr Pelkey, who was 37 when he was killed, to recreate him in a video using AI, his sister Stacey Wales told the BBC.",
      "Ms Wales said she wrote the words that the AI version read in court based on how forgiving she knew her brother to be.",
      "\"To Gabriel Horcasitas, the man who shot me, it is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" said the AI version of Mr Pelkey in court. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends.\"",
      "\"I believe in forgiveness, and a God who forgives. I always have and I still do,\" the AI verison of Mr Pelkey - wearing a grey baseball cap - continues.",
      "The technology was used at his killer's sentencing - Horcasitas already had been found guilty by a jury - some four years after Horcasitas shot Mr Pelkey at a red light in Arizona.",
      "The Arizona judge who oversaw the case, Todd Lang, seemed to appreciate the use of AI at the hearing. He sentenced Horcasitas to 10-and-a-half years in prison on manslaughter charges.",
      "\"I loved that AI, thank you for that. As angry as you are, as justifiably angry as the family is, I heard the forgiveness,\" Judge Lang said. \"I feel that that was genuine.\"",
      "Paul Grimm, a retired federal judge and Duke Law School professor, told the BBC he was not surprised to see AI used in the Horcasitas sentencing.",
      "Arizona courts, he notes, already have started using AI in other ways. When the state's Supreme Court issues a ruling, for example, it has an AI system that makes those rulings digestible for people.",
      "And Mr Grimm said because it was used without a jury present, just for a judge to decide sentencing, the technology was allowed.",
      "\"We'll be leaning [AI] on a case-by-case basis, but the technology is irresistible,\" he said.",
      "But some experts like Derek Leben, a business ethics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, are concerned about the use of AI and the precedent this case sets.",
      "While Mr Leben does not question this family's intention or actions, he worries not all uses of AI will be consistent with a victim's wishes.",
      "\"If we have other people doing this moving forward, are we always going to get fidelity to what the person, the victim in this case, would've wanted?\" Mr Leben asked.",
      "For Ms Wales, however, this gave her brother the final word.",
      "\"We approached this with ethics and morals because this is a powerful tool. Just like a hammer can be used to break a window or rip down a wall, it can also be used as a tool to build a house and that's how we used this technology,\" she said."

      "\"This is a place to make sure that information survives technology obsolescence, time and ageing. That's our mission,\" says founder Rune Bjerkestrand, leading the way inside.",
      "Switching on head-torches we descended a dark passageway and followed the old rail tracks 300 metres into the mountainside, until we reached the archive's metal door.",
      "Inside the vault, stands a shipping container stacked with silver packets, each containing reels of film, on which the data is stored.",
      "\"It's a lot of memories, a lot of heritage,\" Mr Bjerkestrand says.",
      "\"It's anything from digitised art pieces, literature, music, motion picture, you name it.\"",
      "Since the archive's launch eight years ago, more than 100 deposits have been made by institutions, companies and individuals, from 30-plus countries.",
      "Among the many digitised artefacts are 3D scans and models of the Taj Mahal; tranches of ancient manuscripts from the Vatican Library; satellite observations of Earth from space; and Norway's treasured painting, the Scream, by Edvard Munck.",
      "The AWA is a commercial operation and relies on technology provided by Norwegian data preservation company, Piql, which Mr Bjerkestrand also heads.",
      "It was inspired by the Global Seed Vault, a seed bank that's located only a few hundred metres away, a repository where crops can be recovered after natural or manmade disasters.",

      "Once these images are exposed and developed, the processed film appears grey, but viewed more closely, it's similar to a mass of tiny QR codes.",
      "The information can't be deleted or changed, and is easily retrievable explains Mr Mantsev.",
      "\"We can scan it back, and decode the data just the same way as reading data from a hard drive, but we will be reading data from the film.\"",
      "One key question arising with long-term storage methods, is whether people will understand what has been preserved and how to recover it, centuries into the future.",
      "That's a scenario Piql has also thought about, and so a guide that can be magnified and read optically, is printed onto the film, as well.",
      "Every day more data is being used and generated than ever before, but experts have long warned of a potential \"digital Dark Age\", as technological advances render previous software and hardware obsolete.",

      "The US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which leads and coordinates US Catholic activities, celebrated Pope Leo's election and the message it sends.",
      "\"Certainly, we rejoice that a son of this nation has been chosen by the cardinals, but we recognise that he now belongs to all Catholics and to all people of good will,\" the conference said in a statement. \"His words advocating peace, unity, and missionary activity already indicate a path forward.\"",

      "The full picture of what led to Pope Leo's selection on Thursday is still emerging and church decisions don't map neatly onto US politics. Still, watchers around the world have pored over Pope Leo's social media profiles in search of clues about his leanings and beliefs.",

      "Taylor Swift's representatives have told the BBC she is being brought into a legal row between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively to create \"tabloid clickbait\".",
      "The 35-year-old singer was summoned to a US court after it was alleged she encouraged Baldoni to accept script re-writes by Lively for It Ends With Us, a film that both starred in and is the centre of a sexual harassment case.",
      "Baldoni says he was invited to Lively's New York home in 2023 to discuss script changes, where Lively's husband, Ryan Reynolds, and Swift were there to serve as her \"dragons\".",
      "Representatives for Swift said \"she was not involved in any casting or creative decision\" and \"never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\".",
      "Lively, 37, sued Baldoni, 41, in December 2024, accusing him of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Baldoni is counter-suing Lively and her husband, the actor Ryan Reynolds, on claims of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "Lively and Baldoni have been locked in a dispute since the film, which is an adaption of a Colleen Hoover novel, was released last summer.",
      "According to Baldoni, there were tensions over the 2023 re-write of the scene, at which he was surprised to find Reynolds and Swift present.",
      "He alleges Lively wrote in a text to him: \"If you ever get around to watching Game of Thrones, you'll appreciate that I'm Khaleesi, and like her, I happen to have a few dragons. For better or worse, but usually better. Because my dragons also protect those I fight for.\"",
      "Baldoni says he responded supportively, writing: \"I really love what you did. It really does help a lot. Makes it so much more fun and interesting. (And I would have felt that way without Ryan and Taylor).",
      "\"You really are a talent across the board. Really excited and grateful to do this together.\"",
      "It is also alleged that Swift was involved in the casting of Isabela Ferrer in the film, who played a younger version of Lively's character, Lily Bloom.",
      "Speaking at the New York premiere of It Ends With Us, Ferrer said: \"She [Taylor Swift] was a helpful part of the audition, which I found out later when I got it, and that rocked my world.\"",
      "But Swift's representatives said the only involvement she had in the film was permitting the use of her song, My Tears Ricochet, noting that she was among 20 artists featured in the film.",
      "Swift \"never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, [and] she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film\", they said.",

      "He was met by a jubilant group of staff and former colleagues, all eager to shake his hand and congratulate him.",

      "But details on how Pope Leo will be looking to run the Catholic Church are still scarce, and so over the next few days and weeks every small clue \u2013 from his attire to his choice of accommodation \u2013 will be examined.",
      "Scrutiny began as soon as he stepped on to the balcony, giving the crowd a glimpse of the vestments he chose for his first appearance.",
      "The gold cross around his neck that caught the evening light was seen as a first sign he was departing from the simplicity of his predecessor's simple silver pendant; the embroidered stole and red mozzetta cemented that impression.",
      "Then, the fact that the homily he delivered to cardinals in the Sistine Chapel on Friday morning was scripted \u2013 rather than improvised \u2013  also sent a signal that \"Leo will be more closely aligned to tradition than Francis was,\" said Austen Ivereigh, a Catholic writer and commentator.",
      "But several events over the next few days and weeks will give Pope Leo a further chance to sketch out the priorities of his pontificate.",
      "On Monday he is due to hold an audience with the media and on 18 May he will celebrate a solemn inaugural mass in St Peter's Square.",
      "As part of that mass he will deliver a homily in the presence of numerous heads of state and dignitaries.",
      "In his 2013 inaugural homily, Pope Francis asked \"all those who have positions of responsibility in economic, political and social life\" to be \"protectors of creation, of God's plan\u2026 of one another and of the environment\".",

      "\"These are all important choices,\" Ivereigh added.",

      "US ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee said \"distribution centres\" protected by security contractors would provide food and other supplies to over a million people initially, as part of an effort to prevent Hamas stealing aid.",
      "He denied Israel would take part in aid delivery or distribution, but said its forces would secure the centres' perimeters.",

      "He added: \"There is no reason to put in place a system that is at odds with the DNA of any principled humanitarian organisation.\"",
      "Since early March, Israel has cut off all supplies from reaching Gaza - including food, shelters, medicines and fuel - leading to a humanitarian crisis for its 2.1 million residents.",
      "A third of the community kitchens in Gaza - one of the territory's last remaining lifelines - have been forced to shut down over the past two weeks due to shortages of food and fuel, according to OCHA.",
      "Among them were the last two field kitchens of World Central Kitchen, a US-based charity which had been providing 133,000 meals daily before it ran out of ingredients on Tuesday.",
      "Prices of basic foodstuffs have also skyrocketed at local markets, with a 25kg (55lb) bag of flour now selling for $415 (\u00a3313) in Gaza City - a 30-fold increase compared to the end of February, OCHA says.",
      "Huckabee told journalists in Jerusalem that US President Donald Trump saw aid for Gaza as an urgent matter and that his team was tasked \"to do everything possible to accelerate that and to as expeditiously as possible get humanitarian aid into the people\".",
      "Israel and the US accuse Hamas of diverting aid. \"Previous actions have often been met with Hamas stealing the food that was intended for hungry people,\" the ambassador said.",
      "The UN and other agencies say they have strong supervisory mechanisms and that when aid has surged into Gaza, incidents of looting have largely halted. The World Health Organization says none of its medical supplies have been looted during the war.",
      "The Trump administration is trying to build momentum behind the new aid initiative ahead of the president's trip next week to wealthy Arab Gulf countries that could help to fund it.",
      "It says that a non-governmental organisation has been set up and that aid delivery will not be under Israeli military control.",
      "Huckabee said: \"The Israelis are going to be involved in providing necessary security because this is a war zone. But they will not be involved in the distribution of the food, or even the bringing of food into Gaza.\"",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked on Friday whether the plan would \"militarise\" aid distribution in the region.",
      "\"I would reject that characterisation,\" she responded.",
      "The newly registered Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) appears to have been set up for this purpose.",
      "A 14-page document from GHF, seen by the BBC, promises to set up four distribution sites, giving out food, water and hygiene kits initially for 1.2 million people - less than 60% of the population. It says the project aims to reach all Gazans eventually.",
      "Aimed at potential donors, the paper states that \"months of conflict have collapsed traditional relief channels in Gaza\".",
      "It goes on: \"GHF was established to restore that vital lifeline through an independent, rigorously-audited model that gets assistance directly - and only - to those in need.\"",
      "The document maintains that GHF is \"guided by the humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence\".",
      "Its boards of directors and advisors are said to include a former chief executive of World Central Kitchen, along with the American former head of the UN's World Food Programme, David Beasley - though his participation is not yet confirmed.",
      "Full details of how the aid mechanism will work on the ground are not given.",
      "The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Some 59 are still held captive, up to 24 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Israel's military campaign has killed more than 52,700 people in Gaza, mostly women, children and the elderly, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "Last Sunday, Israel's security cabinet approved an intensified military offensive against Hamas in Gaza which could involve forcibly displacing the population to the south, seizing the entire territory indefinitely, and controlling aid.",
      "This was quickly met with widespread international condemnation. Many of Israel's allies pointed out that it was bound under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid.",
      "The UK's Minister for the Middle East, Hamish Falconer, told Parliament on Monday that the British government was gravely concerned that the Israeli announcements could lead to the 19-month-long war in Gaza entering \"a dangerous new phase\".",
      "On the subject of aid, he said: \"As the UN has said, it is hard to see how, if implemented, the new Israeli plan to deliver aid through private companies would be consistent with humanitarian principles and meet the scale of the need. We need urgent clarity from the Israeli government on their intentions.",
      "\"We must remember what is at stake. These humanitarian principles matter for every conflict around the world. They should be applied consistently in every war zone.\"",
      "This week, the US Special Envoy for the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, briefed members of the UN Security Council - which includes the UK - behind closed doors about the new plan to resume the delivery of aid.",
      "The Council's five European members - the UK, France, Denmark, Greece and Slovenia - have requested an urgent meeting to discuss the humanitarian situation in Gaza, likely to be scheduled for Tuesday.",
      "The UK delegation said Israel's blockade was \"inexcusable\", adding that the only way to end the suffering of both Palestinians and Israelis was to return to a ceasefire, secure the release of all hostages and \"surge\" aid into Gaza.",
      "Meanwhile, Israeli media reported that Israeli forces were already setting up distribution hubs in Rafah, in southern Gaza, in \"a sterile zone\" designed to be free of any Hamas presence.",
      "According to reports, Israel expects that aid will be distributed to security-screened representatives from each Gazan family who would be allowed to take supplies for his or her relatives only. They would be allowed into the hubs only on foot.",
      "The Israeli defence establishment was said to have assessed that the average quantity of aid that would have to be distributed as 70kg (154lb) per family per week.",
      "The Israeli military would ultimately be stationed outside the distribution hubs, allowing aid workers to hand out food without soldiers being directly involved, the reports say.",
      "Israel and the US argue that the new system would prevent Hamas from being able to steal food for its own benefit. By preventing its access to aid and involvement in security for convoys, they hope to reduce the group's influence over the Gazan population.",
      "However, there are major questions over the plan's feasibility. The current UN system uses some 400 points of aid distribution, while the situation in Gaza is now at a crisis point, with warnings that mass starvation is imminent.",
      "At a UN briefing in Geneva, aid officials said they had carried out \"careful analysis\" before deciding they could not participate in the US-Israeli scheme. They said they had not been formally presented with the GHF document that is currently circulating.",
      "James Elder, spokesman for the UN's children's agency Unicef, said the plan that had been laid out would lead to more children suffering, not fewer. He noted that civilians would have to travel to militarised zones to receive aid, meaning the most vulnerable - children and the elderly - would struggle to get there.",
      "He said the decision to locate all the distribution points in the south appeared designed to use aid as \"a bait\" to forcibly displace Gazans once again. The UN says 90% of the population has been displaced during the war, often many times.",
      "The plan that has been discussed with UN agencies envisages just 60 lorry loads of aid entering each day - far less than they say is needed to meet growing needs, and a tenth of the number that went in daily during the recent two-month ceasefire.",
      "OCHA's Jens Laerke said that in short, the proposals from Israel \"do not meet the minimum bar for principled humanitarian support\".",
      "Analysts say that the current impasse over aid for Gaza is not only an existential threat to the UN's vast humanitarian operation in the Palestinian territory but could also have implications for its future work.",
      "If it was to agree to a scheme accommodating the demands of the military on one side in a conflict, it could dent perceptions of the UN's neutrality and impartiality, and set a dangerous precedent leading to similar demands in other war zones where it operates.",
      "The UN and other aid agencies also point out that they currently have tonnes of supplies piled up near Gaza's border crossings, ready to enter, if Israel would allow it.",
      "Without an end to the blockade, the risk of famine is expected to grow.",
      "In Jabalia, in northern Gaza, which has already been the focus of Israeli military operations against Hamas, Palestinian families told the BBC of their growing despair as they waited for a food handout at a takia, or community kitchen, which turned into a chaotic scramble.",
      "\"Every day I come here and wait with my cooking pot to feed my children,\" Umm Ahmed said. \"The pot doesn't fill us up. We have been suffering for two months. There's no flour or anything. Open the borders so we can eat properly.\"",
      "She said she would not comply with Israeli efforts to force her to move south to Rafah to receive aid.",
      "\"We don't have money for transport, we don't have money to eat!\" she exclaimed. \"I don't want to evacuate from here, I'd rather die than leave.\"",
      "\"The takia is our last source of food,\" said Mohammed, who had been waiting for five hours in line. \"My wife is pregnant and sick, and I'm unable to get her to the hospital. How am I supposed to get to Rafah?\"",

      "Wedged firmly in each one is a see-through vial with a dusting of dark grey at the bottom.",

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g2j45d5zeo",
    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 04:01:38 GMT",
    "summary": "How consumers are reacting to shipping changes that mean low-value packages entering the US no longer avoid tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Earlier this year, Deborah Grushkin, an enthusiastic online shopper from New Jersey, \"freaked out\".",
      "US President Donald Trump had signed an order to stop allowing packages from China worth less than $800 (\u00a3601) to enter the country free of import taxes and customs procedures.",
      "It was a move, backed by traditional retailers, that had been discussed in Washington for years amid an explosion of packages slipping into the US under the limit.",
      "Many countries, including the UK, are considering similar measures, spurred in part by the rapid ascent of Shein and Temu.",
      "But in the US, Trump's decision to end the carve-out while ordering a blitz of new trade tariffs, including import taxes of at least 145% on goods from China, has delivered a one-two punch that has left businesses and shoppers reeling.",
      "US-based e-commerce brands, which were set up around the system, are warning the changes could spark failures of smaller firms, while shoppers like Deborah brace for price hikes and shortages.",
      "With the 2 May deadline bearing down, the 36-year-old last month rushed in some $400 worth of items from Shein - including stickers, T-shirts, sweatshirts, Mother's Days gifts and 20 tubes of liquid eyeliner.",
      "\"I felt like maybe it was my last sort of hurrah,\" she says.",
      "Use of rules known as \"de minimis\", which allow low-value packages to avoid tariffs, customs inspections and other regulatory requirements, has surged over the last decade.",
      "Take-up accelerated during Trump's first term in office, when he raised tariffs on many Chinese goods.",
      "By 2023, such shipments represented more than 7% of consumer imports, up from less than 0.01% a decade earlier. Last year, nearly 1.4 billion packages entered the country using the exemption - more than 3.7 million a day.",
      "Advocates of the carve-out, which include shipping firms, say the system has streamlined trade, leading to lower prices and more options for customers.",
      "Those in favour of change, a group that includes lawmakers from both parties, say businesses are abusing rules intended to ease gifts between family and friends, and the rise has made it easier to slip products that are illegal, counterfeit or violate safety standards and other rules into the country.",
      "Trump recently called de minimis a \"scam\", brushing off concerns about higher costs. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said.",
      "However, polls suggest concerns about his economic policies are rising as the changes start to hit home.",
      "Krystal DuFrene, a retired 57-year-old from Mississippi who relies on disability payments for her income, says she has nervously been checking prices on Temu for weeks, recently cancelling an order for curtains after seeing the price more than triple.",
      "Though she eventually found the same item for the original price in the platform's US warehouse network, she says the cost of her husband's fishing nets had more than doubled.",
      "\"I don't know who pays the tariff except the customer,\" she says. \"Everywhere is selling cheap stuff from China so I actually prefer being able to order directly.\"",
      "When the rules around de minimis changed last week, Temu said it would stop selling goods imported from China in the US directly to customers from its platform, and that all sales would now be handled by \"locally based sellers\", with orders fulfilled from within the US.",
      "'End of an era'",
      "Even without the latest tariffs, economists Pablo Fajgelbaum and Amit Khandelwal had estimated that ending de minimis would lead to at least $10.9bn in new costs, which they found would be disproportionately borne by lower income and minority households.",
      "\"It does kind of feel like the end of an era,\" says Gee Davis, a 40-year-old author from Missouri, who used Temu during a recent house move to buy small items such as an electric can opener and kitchen cabinet organisers.",
      "She says it was a relief to be able to easily afford the extras and the new rules felt like a \"money grab\" by the government to benefit big, entrenched American retailers like Amazon and Walmart that sell similar products - but at a bigger mark-up.",
      "\"I don't think it's right or fair that little treats should be [restricted] to people who are richer.",
      "\"It just would be a real bummer if everyone who was under a certain household income threshold was just no longer able to afford anything for themselves.\"",
      "As with other Trump policy changes, questions remain about the significance of the shift.",
      "The president was already forced to suspend the policy once before, as packages began piling up at the border.",
      "Lori Wallach, director at Rethink Trade, which supports ending de minimis for consumer safety reasons, says the end of the exemption is significant \"on paper\", but she fears the administration is taking steps that will weaken its implementation.",
      "She points to a recent customs notice, which said products affected by many of the new tariffs could enter the country through the informal process, a move that eases some regulatory requirements.",
      "\"Practically, because all of this stuff can come though informal entry, it's going to be extremely hard to collect tariffs or to be able to inspect really very much more than before the change happened,\" she says.",
      "'An insurmountable shift'",
      "Customs and Border Protection deny the move will undermine enforcement, noting that firms are still required to supply more information than before.",
      "Businesses have indicated they are taking the changes seriously.",
      "Both Shein and Temu last month warned customers that prices would rise, while Temu says it is rapidly expanding its network of US-based sellers and warehouses to protect its low prices.",
      "Other business groups say many smaller, less high-profile American brands that manufacture abroad for US customers are struggling - and may not survive.",
      "\"If the tariffs weren't in place, it would be like taking a little bit of bitter medicine,\" says Alex Beller, board member of the Ecommerce Innovation Alliance, a business lobby group and a co-founder of Postscript, which works with thousands of smaller businesses on text messaging marketing.",
      "\"But paired with the other tariffs, especially for brands that manufacture in China, it just becomes an insurmountable shift.\"",
      "In a letter to the government last month, men's clothing company Indochino, known for its custom suits made-to-order in China, warned that ending de minimis posed a \"significant threat to the viability\" of its business and other mid-size American firms like it.",
      "Steven Borelli is the chief executive of the athleisure clothing firm CUTS, which manufactures outside the US, shipping products to a warehouse in Mexico, from where packages are mailed to customers in the US.",
      "His firm has been pushing to reduce its reliance on China, halting orders in the country months ago. Still, he says he is now considering price increases and job cuts.",
      "He says his business has room to manoeuvre, since it caters to higher income customers, but he expects \"thousands\" of other brands to die without changes to the situation.",
      "\"We want more time,\" he says. \"The speed at which everything is happening is too fast for businesses to adjust.\""

    "summary": "With just a week to go, here's our guide to the songs and artists taking part in Eurovision 2025.",
    "story": [
      "The 2025 Eurovision Song Contest pops its cork on Sunday, with a \"turquoise carpet\" parade featuring competitors from all 37 nations.",
      "But the competition really begins on Tuesday, when the first semi-final will see five countries unceremoniously kicked out.",
      "Another six will lose their place at the second semi-final on Thursday, before the Grand Final takes place in Basel, Switzerland, on Saturday, 17 May.",
      "This year's entrants include two returning contestants, one professional opera singer, a thinly veiled allusion to sexual emissions and a dance anthem about a dead space dog.",
      "It's a lot to take in.",
      "To help you prepare, here's a guide to all 37 songs in the contest, which I've sorted into rough musical categories, mainly for my own sanity (it didn't work).",
      "Left-field pop bangers",
      "Win or lose, UK contestants Remember Monday have given headline writers a gift with the title of their entry: What The Hell Just Happened?",
      "A souped-up, full throttle pop anthem, it cherry-picks the best bits of Queen, Andrew Lloyd Webber and the Beatles, presumably to remind voters of Britain's rich musical heritage.",
      "With eight tempo changes, it could prove tricky for voters to grasp, but the band's stellar harmonies and sparkling personalities should carry them through.",
      "Crucially, the song avoids the Eurovision cliches of jackhammer dance anthems and windswept balladry \u2013 something Remember Monday have in common with this year's favourites.",
      "Sweating it out at the top are Swedish representatives KAJ, whose song Bara Bada Bastu is an ode to the restorative powers of the sauna, complete with dancers in skimpy towels.",
      "Unreasonably catchy, it's won the approval of Abba's Bjorn Ulvaeus, whose been   singing the track in his own private sauna. As you do.",
      "Stiff competition comes from Austrian singer JJ, and his operatic ballad Wasted Love.",
      "A timeworn story of unrequited love, it leans on his training as a counter-tenor, before exploding into an unexpected techno breakdown.",
      "A favourite with the bookies, the song's only Achilles heel is its similarity to last year's winner, Nemo.",
      "Distinctive in a different way is Ireland's entry, Laika Party \u2013 a 90s trance-pop anthem about a dog who was sent to space by Russia and left to die there.",
      "Singer Emmy aims for a hopeful spin on a tragic story but, despite a peppy performance, it's a bit of a downer.",
      "More palatable is Luxembourg's Laura Thorn, whose La Poup\u00e9e Monte Le Son is a callback to France Gall's 1965 winning entry, Poup\u00e9e De Cire, Poup\u00e9e De Son.",
      "Where the original was about a \"fashion doll\" operated by songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, Thorn's response is all about taking control.",
      "\"If you think a man like you can manipulate me, go back to your mum,\" she scolds. Yeouch.",
      "Other countries sucking up to Italy",
      "Rome must be blushing. This year features not one, but two, songs about the vibrant culture of Il Bel Paese.",
      "The first comes, not surprisingly, from San Marino \u2013 the independent microstate that nestles inside north-central Italy.",
      "Titled Tutta L'Italia, it celebrates everything from the county's football team and its vineyards, to the Mona Lisa (under her Italian name Gioconda).",
      "Written by Gabry Ponte \u2013 one of the brains behind Eiffel 65's Blue (Da Ba Dee) \u2013 it's a slight, but fun, mixture of dance beats, traditional accordion playing and the folk dances of Calabria.",
      "The staging could be its downfall, though, with Gabry marooned behind his DJ decks while the singers, who for some reason wish to remain anonymous, obscure their faces with masks.",
      "More memorable, but definitely more unhinged, is Estonia's Espresso Macchiato.",
      "Performed by Tommy Cash (the only Eurovision contestant to have appeared on a Charli XCX record) it's an affectionate-ish caricature of Italian stereotypes, featuring the indelible lyric: \"Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it\".",
      "Smut!",
      "I'm trying to give up sexual innuendo, but Eurovision is making it har... difficult.",
      "A trio of artists are trying to sneak smut past the censors, led by Malta's Miriana Conte, with a throbbing club track called Serving.",
      "In its original form, the song's chorus revolved around the phrase \"serving kant\" \u2013 the word kant being Maltese for \"singing\" and a homophone for an English term that definitely doesn't mean singing.",
      "It's a reference to a well-known phrase in the drag / ballroom world; but several countries complained it broke broadcasting guidelines, prompting a hasty re-write.",
      "If the stunt was meant to generate headlines it worked, but now that Miriana has our attention, she's not letting go.",
      "Her performance, featuring a giant disco ball pursed between two red lips, is gloriously OTT, and she has an enviable set of pipes. Too bad the song is riddled with Europop cliche.",
      "Another contestant doubling his entendres is Australia's Go-Jo, who wants us to \"take a sip\" of milkshake from his \"special cup\". Interpret that how you want but I'd be wary of hitching a lift in his ice cream van, if I were you.",
      "With a smattering of Electric Six's saucy disco funk, Milkshake Man is tasty enough to get Australia back in the finals after only achieving a semi last year.",
      "Finally, we have Finland's Erika Vikman, whose song Ich Komme is billed as a \"joyous message of pleasure, ecstasy and a state of trance\".",
      "Structured to mimic the pneumatic realities of lovemaking, it recalls iconic gay anthems such as Kylie's Your Disco Needs You and Donna Summer's Hot Stuff \u2013 and ends with Erika shooting into the sky astride a massive gold microphone that's definitely not a stand-in for a phallus.",
      "Three songs inspired by cancer",
      "Little in life is more devastating than the phrase \"I'm afraid it's cancer\".",
      "The disease will affect one in two of us and, although survival rates have dramatically improved, the impact can be devastating.",
      "This year, three separate Eurovision contestants have been touched by cancer, inspiring songs of unmatched heartbreak and reflection.",
      "French singer Louane captures it best. Her song Maman, is an intimate conversation with her mother, who died when she was just 17 years old.",
      "Over three verses, Louane describes the \"emptiness\" she was felt; and how she filled the void with bad behaviour and meaningless love affairs. But, as the song progresses, she tells her mum she's settled down and found purpose... by becoming a mother herself.",
      "She sings it beautifully, with a mixture of regret and strength. And when her daughter's voice appears in the final moments of the song, it would take a steely heart not to shed a tear.",
      "Over in Norway, 19-year-old Kyle Alessandro shared a similar story, when his mother was diagnosed with cancer in autumn 2023. Thankfully, she's now in remission, but something she said during her treatment inspired his Eurovision entry: \"Never lose your light.\"",
      "Kyle took that phrase and turned it into a thumping pop song about surviving adversity. \"Nothing can burn me now,\" he sings. \"I'm my own Lighter.\"",
      "Klemen Slakonja, meanwhile, is a comedian best known in Slovenia for his impressions of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin -  but his ballad, How Much Time Do We Have Left was written after his wife, actress Mojca Fatur, was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer.",
      "As he sings, Klemen's dancers raise him into the air and hold him upside down, to represent the disorientation the family felt.",
      "\"When she read her diagnosis, our world turned upside down and I felt that rush of blood in my head, the same one I feel whenever I am upside down in the performance,\" he told Eurovision World.",
      "Defying the odds, Mojca survived, and joins him on stage at Eurovision. It's a deeply intimate and moving moment.",
      "The bops",
      "Listening to this year's line-up, it's like the contestants all heard Cascada's Evacuate the Dancefloor and went, \"Nah, we're good, thanks\".",
      "There are club bangers everywhere, with Belgium's Red Sebastian (named after the crab in The Little Mermaid, bless him) submitting an entire song about the loved-up liberation of an all-night rave.",
      "\"Where no words are needed to feel the connection / Where clocks never tick and where love is the ending.\"",
      "A favourite with fans, the 90s rave elements of Strobe Lights feel a little dated to me, but his meticulously-choreographed performance is a treat.",
      "Denmark's Sissal takes a similar sound, with a throwback Euro-bop called Hallucination that effortlessly evokes two-time Eurovision winner Loreen.",
      "Sissal said her biggest goal was for the audience to feel they couldn't sit down during the song. Mission accomplished.",
      "Germany, meanwhile, are pitching for a home run with Baller, a super-catchy trance anthem that wouldn't sound out of place at Berlin superclub Berghain.",
      "Performed by Austrian siblings Abor & Tynna, it's languishing in the middle of the field, after Tynna developed laryngitis, robbing the duo of the chance to impress fans at Eurovision's various pre-parties. But now that she's recovered, the song could rise up the rankings.",
      "That's less likely for V\u00e6b, aka the Icelandic Jedward. Their energetic dance-rap song, Ro\u00e1, is all about rowing from Iceland to the Faroe Islands, \"because no matter what happens in life you just keep on rowing through the waves\".",
      "Sadly, it's not as deep as it sounds.",
      "Spanish star Melody fares better with Esa Diva, a pumping house track with a sprinkling of flamenco guitar, that documents her journey to fame.",
      "And Azerbaijan's Mamagama go all Maroon 5 on Run With U, a smooth pop song elevated by a twinkling riff on the saz \u2013 a long-necked plucked instrument similar to the lute.",
      "Post-immigrant pop",
      "OK, so I've stolen that description from Shkodra Elektronike.",
      "They're an Albanian duo living in Italy, who fuse the ethnic music of their hometown, Shkod\u00ebr, to a progressive electronic sound.",
      "Their song Zjerm (Fire) imagines a time when cross-cultural understanding would lead to peace and harmony \u2013 a world without a need for soldiers and ambulances, and where \"oil would smell like lilac\" (no, me neither).",
      "Greece's entry, Asterom\u00e1ta, is also rooted in history and memory, as Klavdia describes the unbreakable bond that refugees share with their homeland.",
      "\"Even if they cross the seas / They shall never forget the sacred earth they called home,\" she sings, in a haunting ballad that blends traditional Greek and Pontic elements with soaring strings.",
      "Taking a more upbeat approach is Dutch singer Claude. A refugee from the bloody civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, he moved to the Netherlands at the age of nine and fell in love with Eurovision while waiting in the refugee centre.",
      "His song, C'est La Vie, is a tribute to his mum, who taught him to see the positive in their situation.",
      "Fizzing with freedom and joy, it combines elements of chanson and French-Caribbean zouk, and looks set for a top 10 placing.",
      "Witchcraft, sorcery and moody goth boys",
      "The success of \"goth gremlin witch\" Bambie Thug at last year's Eurovision has conjured a veritable coven of imitators in 2025.",
      "Polish singer Justyna Steczkowska, representing her country for the second time, even includes a Slavic magic spell in her song, Gaja \u2013 summoning the spirit of the mother Earth to \"cleanse\" her of a toxic relationship.",
      "It's a suitably intense performance, with Justyna singing long sustained notes and playing a furious violin solo, before being hoiked into the rafters on a pair ropes.",
      "What a time to be alive.",
      "Marko Bo\u0161njak, meanwhile, is cooking up a Poison Cake to feed to his tormentors - chiefly the people who bombarded him with homophobic hate messages after he was selected to represent Croatia.",
      "The criticism was so intense that he lost his voice and couldn't leave the house for five days.",
      "His song is suitably melodramatic, replete with guttural synths and creepy playground chants. It's a little overbaked, but should still sail through to the finals.",
      "Taking a more ethereal approach are Latvian group Tautumeitas, whose song Bur Man Laimi translates as \"a chant for happiness\".",
      "Reminiscent of Bjork and Enya, its overlapping folk harmonies are based on traditional Latvian wedding songs, making it one of this year's most captivating entries. I fear it may be too subtle to score well, though.",
      "Further mystery is provided by, Theo Evan, Cyprus's answer to Nick Jonas. The lyrics to his song, Shh, are a riddle, written by former tennis player Elke Tiel, whose \"hidden truth will only be revealed on the Eurovision stage in May\".",
      "He opens his performance perched between two pieces of scaffolding in a recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's famous Vitruvian Man sketch \u2013 so there's a clue.",
      "Shh is one of a number of gothic pop songs, sung by brooding young men with interesting hair.",
      "Among the best is Kiss Kiss Goodbye, by Czechia's Adonxs, who divebombs from an angelic falsetto to an unsettling baritone as he confronts his absent father.",
      "Lithuanian band Katarsis are an interesting experiment, with a deliberately downbeat rock song that declares \"the foundations of everything have begun to rot\".",
      "Titled Tavo Akys (your eyes), it builds to a compelling climax, but it's hard to see it being a vote-winner, unless Eurovision suddenly attracts an audience of depressed emo teens.",
      "Rounding out the field are Armenian singer Parg, with the Imagine Dragons-inspired Survivor and Serbia's Princ, whose overwrought ballad is called Mila.",
      "Both performers give it their all, but the songs don't feel strong enough to survive the semi-finals.",
      "70s rock throwbacks",
      "Four years after M\u00e5neskin's victory, Eurovision's rock revival continues apace.",
      "Italy are back at it again, thanks to Lucio Corsi \u2013 think David Bowie as Pierrot \u2013 and his glam rock ballad Volevo Essere Un Duro (I wanted to be tough).",
      "A delicate anthem for people who feel they don't fit in, it recalls how Lucio was bullied as a kid, and how he's  grown to embrace his fragility. At one point, he sings: \"Instead of a star, [I'm] just a sneeze.\"",
      "It's a timeless bit of songwriting that pulls off that crucial Eurovision trick of sounding new and familiar all at once.",
      "Portuguese indie band Napa also have a 70s vibe, channelling Paul McCartney's Wings on the soft rock tear-jerker Deslocado (out of place).",
      "It's another song about migration, written after the band were forced to relocate from Madeira to the Portuguese mainland due to the economic crisis.",
      "\"Even though we've been here for a few years we always have that desire to go back, and that anguish of saying goodbye to family,\" said singer Guilherme Gomes.",
      "Last but not least are Ukraine's Ziferblat, who continue the country's astonishing run of high-quality entries in the midst of a war with Russia.",
      "Their song, Bird Of Pray, is an unexpected mix of 70s new wave band Cars, birdsong and the guitar riff from Rachel Stevens' Sweet Dreams My LA Ex \u2013 while the lyrics are full of hope for a peaceful reunion with their loved ones.",
      "It's better than that makes it sound.",
      "The ballads",
      "Where would Eurovision be without a raven-haired woman bellowing into a wind machine set to \"hurricane\"?",
      "Israel has strong form in this category, and sets the bar again with New Day Will Rise, a melancholy piano ballad sung in a mixture of English, French and Hebrew.",
      "The song's performed by Yuval Raphael, a 24-year-old who narrowly escaped with her life at the 2023 Nova music festival, where an attack by Hamas claimed the lives of 378 people and triggered Israel's ongoing offensive in Gaza.",
      "It's hard not to interpret her lyrics as a response to those events \u2013 \"everyone cries, don't cry alone\". As a result, her participation hasn't received the same level of criticism as Eden Golan, who represented Israel last year.",
      "That can't be said for Georgia's contestant, Mariam Shengelia, who has been booed during pre-Eurovision appearances for her alleged support of the country's authoritarian, pro-Russian, anti-LGBT ruling party, Georgian Dream.",
      "Shengelia has denied the accusations, pointing out that her song \u2013 a stirring, quasi-militaristic ballad called Freedom \u2013 is about \"freedom of choice, freedom to love, freedom to live as you want to live\".",
      "\"No amount of manufactured hate will change that,\" she told the Eurovision fan site Wiwibloggs.",
      "Montenegro's Nina \u017di\u017ei\u0107 tackles domestic abuse in Dobrodo\u0161li, a brooding and refined orchestral ballad.",
      "The singer, who previously entered Eurovision in 2013 with the cyborg pop oddity Igranka, delivers her lyrics with passion and sincerity, but somehow the song never quite takes off.",
      "Last but not least, we have defending champions Switzerland, represented by 24-year-old Zo\u00eb M\u00eb, who describes herself as a \"little fairy\".",
      "Appropriately enough, her self-penned song, Voyage is delicate as a fairy's wings,   fluttering with a soft-spoken plea to treat each other with kindness.",
      "Automatically qualifying for the final, it's a welcome oasis of calm amidst the steamy sauna sessions, moody goth haircuts and thrusting innuendo.",
      "But that's Eurovision for you. All human life is here. See you in Basel!",

    "summary": "Economic pressures are forcing Donald Trump and Xi Jinping to seek an off-ramp in the trade war.",
    "story": [
      "The US-China trade war could be letting up, with the world's two largest economies set to begin talks in Switzerland.",
      "Top trade officials from both sides will meet on Saturday in the first high-level meeting since US President Donald Trump hit China with tariffs in January.",
      "Beijing retaliated immediately and a tense stand-off ensued as the two countries heaped levies on each other. New US tariffs on Chinese imports stand at 145%, and some US exports to China face duties of 125%.",
      "There have been weeks of stern, and sometimes fiery, rhetoric where each side sought to paint the other as the more desperate party.",
      "And yet this weekend they will face each other over the negotiating table.",
      "So why now?",
      "Saving face",
      "Despite multiple rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs, both sides have been sending signals that they want to break the deadlock. Except it wasn't clear who would blink first.",
      "\"Neither side wants to appear to be backing down,\" said Stephen Olson, senior visiting fellow at Singapore's ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and a former US trade negotiator.",
      "\"The talks are taking place now because both countries have judged that they can move forward without appearing to have caved in to the other side.\"",
      "Still, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian emphasised on Wednesday that \"the talks are being held at the request of the US\".",
      "And the commerce ministry framed it as a favour to Washington, saying it was answering the \"calls of US businesses and consumers\".",
      "The Trump administration, however, claims it's Chinese officials who \"want to do business very much\" because \"their economy is collapsing\".",
      "\"They said we initiated? Well, I think they ought to go back and study their files,\" Trump said at the White House on Wednesday.",
      "But as the talks drew closer, the president struck a more diplomatic note: \"We can all play games. Who made the first call, who didn't make the - it doesn't matter,\" he told reporters on Thursday. \"It only matters what happens in that room.\"",
      "The timing is also key for Beijing because it's during Xi's visit to Moscow. He was a guest of honour on Friday at Moscow's Victory Day parade to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the World War Two victory over Nazi Germany.",
      "Xi stood alongside leaders from across the Global South - a reminder to Trump's administration that China not only has other options for trade, but it is also presenting itself as an alternative global leader.",
      "This allows Beijing to project strength even as it heads to the negotiating table.",
      "The pressure is on",
      "Trump insists that the tariffs will make America stronger, and Beijing has vowed to \"fight till the end\"- but the fact is the levies are hurting both countries.",
      "Factory output in China has taken a hit, according to government data. Manufacturing activity in April dipped to the lowest level since December 2023. And a survey by news outlet Caixin this week showed that services activity has reached a seven-month low.",
      "The BBC found that Chinese exporters have been reeling from the steep tariffs, with stock piling up in warehouses, even as they strike a defiant note and look for markets beyond the US.",
      "\"I think [China] realises that a deal is better than no deal,\" says Bert Hofman, a professor at the East Asian Institute in National University Singapore.",
      "\"So they've taken a pragmatic view and said, 'OK, well we need to get these talks going.'\"",
      "And so with the major May Day holiday in China over, officials in Beijing have decided the time is right to talk.",
      "On the other side, the uncertainty caused by tariffs led to the US economy contracting for the first time in three years.",
      "And industries that have long depended on Chinese-made goods are especially worried. A Los Angeles toy company owner told the BBC that they were \"looking at the total implosion of the supply chain\".",
      "Trump himself has acknowledged that US consumers will feel the sting.",
      "American children may \"have two dolls instead of 30 dolls\", he said at a cabinet meeting this month, \"and maybe the two dolls will cost a couple bucks more than they would normally\".",
      "Trump's approval ratings have also slid over fears of inflation and a possible recession, with more than 60% of Americans saying he was focusing too much on tariffs.",
      "\"Both countries are feeling pressure to provide a bit of reassurance to increasingly nervous markets, businesses, and domestic constituencies,\" Mr Olson says.",
      "\"A couple of days of meetings in Geneva will serve that purpose.\"",
      "What happens next?",
      "While the talks have been met with optimism, a deal may take a while to materialise.",
      "The talks will mostly be about \"touching base\", Mr Hofman said, adding that this could look like an \"exchange of positions\" and, if things go well, \"an agenda [will be] set for future talks\".",
      "The negotiations on the whole are expected to take months, much like what happened during Trump's first term.",
      "After nearly two years of tit-for-tat tariffs, the US and China signed a \"phase one\" deal in early 2020 to suspend or reduce some levies. Even then, it did not include thornier issues, such as Chinese government subsidies for key industries or a timeline for scrapping the remaining tariffs.",
      "In fact, many of them stayed in place through Joe Biden's presidency, and Trump's latest tariffs add to those older levies.",
      "What could emerge this time is a \"phase one deal on steroids\", Mr Olson said: that is, it would go beyond the earlier deal and try to address flashpoints. There are many, from the illegal fentanyl trade which Washington wants China to crack down harder on to Beijing's relationship with Moscow.",
      "But all of that is far down the line, experts warn.",
      "\"The systemic frictions that bedevil the US-China trade relationship will not be solved any time soon,\" Mr Olson adds.",
      "\"Geneva will only produce anodyne statements about 'frank dialogues' and the desire to keep talking.\"",
      "Talks or no talks: Who blinks first in US-China trade war?",
      "'We don't care': A defiant China looks beyond Trump's America",
      "Xi's real test is not Trump's trade war",

    "published": "Thu, 08 May 2025 23:02:07 GMT",
    "summary": "Ex-banker Innes Tang has established a hotline for reporting behaviours deemed disloyal to Beijing.",
    "story": [
      "From a woman waving a colonial-era flag in a shopping mall, to bakery staff selling cakes with protest symbols on them - dozens of Hongkongers have been reported to the police by one man for what he believes were national security violations.",
      "\"We're in every corner of society, watching, to see if there is anything suspicious which could infringe on the national security law,\" former banker Innes Tang tells the BBC World Service.",
      "\"If we find these things, we go and report it to the police.\"",
      "When the UK returned Hong Kong to China 28 years ago, internationally binding treaties guaranteed the city's rights and freedoms for 50 years. But the national security law (NSL), imposed by Beijing a year after Hong Kong's 2019 mass pro-democracy protests, has been criticised for scuttling free speech and press, and for ushering in a new culture of informing.",
      "The law criminalises activities considered to be calls for \"secession\" (breaking away from China), \"subversion\" (undermining the power or authority of the government), and collusion with foreign forces.",
      "An additional security law called Article 23, voted in last year, has further tightened restrictions.",
      "With new laws and arrests, there has been limited reporting on Hong Kong's pro-China \"patriots\" - the people who are now running and policing the city, as well as the ordinary citizens who openly support them. But the BBC has spent weeks interviewing Innes Tang, 60, a prominent self-described patriot.",
      "He and his volunteers have taken screen grabs from social media of any activities or comments they believe could be in breach of the NSL.",
      "He also established a hotline for tip-offs from the public and encouraged his online followers to share information on the people around them.",
      "Nearly 100 individuals and organisations have been reported to the authorities by him and his followers, he says.",
      "\"Does reporting work? We wouldn't do it if it didn't,\" Mr Tang says. \"Many had cases opened by the police\u2026 with some resulting in jail terms.\"",
      "Mr Tang says he hasn't investigated alleged law breakers himself, but simply reported incidents he thinks warrant scrutiny - describing it as \"proper community-police co-operation\".",
      "Mr Tang is not the only so-called patriot to engage in this kind of surveillance.",
      "Hong Kong's authorities have set up their own national security hotline, receiving 890,000 tip-offs from November 2020 to February this year - the city's security bureau told the BBC.",
      "For those who are reported to the authorities, pressure can be relentless.",
      "Since the NSL was enacted in 2020, up until February this year, more than 300 people had been arrested for national security offences. And an estimated 300,000 or more Hongkongers have permanently left the city in recent years.",
      "Pong Yat-ming, the owner of an independent bookshop that hosts public talks, says he often receives inspections from government departments which cite \"anonymous complaints\".",
      "He received 10 visits in one 15-day period, he says.",
      "Kenneth Chan, political scientist and university lecturer, who has been involved in the city's pro-democracy movement since the 1990s, jokes he has \"become a bit radioactive these days\".",
      "Some friends, students and colleagues now keep their distance because of his outspoken views, he says. \"But I would be the last person to blame the victims. It's the system.\"",
      "In response, Hong Kong's government said it \"attaches great importance to upholding academic freedom and institutional autonomy\". But it adds that academic institutions \"have the responsibility to ensure their operations are in compliance with the law and meet the interests of the community at large\".",
      "Innes Tang says he is motivated to report people by a love of Hong Kong, and that his views on China were cultivated when he was young, when the city was still a British colony.",
      "\"The colonial policies weren't really that great,\" he says. \"The best opportunities were always given to the British and we [the locals] did not really have access.\"",
      "Like many of his generation, he nursed a longing to be united with China and taken out of colonial governance. But he says many other Hongkongers at the time were more concerned with their livelihoods than their rights.",
      "\"Democracy or freedom. These were all very abstract ideas which we didn't really understand,\" he says.",
      "An average citizen should not become too involved in politics, he says, explaining he only became politically active to restore what he calls \"balance\" to Hong Kong society following the turbulence of 2019.",
      "He is giving a voice, he says, to what he calls \"the silent majority\" of Hongkongers who do not support independence from China, nor the disruption created by the protests.",
      "Outside of the UK - watch on YouTube",
      "But other Hongkongers consider rallies and demonstrations a longstanding tradition, and one of the only ways to voice public opinion in a city that now does not have a fully democratically elected leadership.",
      "\"We are no longer a city of protests,\" says Kenneth Chan, who specialises in Eastern European politics. \"So what are we? I don't have the answer yet.\"",
      "And patriotism isn't inherently a negative thing, he says.",
      "It is \"a value, maybe even a virtue\", he argues, although it needs to allow citizens to keep \"a critical distance\" - something that is not happening in Hong Kong.",
      "Electoral reform was pushed through in 2021 - stating that only \"patriots\" who \"swore loyalty to the Chinese Communist Party\" could hold important positions in government or the Legislative Council [LegCo] - Hong Kong's parliament.",
      "As a result, the council struggles to function, believes Hong Kong-based China commentator Lew Mon-hung, a former member of the Chinese government advisory body, the CPPCC.",
      "\"The public think a lot of these patriots are 'verbal revolutionaries' or political opportunists - they don't really represent the people,\" he says.",
      "\"That's why ridiculous policies still pass with a huge majority. There is no-one to constrain or oppose, no-one to scrutinise.\"",
      "Even patriot Innes Tang says he wants to see the current system challenged.",
      "\"I don't want to see every policy passing with 90% of the vote,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "There is a danger the National Security Law will be weaponised, he says, with people saying: \"If you don't agree with me, I accuse you of infringement of the national security law.\"",
      "\"I don't agree with this type of stuff,\" says Mr Tang.",
      "Hong Kong's government said: \"The improved LegCo is now rid of extremists who wish to obstruct and even paralyse the operation of the government without any intention of entering into constructive dialogue to represent the interests of all Hong Kong people.\"",
      "For now, says Mr Tang, he has stopped reporting on people. Balance and stability, he believes, has returned to Hong Kong.",
      "The number of large-scale protests has dwindled to none at all.",
      "In academia, fear of surveillance - and how life might change for someone who infringes the laws - means self-censorship and censorship have become the \"order of the day\", says Kenneth Chan.",
      "Pro-democracy parties are no longer represented in the Legislative Council and many have disbanded - including the Democratic Party of Hong Kong, once the most powerful party.",
      "Innes Tang has now set his sights overseas.",
      "\"There aren't any particular issues in Hong Kong now, so I asked myself - shouldn't I have a look at how I can continue to serve my community and my country?\" he says.",
      "\"For a non-politician and civilian like me, this is an invaluable opportunity.\"",
      "He now works as a representative for one of several pro-Beijing non-profit groups, regularly visiting the UN in Geneva to speak at conventions giving China's perspective on Hong Kong, human rights and other issues.",
      "Mr Tang is also in the process of establishing a media company in Switzerland, and registering as a member of the press.",
      "For Kenneth Chan in Hong Kong, his future hangs in the balance.",
      "\"One third of my friends and students are now in exile, another third of my friends and students are in jail, and I'm sort of\u2026 in limbo,\" he says.",
      "\"Today I'm speaking freely with you\u2026 no-one would promise me that I would continue doing it for the rest of my life.\"",
      "In a written reply to the BBC, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said that national security is a top priority and inherent right for any country. It \"only targets an extremely small minority of people and organisations that pose a threat to national security, while protecting the lives and property of the general public\"."

      "Actor Michael Pitt, known for his TV roles on \"Boardwalk Empire\" and \"Dawson's Creek,\" is accused of sexually assaulting his ex-girlfriend, choking her, and attacking her with a cinder block and a piece of lumber at his New York City home, according to a grand jury indictment.",
      "Pitt, 44, whose lawyers denied the allegations, was arrested Friday on nine counts, including first-degree sexual abuse, criminal sexual acts, assault, attempted assault and strangulation. The indictment cites four incidents between April 2020 and August 2021 at Pitt's home in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn.",
      "Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez's office declined to comment Wednesday beyond the allegations listed in the indictment.",
      "Pitt's lawyer, Jason Goldman, said he already had exonerating evidence and expected the case to be dismissed.",
      "\"Unfortunately, we live in a world where somebody like Mr. Pitt \u2014 an accomplished professional who would never so much as contemplate these crimes \u2014 can be arrested on the uncorroborated word of an unreliable individual,\" Goldman said in a text message to The Associated Press.",
      "He added, \"In reality, this baseless claim is suspiciously raised some four or five years after the alleged incident, from a time when the two parties were in a completely consensual relationship.\"",
      "Pitt pleaded not guilty to the charges on Friday and posted $100,000 bail, Goldman said. He is due back in court in Brooklyn on June 17.",
      "The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, which the woman in Pitt's case has not done.",
      "The indictment alleges Pitt forcibly touched his ex-girlfriend sexually in April 2020. In August 2020, the grand jury alleges Pitt forced oral sex on the woman and assaulted her with a 4-inch-by-4-inch piece of lumber.",
      "The indictment also says Pitt attacked her with a cinder block twice in June 2021 and choked her in August 2021.",
      "TMZ reported in 2022 that Pitt was arrested in Brooklyn for allegedly punching a man after taking his phone and, two months later, was brought to a hospital under police escort after a public outburst\u00a0in New York.",
      "Pitt, who grew up in West Orange, New Jersey, played the character Jimmy Darmody for two seasons on HBO's \"Boardwalk Empire,\" with the cast led by Steve Buscemi winning Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2011 and 2012 for outstanding performance by an ensemble in a drama series. The show also won\u00a0a Golden Globe for best drama series in 2011.",
      "His first major role came in the 2001 film \"Hedwig and the Angry Inch.\" In 2005, he starred in \"Last Days,\" director Gus Van Sant's film about a fictional rock star inspired by Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain. He also played Henry Parker in one season of The WB's \"Dawson's Creek\" in 1999-2000.",

      "Najjar's debut novel follows Lola Fine, a New York City content creator who retreats to the Hamptons after being canceled, only to discover her summer neighbor is a culture critic who wrote a scathing expos\u00e9 about her. The two unexpectedly begin a summer fling as Lola embarks on a journey of self-discovery.",

      "The Hamptons setting was chosen for its luxury and dramatic potential, Najjar said.",
      "\"My followers know my obsession with rich mom places. And it's shrouded in mystery. It's luxurious. A lot of drama goes down there,\" she said.",
      "She even incorporated real locations to provide reference points for readers.",
      "The book includes aspects of queer romance, which has drawn some criticism given Najjar's identity as a straight woman. Najjar said that she worked with a queer collaborator to ensure authentic representation.",
      "\"I think it's important to have a queer voice in the room, and that's why I wanted to work with a queer collaborator,\" she said. \"So we got that lived experience in the book and I think we nailed it, and it was an incredible experience working with her.

    "summary": "Music mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is facing trial on sex-trafficking charges. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, the music mogul accused of sexually assaulting, trafficking and otherwise exploiting women in recurring incidents over multiple decades, is standing trial on federal charges in New York City. Jury selection began May 5, and opening statements are expected on Monday, May 12.",
      "Combs, 55, faces multiple charges, including sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy. He has been jailed since September, when he was ordered held without bail. He has pleaded not guilty and at his final pre-trial hearing, rejected a plea deal.",
      "As the trial gets underway in Manhattan federal court, here's what to know.",
      "Combs will be tried on 5 charges",
      "One of the most powerful figures in hip-hop, Combs is accused of running a criminal enterprise, with help from associates and employees, since at least 2004 that engaged in or attempted to engage in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, obstruction of justice and other offenses, according to an indictment.",
      "Combs was initially charged in September 2024 with one count of racketeering conspiracy, one count of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one count of transportation for purposes of prostitution. A superseding indictment brought two additional counts \u2014 one of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and one of transportation for purposes of prostitution \u2014 against him in early April.",
      "The indictment alleges Combs \"engaged in a persistent and pervasive pattern of abuse toward women and other individuals,\" which was \"verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual.\" It accuses him of manipulating women into participating in commercial sex acts with him and sometimes with male sex workers. He allegedly arranged for women and the sex workers to be flown to him.",
      "The acts with sex workers, which prosecutors say Combs called \"freak offs,\" are described in the indictment as elaborate performances that Combs directed and often filmed with or without participants' consent. Prosecutors have alleged the events involved excessive drug use, \"in part to keep the victims obedient and compliant,\" and sometimes lasted multiple days.",
      "Combs is also accused of assaulting women repeatedly over many years by \"striking, punching, dragging, throwing objects at, and kicking them,\" the indictment said. The violence extended to his employees and people who witnessed his alleged abuse, prosecutors say. In one instance, Combs is accused of dangling a victim over an apartment balcony, according to the indictment.",
      "In addition to abuse, Combs allegedly maintained control over victims with money, drugs and threats to their careers, among other means. Prosecutors also allege Combs used bribes and blackmail to hide evidence of his conduct.",
      "According to prosecutors, the racketeering conspiracy charge involves allegations that Combs sex-trafficked three victims and forced a fourth, one of his employees, into sexual activity with him. The indictment refers to three female victims as Victim-1, Victim-2 and Victim-3.",
      "Four accusers are expected to testify against Combs, according to prosecutors.",
      "If Combs is found guilty on all counts, he could face up to life in prison. He has pleaded not guilty to each of the charges against him.",
      "His attorneys have said the allegations against him came from \"former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships.\"",
      "\"This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion,\" the defense said in a statement in April following the superseding indictment.",
      "2016 hotel security video",
      "A security tape showing Combs attacking his then-girlfriend, R&B singer Casandra Ventura, who performs under the name Cassie, in 2016 is expected to serve as a key piece of evidence for prosecutors during the trial.",
      "The video shows Combs throwing Ventura to the floor in the hallway of a Los Angeles hotel, kicking her and dragging her. CNN\u00a0obtained and published\u00a0the footage last year following public allegations of physical and sexual violence against Combs.",
      "Ventura accused Combs of rape and physical abuse in a lawsuit in November 2023 that was settled the day after she filed it. The lawsuit also alleges Combs paid the hotel $50,000 for the 2016 security footage.",
      "Combs apologized for his behavior seen in the video but denied the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "Prosecutors contend the assault in the video happened during a \"freak off.\" Combs lawyers, who tried to convince the judge to exclude it from the trial, argue the footage was nothing more than a \"glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\" between the two.",
      "U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs' lawyers failed to convince him that the footage should be excluded. Its relevance to the case outweighs any potential prejudice to Combs, the judge said.",
      "Jury selection",
      "Twelve jurors and six alternates will be chosen for the trial.",
      "Prospective jurors were asked if they had been aware of the case, if they have any experience with sexual assault or domestic violence, what their views on law enforcement are, how they view hip-hop artists, and what their feelings about having multiple partners are, among other questions.",
      "They were also given a lengthy list of people and places and asked if they recognized any of the names, which included rapper Kanye West, who now goes by Ye; rapper Kid Cudi; actor Michael B. Jordan; actor Mike Myers; singer Aubrey O'Day; and Ventura, Combs' ex-girlfriend and one of his accusers.",
      "It was not immediately clear how all the people on the list will be referenced, if at all, during the trial.",
      "Ahead of jury selection, Combs' legal team and prosecutors disagreed on what to include in the questionnaire used to evaluate potential jurors.",
      "In court filings, Combs' attorneys argued that prosecutors' proposed questionnaire did not \"explore at all the prejudices and biases that are central to an effective inquiry to seating a fair jury\" nor acknowledge \"the unprecedented and negative media attention they may have been exposed to, related to Mr. Combs.\"",
      "They requested that jurors be questioned about their views regarding sex, drugs, violence and people with multiple sexual partners.",
      "Prosecutors criticized the defense's proposed questionnaire as too long and touching on subjects that would be better asked in person by the judge, if at all. They said some of the questions were \"utterly irrelevant to the ability to serve on a jury.\"",

      "It was Harris' first time at the benefit for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. In an interview with Vogue published ahead of the blue carpet event, Harris emphasized the importance of art and how it intertwines with politics.",
      "\"Art has always had a significant impact on not just culture, but also our policies and politics,\" Harris told Vogue. \"Artistic expression \u2014 whether it's dance, music, visual arts or fashion \u2014 has a way of capturing the mood and language of the people without words. Art has the power to shape the conversation about where we are today and where we need to go.\"",
      "To embrace the 2025 Met Gala theme, inspired by the Met's exhibit \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style,\" the former vice president wore a black-and-white Off-White gown designed by the brand's creative director IB Kamara, according to Vogue. Harris attended with her husband, Doug Emhoff, Vogue said.",
      "While politicians are no strangers to the Met Gala, many of them have been local New York City lawmakers in recent years, including Mayor Eric Adams and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. In 2022, Hillary Clinton returned to fashion's biggest night 21 years after her debut. And in 1977, Ronald Reagan attended the Met Gala between his terms as governor of California and president of the United States.",
      "Harris may be eyeing a political return of her own.",
      "Speaking in San Francisco last week, in her first major public remarks since her 2024 presidential defeat, Harris blasted President Trump's economic agenda, including his tariffs. She also suggested she's been having conversations about her future, as California prepares to elect its next governor in 2026 and Democrats search for a presidential candidate to run in 2028.",
      "\"Everybody is asking me, 'Well, what've you been thinking about these days,'\" she said.",

Rebellion was also apparent in the hairstyles exhibited, most notably by singer Miley Cyrus, a fashion fanatic, whose short, spiked look paired perfectly with her risque fishnet Marc Jacobs gown.",

      "Zendaya's first and second look, 2024 Met Gala",
      "Zendaya has become a favorite at the Met Gala, and last year she was a co-chair, alongside Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez, Chris Hemsworth and, of course, Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. The night's theme was \"Sleeping Beauties: Fashion Reawakened,\" and the dress code was \"Garden of Time.\"",
      "The \"Dune\" and \"Euphoria\" star opened the evening in an ocean blue gown by Maison Margiela with fitted a corset and layers of metallic fabric, styled with a feather headpiece and smokey makeup.",
      "Then hours later, she made a surprise return on the red carpet with a second look. She appeared in a never-before-worn Givenchy couture gown from the 1996 collection -- the year she was born -- along with a vintage Alexander McQueen hat adorned with a bouquet of roses.",
      "\"When it comes to the Met carpet, Zendaya is all about keeping us guessing-but one thing is for certain: She will always turn heads. Clearly, she did it again tonight,\" Vogue's Senior Fashion and Style Writer Christian Allaire wrote of her back-to-back looks.",
      "Bad Bunny pays homage to Puerto Rico, 2024 Met Gala",

      "He wore a navy smoking jacket with red and white stitching, topped with a large beret and gold sunglasses.",
      "The Puerto Rican artist arrived on the red carpet carrying a floral bouquet made from the same fabric as his jacket. The blooms represented the flor de maga -- the national flower of Puerto Rico -- along with roses and the flax plant that Sleeping Beauty pricked her finger on in the fairy tale.",
      "His backless, all-white look from 2023, honoring\u00a0late designer Karl Lagerfeld, also gets an honorable mention on the list.",
      "Tyla's sand dress, 2024 Met Gala",
      "Tyla stopped the show at her inaugural Met Gala in a strapless dress made of sand. The look was so formfitting, she had to be carried up the Met's iconic steps.",
      "The Balmain   design was made up of three colors of sand and crystal studs.",
      "\"We were looking to do something creative, something completely different for my first Met Gala,\" the singer and songwriter told Vogue ahead of the event. \"So when Balmain showed me the idea and sketch, I just knew it was perfect. The idea was crazy, and I loved it.\"",
      "She also carried an hourglass clutch in a nod to \"the sands of time.\"",
      "Michaela Coel dripping in gold, 2023 Met Gala",
      "Michaela Coel was a co-chair for the 2023 Met Gala and she dazzled in a floor-length gown by Schiaparelli that was covered in crystals, accompanied by a large diamond necklace and chunky gold earrings.",
      "The \"I May Destroy You\" creator's skin was glowing, with the help of makeup artist Bernicia Boateng, who told Vogue she \"wanted her skin to beam and almost speak for her.\"",
      "\"Anna [Wintour] has been a real champion of me, she put me on the cover of American Vogue,\" Coel said in a behind-the-scenes interview as she got ready for the gala. \"She said that I am not afraid to be myself... and that's why she asked me to co-chair.\"",
      "Her fellow co-chairs included Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Roger Federer and Dua Lipa.",
      "Doja Cat goes full cat, 2023 Met Gala",
      "Love it or hate it, Doja Cat did not hold back for the 2023 Met Gala. It was her first time attending, and she fully embraced -- and embodied -- the theme, dressing up as Karl Lagerfeld's beloved cat, a Burmese named Choupette.",
      "Doja Cat wore an Oscar de la Renta gown with cat ears on the hood and a large diamond that dangled in front of her forehead. To complete her cat transformation, her makeup featured black cat eyeliner and made her nose look more cat-like.",
      "The Grammy winner famously stayed in character for her red carpet interview, answering every question with \"meow.\"",
      "Choupette, who Lagerfeld reportedly received as a gift from French model Baptiste Giabiconi, has her own Instagram account with more than a quarter million followers.",
      "Blake Lively's NYC inspired gown, 2022 Met Gala",
      "Blake Lively has been gracing the Met Gala for more than a decade, and she ramped up the drama in recent years. She wore a stunning Atelier  Versace gown for the 2022 Met Gala, drawing inspiration from New York City landmarks to fit the theme \"In America: An Anthology of Fashion.\"",
      "Lively made an entrance on The Met steps worthy of her \"Gossip Girl\" character Serena Van Der Woodsen. Her first look featured a metallic bodice and bow inspired by the Manhattan skyline and Empire State Building, then it transformed into a long blue-green train based on Grand Central's constellation ceiling. She also wore a seven-tier crown to symbolize the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Husband Ryan Reynolds was by her side to co-chair the event in a black velvet tuxedo by Ralph Lauren.",
      "Lively also made the best-dressed list with another Versace gown at the 2018 Met Gala in a jeweled bodice and detailed embroidery, paired with a halo headpiece.",

      "Speaking of epic entrances, Lil Nas X put on a show at the 2021 Met Gala with three distinct looks from Donatella Versace.",
      "He started in a large, gold cape that was then removed to reveal a golden suit of armor underneath, which he later shed to show off a crystal-covered body suit.",
      "The fashion house called it a \"three-part LGBTQ+ American fairytale.\" The cape was meant to conceal his identity, the armor symbolized protection against prejudice, and finally the body suit represented \"living life as your true, unguarded self.\"",
      "The artist is known for his daring fashion choices, including his purple prom look at the MTV Awards just days before.",
      "Iman's latest iconic look, 2021 Met Gala",
      "Nobody does it quite like Iman. The supermodel has worn so many iconic looks over the years, but the 2021 Met Gala will go down as one of her best.",
      "Her outfit from Harris Reed, supported by Dolce & Gabbana, featured a gold strapless jumpsuit under a massive hoop skirt and matching headpiece made of feathers.",
      "Reed told Vogue they were inspired by 18th-century hooped cage skirts that could \"take up space in a way that says, 'I deserve to be here and I own it.'\"",
      "Iman first attended the Met Gala in 1981 with Calvin Klein and later appeared alongside her husband and fellow fashion icon, David Bowie.",
      "Maluma's red leather suit, 2021 Met Gala",
      "Maluma was the first reggaet\u00f3n artist to attend the Met Gala when he made his debut in 2019 and he continues to push the envelope.",
      "He joined Donatella Versace for the 2021 Met Gala in a red-hot leather suit with bejeweled accents and accessories.",
      "\"My favorite part of my outfit was everything,\" Maluma told Vogue. \"I loved the cowboy inspiration, as I ride horses, but the highlight was the belt... It was a signature Versace cowboy belt inspired by the late Gianni Versace's classic '90s looks.\"",
      "He also wore a 14-karat gold chain link glove with his nickname, Papi Juancho, written in stones.",
      "Zendaya's light-up Cinderella look, 2019 Met Gala",
      "First, there was Joan of Arc in 2018. Then, her Cinderella gown was among the highlights of the wacky and weird 2019 Met Gala, \"Camp: Notes on Fashion.\"",
      "With the wave of a wand from her stylist and fairy godfather Law Roach, the dress lit up The Met steps, literately. It magically changed from gray to blue, prompting a large cheer from the crowd.",
      "Roach said the gown, by Tommy Hilfiger, represented Zendaya's transformation from the Disney Channel to \"Euphoria\" and more adult roles.",
      "As for last year's looks, he said Zendaya wasn't even fitted until Saturday, two days before the big event.",
      "\"I haven't seen Zendaya's dress!\" he told The New York Times in an interview ahead of time. \"We've been on two press tours - 'Dune 2' and 'Challengers' - and doing two Vogue covers.\"",
      "Time to work their Met Gala magic once again.",

      "Her sisters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, wore coordinated sheer Versace dresses embellished with bright orange and purple feathers, respectively. Kylie was joined by her on-again-off-again boyfriend, Travis Scott.",
      "And of course it wouldn't be a Kardashian photo-op without mom, Kris Jenner. She had on a navy blue Tommy Hilfiger jumpsuit with oversized gray shoulders, plus a platinum blonde wig that was reportedly a last-minute suggestion from Kylie.",
      "The Kardashian sisters have been known for some hit-or-miss looks over the years, including Kim's infamous \"black-out\" look in 2021.",
      "Billy Porter goes for gold, 2019 Met Gala",
      "Oh Billy Porter, where to begin. His 2019 Met Gala look was one for the ages.",
      "Porter entered the event lounging on a platform carried by six shirtless men. He then climbed down to spread a pair of giant, golden wings.",
      "In a behind-the-scenes interview before the big reveal, he told Vogue that \"Camp\" is often discounted or \"thought of as cheesy,\" but, \"when it's done properly, it's one of the highest forms of fashion and art.\"",
      "Porter enlisted New York City-based brand The Blonds to design the Ancient Egypt-inspired look.",
      "\"Given the massive collection of Egyptian art The Met has, it was also our way to pay respect to that,\" he said.",
      "Lady Gaga's many looks, 2019 Met Gala",
      "Before Lil Nas X and Blake Lively pulled off multiple outfits, Lady Gaga was the original shapeshifter at the 2019 Met Gala. It was almost like the star was born to take on the theme.",
      "Lady Gaga rocked four different looks all designed by her friend, Brandon Maxwell. First, she arrived in a massive pink dress with a 25-foot train and five dancers carrying umbrellas. As she entered The Met steps, her team unzipped the cape to reveal another black gown underneath.",
      "Then she unveiled another pink dress paired with large black sunglasses, appearing to apply makeup and pose for selfies. And finally, she shed that dress and stripped down to a black bra, panties, stockings and boots.",

      "Queen Bey's younger sister also made the list for the 2015 Met Gala with a head-scratching mini dress.",

      "Andre Leon Talley, a red carpet staple, 2015 Met Gala",

      "\"I loved this dress. It was slim-fitting and body-hugging, and just glistened,\" she told Vogue in a 2020 interview. \"I remember when I saw this dress for the first time, I thought, wow, Gianni, is that for me? It seemed like one of those dresses that you read in those fairytale books.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"Oh, Mary!\" may be Broadway's most unlikely offering this season, a wildly over-the-top, not-at-all historically accurate look at first lady Mary Todd Lincoln, written by and starring Cole Escola.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"For God's sake, Mary! How would it look for the first lady of the United States to be flitting about a stage right now in the ruins of war?\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"How would it look? Sensational!!\"",
      "It's a broad comedy about Mary's secret passion of becoming a cabaret star. Meanwhile, her husband, Abe, is just wrapping up the Civil War, and is more concerned with keeping the country together.",
      "Abraham Lincoln: \"No! It's inappropriate! We're at war!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"With who?\"Abraham Lincoln: \"The south!\"Mary Todd Lincoln: \"Of what?\"",
      "It's not a revival, it has no movie stars (\"Well, speak for yourself, Mo!\"), and it's a smash hit, breaking box office records.",
      "What does that say? \"Inflation is high,\" Escola laughed.",
      "Escola came up with the idea in 2009: \"I sent an email to myself that said, 'What if Abraham Lincoln's assassination wasn't such a bad thing for Mary Todd?' You know, like, Mary's starting over. Like, 'Now I'm single. I can date.' You know?\"",
      "But this fever dream Mary remained just a dream for years. \"I loved this idea so much, I didn't want it to get on paper and for it to disappoint me \u2013 to disappoint me, not just the audience, but, like, me,\" Escola said. \"There are certain ideas that you're just like, 'Oh, I don't wanna plant this seed, because what if it's an ugly flower?'\"",
      "Escola eventually wrote the play. \"Oh, Mary!\" opened to rapturous reviews downtown, quickly moved uptown to Broadway, and just this week earned five Tony nominations, including two for 38-year-old Escola (for best play and best actor).",
      "It's all a long way from rural Oregon, where Escola was raised. The family had little money, with a Vietnam veteran father, Escola says, who suffered from mental illness. \"When I was maybe five years old, my father chased us out of the home with a shotgun. He was having some sort of alcoholic manic break and thought that there were people after him. And so, he chased my mother and my brother and I out of the trailer, and then we moved out and didn't come back.\"",
      "The family moved in with Escola's grandmother. \"Then, her and I shared a bedroom, and I remember that's when she taught me to read. And she was in the beginning stages of Alzheimer's so she would repeat stories a lot. But I loved them. I loved her stories. I realize now, when she would tell these stories, we were, like, meeting in the middle of her memory. Like, she was living out the fantasy of her childhood, and I was also living out my fantasy of being a young girl on a farm in Alberta.\"",
      "I asked, \"And you didn't mind that she was repeating the stories?\"",
      "\"No, no,\" Escola replied. \"Because she would remember certain details in a new telling or, like, leave something out, and then I got to be, like, you know, 'And you were wearing a dress, right, Gramma?'\"",
      "\"And is it right that she gave you a Barbie when you were five?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She gave me my first Barbie. just completely took me at face value when I was doing something that wasn't what boys were supposed to do.\"",
      "Her understanding proved prescient. Escola now uses they/them pronouns. Asked to explain, Escola said, \"I have always felt not male, not female. And you know, it's funny, because recently I saw photos of me on Instagram. The comments were like, 'What is that? Like, that's not a man.' 'Well, it sure as hell ain't a woman, either.' And I was like, 'Exactly.' Like, you do get it.\"",
      "Likewise, Escola's comedic identity has never been in doubt.",
      "I asked, \"Comedically, have you always done your own thing?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"So, there was never a time where you thought, 'I need to be more like this person to make people respond to me'?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Escola. \"It would be like trying to speak German when I don't actually know any German. It has to make me laugh in order for it to even have a chance of making someone else laugh.\"",
      "Escola began performing in community theater back in Oregon, and eventually scraped together the money to make it to New York (\"It was New York or bust!\"), at first attending college and living at the 92nd Street Y. It was a short stint of only nine months. \"I had to drop out because they wouldn't let me take out any more loans. I guess I was so poor that they were like, 'You'll never be able to pay this back.'",
      "\"I felt like there was something wrong with me that I couldn't afford to go to school. That's the thing that makes me the most angry about being poor, just this innate sense that it's like a moral failing or an innate thing that's broken in you.\"",
      "Escola eventually did make it back to New York to stay, gaining a fan base with online videos, such as \"Mom Commercial\" (2015):",
      "\u2026 and then on TV, playing a range of deranged, yet delightful characters in shows like \"At Home with Amy Sedaris.\"",
      "And then along came Mary.",
      "I said, \"You don't come to see the show and go, 'Oh, there were layers and layers of development people that were saying, No, you've gotta tweak it for this audience and do this for that audience.'\"",
      "\"No,\" Escola said. \"There is something special about the fact that I wrote this for me and my friends, and for my audience that I've had in downtown venues and stuff. And the fact that it's successful is, I don't know, it makes it that much sweeter. It really does.\"",

    "summary": "When Alex Matisse founded East Fork Pottery, in Asheville, N.C., he didn't want to use the name of his great-grandfather, artist Henri Matisse. But after business took off, Alex decided it was time \u2013 and now graces his ceramics with the imagery of his famous forebear.",
    "story": [
      "As an apprentice to a potter, what Alex Matisse discovered shaped him like clay itself.\u00a0 \"When I walked in, I knew that this is what I was going to do,\" he said. \"We were told pots have skin and bones and skeletons and, like, a plate should have the fullness of the moon.\"",
      "Artful descriptions, much the way a painter might define their craft. In fact it was Henri Matisse who once said, \"I don't literally paint that table, but the emotion it produces upon me.\"",
      "When Alex founded East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, back in 2009, he took the same view. He saw ceramics as a canvas. It came easily, like it was woven into his DNA \u2013 because it was. Alex is the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse.",
      "I asked, \"What did you know of your great-grandfather when you were growing up?\"",
      "\"He was everywhere, kind of in the air that we breathed, around the house, on the walls,\" Alex replied.",
      "It was a famous last name he ran away from for years.\u00a0 \"I had a very grumpy relationship with it,\" he laughed. \"It was this kind of shadow thing that followed me around that I wanted to shake.\"",
      "Maybe it was stubbornness, or pride, but Alex was determined to make his own way. He convinced his soon-to-be-wife Connie to help him build a wood kiln on an old tobacco farm.",
      "I asked, \"Did she have the same passion for it that you did?\"",
      "\"No. She didn't have a passion for clay,\" Alex said.",
      "\"But she had a passion for you, so she kept going?\"",
      "\"Yeah. She stuck around,\" he laughed.",
      "And without anyone knowing who he really was, his business boomed. He could barely keep up with the demand. He realized, \"If we're gonna play in this world, something's gotta change. Like, we cannot keep doing it like we did.\"",
      "So, he decided to mechanize, at least partially. The pottery was still his, only he thought better, especially the colors.\u00a0 He was excited. \"And we sent out a postcard of these new pots that look, you know, they were plain, they had colors on them,\" he said. \"And nobody showed up. So overnight, we lost almost every single one of our customers. Like, they had thought we had lost our minds.\"",
      "And yet, he still refused to fall back on the Matisse name, and it turned out that belief in himself paid off.",
      "Today, he has legions of fans who call themselves \"Potheads.\" They buy, share and trade East Fork dinnerware online. On the secondary market, some of his early pieces can go for thousands of dollars.",
      "And so, with East Fork firmly established, about 18 months ago Alex decided it was time to use his own name. He, along with his sister and brother, poured over hundreds of works by their great-grandfather to find the ones that could be pottery perfect.",
      "\"We wanted something like the Blue Nude series that was instantly recognizable,\" Alex said. \"But then, I wanted some that spoke to me a little more personally.\"",
      "Decals were made of the chosen works, faithful to their great-grandfather's exacting details. Each one is carefully applied by hand, and inspected by hand over and over again.",
      "He says he doesn't wonder what his great-grandfather would think of his new collection. \"Oh, geez. No.\" Alex said, \"Because he was very serious. He was so focused on his work. Like, that's what he cared about.\"",
      "Henri Matisse once famously said, \"Creativity takes courage.\" His great-grandson Alex Matisse would certainly agree with that. His only caveat is that sometimes courage is all in the timing.",
      "\"There's not a heaviness to it,\" he said. \"It's just another layer. It's just another interesting part of my history, my family's history. And it feels great to celebrate it and share it.\"",

The center has been operating with an acting director since Marks left the FDA in March.",

Trumka, who was appointed to a 7-year term by President Biden in 2021, said he pushed back against DOGE because \"if these people are allowed in to govern our agency, they will gut it and the result will turn back the clock on product safety.\"",

They asked if we would allow them to implant at  our agency. They asked for our answer to that by 6 p.m. We said 'no.' And moments later, we were fired by email from the president.\"",

      "\"This is an appalling and lawless attack on the independence of our country's product safety watchdog,\" said William Wallace, director of safety advocacy for Consumer Reports, in an email. \"Anyone who cares about keeping their family safe should oppose this move and demand that it be reversed.\"",

      "\"The Consumer Product Safety Commission makes sure toys are safe for our kids and the products Americans use everyday don't have hidden hazards,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"It conducts thousands of investigations and issues crucial recalls .... This move is dangerous and illegal.\"",
      "DOGE firings",
      "DOGE has sought to cut federal workers in the name of reducing fraud, waste and abuse.

      "Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged in April, as steep tariffs on China make it too costly for many U.S.-based retailers to import goods from the country.",
      "President Trump ratcheted up his trade war with Beijing in April, hiking tariffs on Chinese goods to up to 145%. China retaliated with 125% levies on Americans goods.",
      "As a result, shipments of goods from China to the U.S. in April dropped 21% compared with the same period one year earlier, data released Friday from China's General Administration of Customs shows. Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, according to the April data, demonstrating how Mr. Trump's tariffs are already upending trade patterns.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said in a post on his social media site Truth Social that the levies on China could come down to 80%.\u00a0The lower rate \"seems right,\"\u00a0wrote the president, ahead of U.S.-China\u00a0trade negotiations set to kick off this weekend in Switzerland.",
      "While lower than the 145% tariffs currently in place, 80% levies would still make importing goods from China prohibitively expensive for many U.S.-based businesses. Many consumers, meanwhile, are unlikely to afford price hikes from steep tariffs at a time when they are already squeezed financially.",
      "Upending trade patterns",
      "Some business owners say they are skipping orders they would normally have already placed with Chinese factories, as they wait and see where tariff rates on China and other countries settle.",
      "Mr. Trump in April announced a bevy of country-specific tariffs, which he later placed on hold \u2014 with the exception of those on China \u2014 for\u00a090 days. A 10% tariff in place on all imports to the U.S. remains in effect. Businesses say the 10% baseline tax is a challenge, but far easier to absorb than duties over 100%.",
      "April's shakeup in the flow of goods around the world comes as many retailers rethink their supply chains, and some take steps to reduce their reliance on China, with steep levies in place.",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese imports from the U.S. dropped more than 13% compared with April 2024. Beijing could bring down its 125% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods, if trade negotiations between the two countries progress this weekend.",

    "summary": "President Trump says a new U.S. trade pact with the U.K. can serve as the basis for more trade deals. Economists say that could be a problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday hailed his new trade pact with the U.K. as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term.",
      "Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\"",
      "While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed on other nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank.",
      "Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say.",
      "\"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\"",
      "That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said.",
      "\"Modest improvement\"",
      "The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but \u2014 with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization \u2014 remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email.",
      "The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising the chances of a recession due to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled and U.S. Treasury prices slid in the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth.",
      "Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the new\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0with the U.K.",
      "While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In a recent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains.",
      "\"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\"",
      "Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle.",
      "\"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation \u2014 even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out.",
      "\"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\"",
      "Key meeting with China",
      "The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level.",
      "\"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" the president wrote\u00a0Friday morning.",
      "But that might not be enough to cushion the U.S. from the headwinds of higher tariffs, according to experts.",
      "\"Even if we were to see a continuation of the universal 10% tariff applied and some rollback of higher levels, or in the case of China, 145%, we're still talking about a tariff rate that is the highest since World War II,\" Luschini said. \"And so it's going to have an impact at some form.\"",

Additional country-based duties \u2014 with the exception of China \u2014 are currently on hold for 90 days.",
      "\"Manufacturers are, on a day-to-day basis, dealing with the shock of tariffs on products and are very willing to invest in supply chains,\" Gordon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are looking at what it takes to onshore products, but it takes time and investment.\"",
      "Gordon added that she believes the tariffs amount to a \"baby tax on every parent across the country.\"",

      "Steep new U.S. tariffs on imports are rattling businesses large and small, with many companies planning to absorb the higher costs by hiking prices for customers. Not footwear company Keen.",
      "Although the midsize company, based in Portland, Oregon, operates in an industry that is highly exposed to tariffs, Keen tells customers that it will keep prices steady this year no matter how tariffs affect its costs. That's no idle pledge calculated to preserve market share \u2014 Keen has been steadily retooling the business for years to protect itself from sudden shifts in global trade and the vagaries of geopolitics.",
      "\"We have been preparing for this for over a decade. Early on, we saw the risks of being overdependent on any one country, so we made the decision to diversify our supply chain well beyond China,\" Chief Operating Officer Hari Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 22-year-old company, with 650 U.S. employees and owned by design and brand management company Fuerst Group, has worked to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing while expanding its U.S. presence and diversifying its supply chains.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are upending retailer supply chains, forcing them to devise workarounds. That can mean moving manufacturing to another foreign country with lower tariffs or investing in U.S.-based production. For small businesses, tariff-driven uncertainty\u00a0can mean shutting operations down altogether when the financials no longer add up.",
      "Shoe and clothing prices could soar",
      "Footwear companies are particularly vulnerable to the upheaval caused by President Trump's trade war, given their reliance on China, where 36%, or $9.8 billion's worth, of imported footwear sold in the U.S. is made, according to a TD Cowen analysis of international trade data.",
      "For that reason, tariffs are expected to hit footwear and apparel companies hard, and that impact will be felt by American consumers as well, according to Jason Judd, a global supply-chain expert and executive director of Cornell University's Global Labor Institute.",
      "In 2023, U.S. households spent an average of about $1,700 per year on footwear and apparel, Judd said. He expects that figure to surge 70% in the short term, to $2,800 per family, because of tariff-related price hikes. In the coming years, meanwhile, consumers are still likely to be paying more for footwear and clothing because of higher global tariffs.",
      "\"That pain will lessen as terms and sourcing patterns change, but the longer-term costs per family will still be around a $425 increase per year.\"",
      "The abrupt change in tariff policies is already rippling across the industry. German sportswear giant Adidas last month warned U.S. customers that \"cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.\" And retailers across various industries, from apparel to food, have started passing some of the cost from higher import taxes to consumers in the form of\u00a0\"tariff surcharges.\"",
      "\"We saw the writing on the wall\"",
      "Today, Keen operates plants in Shepherdsville, Kentucky; the Dominican Republic; and Thailand, where it handles a third of the company's global production. It also contracts with manufacturing partners in Cambodia, India and Vietnam, all of which are subject to impending new U.S. levies. Cambodia faces a country-specific tariff rate of 49%, while Vietnam and India face levies of 47% and 27%, respectively.",
      "\"We do have 10% exposure in those countries, but the 10% tariff we're dealing with is significantly lower than what other companies are facing on products that would come out of China,\" Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Back in 2015, executives at Keen were already taking note of rising labor costs in China. Today, the company's broad supply chain helps it spread costs across the company, its manufacturing partners and their suppliers, he said. Keen, which is privately held, declined to share information on its annual revenues.",
      "\"We are making a conscious decision not to increase prices, but that's shared by our partners,\" he said. \"They share some of the costs with us, then they go to the company they buy materials from, and those tier-one suppliers share some of the costs as well.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said the details of the agreement are still being finalized and expects it to be finished in the coming weeks. But he said it includes \"billions of dollars\" of increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market, including for American agricultural products like beef and ethanol.",
      "Britain will also \"reduce or eliminate\" non-tariff barriers that Mr. Trump said discriminate against U.S. products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs, the president announced.",
      "He called the agreement a \"great deal for both our countries\" and said it is opening up access to Britain for U.S. products.",
      "\"It's going to be something very special for the U.K. and special for the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Delivering brief remarks by speakerphone, Starmer said the framework will boost trade between the U.S. and the U.K., protect and create jobs and open market access. Starmer called it a \"historic day\" that is a \"real tribute to the history that we have of working so closely together.\"",
      "The 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports, which was unveiled by the president last month as part of his \"Liberation Day\" announcement, remains in place. But under the plan, the first 100,000 vehicles imported into the U.S. by British automakers each year are subject to that 10% rate, and additional vehicles will face 25% rates, according to the White House.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the deal will raise $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. as a result of the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K. As part of the agreement, Rolls Royce engines will not be subject to tariffs, and a British airline will buy $10 billion in Boeing planes, the commerce secretary said.",
      "Mr. Trump had teased the announcement Wednesday, writing on social media that he would unveil a \"major trade deal\" with a \"big, highly respected country,\" which he did not identify at the time. On Thursday morning, the president posted on Truth Social that it \"should be a very big and exciting day for the United States of America and the United Kingdom.\"",
      "\"The agreement with the United Kingdom is a full and comprehensive one that will cement the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom for many years to come,\" he added. \"Because of our long time history and allegiance together, it is a great honor to have the United Kingdom as our FIRST announcement. Many other deals, which are in serious stages of negotiation, to follow!\"",
      "A social media post from Mr. Trump said the framework will raise $5 billion in new export opportunities for American farmers, ranchers and producers, and strengthen national security for both the U.S. and the U.K.",
      "\"This deal shows that if you respect America, and bring serious proposals to the table, America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS,\" the post said, teasing that there are \"many more to come.\"",

      "\"As you know, talks with the U.S. have been ongoing and you'll hear more from me about that later today,\" Starmer said at a defense conference in London.",
      "Mr. Trump placed a 10% tax on imports from Britain, as well as 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum on the premise that doing so would foster more factory jobs domestically.",
      "A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. The U.S. is the largest destination for British cars, accounting for more than a quarter of U.K. auto exports in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics.",
      "Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products. Starmer's government has said it won't lower U.K. food standards to allow in chlorine-rinsed American chicken or hormone-treated beef.",
      "If a deal is announced, the British government will see it as a vindication of Starmer's emollient approach to Mr. Trump, which has avoided direct confrontation or criticism. Unlike the European Union, Britain didn't announce retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to Mr. Trump's import taxes.",
      "A trade deal with the United Kingdom would be symbolically important and a relief for British exporters. But an agreement would do little to address Mr. Trump's core concern about persistent trade deficits that prompted him to impose import taxes on countries around the world.",
      "The U.S. ran a $11.9 billion trade surplus in goods with the U.K. last year, according to the Census Bureau. The $68 billion in goods that the U.S. imported from the U.K. last year accounted for just 2% of all goods imported into the country.",
      "The U.S. is much more important to the U.K. economy. It was Britain's biggest trading partner last year, according to government statistics, though the bulk of Britain's exports to the U.S. are services rather than goods.",
      "Mr. Trump has shown a desire to strike a trade agreement with the U.K. since it voted in 2016 to leave the European Union. Yet as recently as Tuesday, Mr. Trump showed no awareness of the possible terms of the deal when asked about its possibility.",

      "Some experts, however, believe negotiations will take longer.",
      "Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow with the Peterson Institute for International Economics believes that countries with whom the Trump administration is negotiating will have it in their interest to move slowly in their trade discussions.

      "While it's hard to predict what other potential tariff deals might include, Yeo, who has helped orchestrate several bilateral and mulitlateral trade negotiations in the past, said such agreements would likely be nonbinding \"gentlemen's agreements\" or memorandums of understanding.",

    "summary": "Companies are already moving to hike their prices as U.S. tariffs bite, a move economists say is likely to drive up inflation.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump claims that other countries and exporters to the U.S. will largely pick up the cost of tariffs. Yet recent data shows that companies are moving to pass along those added expenses to American consumers, which may push up prices.",
      "For example, 76% of Texas manufacturers said they plan to pass tariff-related costs to consumers, while 50% say they will absorb costs internally, according to recent\u00a0survey data\u00a0from Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Sl\u00f8k and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. Large retailers have also warned that steep new levies on U.S. imports are likely to drive up prices.",
      "\"The bottom line is that inflation will be rising significantly over the next six months,\" Sl\u00f8k wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Indeed, with businesses having to plan months in advance to account for tariffs, many companies are baking those costs into their pricing. In a recent EY survey of over 4,000 executives, two-thirds of respondents said they might have to pass tariff costs on to customers.",
      "The Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan policy institute based in Washington, D.C., notes that the economic fallout from the Trump administration's tariffs will fall largely on low- and middle-income consumers. The levies could cost households an average of $5,200 every year,\u00a0according to the nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Inflation ahead?",
      "Manufacturers expect their prices to increase 3.6% over the next 12 months, up from 2.3% in the last quarter of 2024, according to a recent survey from the National Association of Manufacturers, which cites manufacturers' concerns over trade.",
      "\"Nobody has the profitability to be able to eat the tariffs,\" David Loftus, CEO of the Electronic Component Industry Association, an industry trade group, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So the manufacturers pass to the distributors, who pass to the customers.\"",
      "A recent\u00a0Gallup poll found that nearly 90% of Americans expect tariffs to drive up prices this year. For now, tariffs have yet to budge prices \u2014 the Consumer Price Index in March\u00a0rose 2.4% on an annual basis, down from 2.8% in February.",
      "Yet many experts say that U.S. tariffs, coupled with retaliatory measures from other countries, are likely to boost consumer prices in the months ahead.",
      "\"With the new tariffs now in place, we look for a shift up in inflation, adding a headwind to already slowing consumer activity and economic growth,\" Nationwide economist Daniel Vielhaber told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that core inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, which tracks consumer spending, to rise this year to 3.8%, up from 2.6% in March. Electronics and apparel are likely to see the sharpest price increases, according to the investment bank.",
      "Tariffs are taxes paid by importers, which must pay the fees to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection when it accepts shipments at American ports. As a result, U.S. businesses typically pass on most or all of that cost to consumers through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "Mr. Trump has staunchly defended the tariffs as a way to restore what he calls fairness to global trade, reinvigorate U.S. manufacturers and generate federal revenues. When asked in a May 4 interview on\u00a0NBC's\u00a0\"Meet the Press\" whether higher duties on imports will drive up prices, he replied, \"No. I think tariffs are going to be great for us because it's going to make us rich.\"",
      "The president has also doubled down on his messaging that foreign exporters, not U.S. consumers, will absorb higher tariff costs. \"China probably will eat those tariffs,\" Mr. Trump said in an April 29\u00a0interview\u00a0with ABC News about the U.S. imposing tariffs of as high as 145% on Chinese goods.",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump has seemingly acknowledged that stepped-up tariffs could result in higher costs for some goods, such as toys. \"Maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls,\" he said in an\u00a0April 30 Cabinet meeting. \"And maybe the two dolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.\"",
      "Some companies already hiking prices",
      "After Mr. Trump on April 2 announced a 10% baseline tariff on U.S. imports, along with higher \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of other nations, a flurry of companies across a range of industries have announced that they will increase prices to offset higher costs.",
      "For example, power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker said in an April 30 earnings\u00a0call that they implemented a \"single-digit\" price increase on retail partners that month and that they're eyeing another price increase for later in the year.",
      "\"Given the magnitude of the current tariff rates, we are actively engaged with our channel partners about a second price increase, targeting implementation at the beginning of the third quarter,\" Chief Operating Officer Christopher Nelson said on the call.",
      "The CEO of consumer products giant Procter & Gamble, the maker of Tide, Old Spice, Tampax and other household brands, told CNBC\u00a0last month that price hikes are \"likely\" due to the uncertainty of tariffs. Adidas CEO Bjorn Goulden also told analysts in an April earnings call that there will be price increases in the U.S. market if U.S. duties on imported goods remain in place.",
      "\"So should the duties go away, again, there will, of course, not be price increases,\" he said. \"But I think we all agree that should these duties stay or even be higher, then, of course, it will cause a price increase in the market in general, not only in our category.\"",
      "Chinese online retailers Shein and Temu said in April that they planned to hike their prices, citing the U.S. eliminating a tariff loophole\u00a0for lower-cost goods. Relatedly, Temu has stopped shipping Chinese-made goods to customers in the U.S. following the May 2 expiration of the so-called de minimis exemption.",

      "In a press conference yesterday, Powell articulated the Fed's reasoning for holding steady, including that economic data \u2014 for now \u2014 shows that the U.S. is in relatively good shape. The Fed chair also noted that its policymakers want to hold off on making any moves until the effects of Mr. Trump's economic policies become clearer, such as the impact of his broad tariffs on inflation and economic growth.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday inaccurately claimed there is \"virtually NO INFLATION.\" Inflation rose 2.4% on an annual basis in March, which reflects a cooler pace than in the prior months yet is still above the Fed's stated goal of reaching a 2% annual pace.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is leaving its benchmark interest rate unchanged, resisting pressure from President Trump to lower U.S. borrowing costs as policy makers assess the economic impact of his trade policies.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The Fed said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since the central bank last moved to lower short-term rates in December.",
      "The federal funds rate \u2014 the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 helps determine what businesses and consumers pay in interest on loans and credit card debt.",
      "What does the Fed say about the economy?",
      "The Fed, which has a dual mandate to keep inflation low while maintaining a healthy job market, on Wednesday signaled that economic risks are on the rise.",
      "Concerns that Mr. Trump's tariffs could spur both higher inflation and unemployment were highlighted by Fed chair Jerome Powell in a press conference to talk about the central bank's decision. But Powell noted that while consumer and business sentiment has sharply dropped, the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs haven't yet materialized in hard economic data.",
      "\"We've judged that the risk to higher inflation and unemployment has risen\" since March, when the Fed last met, Powell said. But, he added, \"We can't say which way this will shake out.\"",
      "Because of the uncertainty of the economy's path under the Trump administration's trade policies, the central bank wants to take a wait-and-see approach, Powell added. At the benchmark rate's current level, the Fed has the flexibility to cut rates if unemployment rises, or hike rates if inflation reignites due to the impact of Mr. Trump's tariffs, he noted.",
      "At the same time, Powell noted there are concerns that the Fed could face a situation where its dual mandate is in tension, which could occur if inflation and unemployment simultaneously spike. In that scenario, the central bank would need to focus on which side of the mandate is the farthest from the Fed's goal, and prioritize taming that part of the economy, he added.",
      "\"This would be a complicated and challenging judgment we would have to make,\" Powell said. \"If the two goals are in tension \u2014 if unemployment is moving up in an uncomfortable way, and so is inflation \u2014 we would look at how far they are\" from the Fed's targets, and focus first on the economic issue that's under greater stress, he added.",
      "Wall Street interpreted Powell's comments as signaling an increased risk that the U.S. economy could slide into stagflation, or a combination of slower economic growth and higher inflation.",
      "\"The Fed still sees the economy on solid footing, but acknowledges upside risk to both sides of their mandate \u2014 unemployment and inflation \u2014 because of tariffs,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in an email. \"With stagflation risks rising, the Fed's communications will emphasize patience until there is enough clarity in the data.\"",
      "What the Fed decision means",
      "The Fed's to hold interest rates steady comes amid pressure from Mr. Trump to cut interest rates, with the president\u00a0writing\u00a0on social media last month that the central bank has been \"TOO LATE AND WRONG\" for holding off on further reductions.",
      "The latest Fed statement offers no clues on when it might consider easing monetary policy, according to Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "\"We continue to expect that, with tariffs likely to generate a modest slowdown in GDP growth to around 1.5%, the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged for all of this year,\" he said in a report.",
      "Economists are forecasting that Mr. Trump's tariffs will boost inflation later this year. That could provide the Fed with the impetus to cut rates, although inflation\u00a0cooled in March.",
      "Given more subdued inflation and a buoyant job market, most economists had\u00a0projected\u00a0that the Fed would maintain interest rates at today's meeting, despite some headwinds such as eroding\u00a0consumer confidence\u00a0and a sharp decline in\u00a0first-quarter\u00a0U.S. economic growth.",
      "\"For the time being the Fed remains in a holding pattern as it waits for uncertainty to clear,\" said Ashish Shah, CIO of public investing at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, in an email after the Fed's announcement.",
      "Shah added, \"Recent better-than-feared jobs data has supported the Fed's on-hold stance, and the onus is on the labor market to weaken sufficiently to bring a resumption of its easing cycle.\"",

      "The film industry has taken multiple hits in recent years, notably the COVID pandemic in 2020 and the Hollywood strikes in 2023. Production has failed to return to pre-pandemic levels since\u00a0experiencing a 22% drop in the first quarter of 2025 from 2024 levels.",
      "Last year, Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass proposed an increase in California's annual film tax credit\u00a0from $330 million to $750 million.",
      "Mr. Trump spoke about Newsom and many other topics when questioned by reporters during an Oval Office meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Tuesday. A day earlier, during a meeting with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and others to announce that the NFL draft would be held in Washington in 2027, the president also talked about Newsom and Hollywood.",
      "He said the American film industry has been \"decimated\" by other countries and the \"grossly incompetent\" Newsom, which he said caused the film industry to \"abandon\" the U.S. But he vowed that \"we'll get it back.\" He said he'll be meeting with some film industry executives to \"make sure they're happy with\" the prospective tariffs.",
      "The president referred to the California High-Speed Rail\u00a0project, which would run between San Francisco and Los Angeles.",
      "\"A little train going from San Francisco to Los Angeles that's being run by Gavin Newscum, the governor of California. Ever heard of Gavin Newscum?\" Mr. Trump said. \"That train is the worst cost overrun thing I've ever seen. ... It's hundreds of billions for a stupid project that should've never been built.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did have some brief but kind words for Newsom in the midst of his barrage.",
      "\"And Gavin, you know, I always like Gavin, had a good relationship with him,\" he said.",
      "He also touched on the January wild fires, claiming that he gave water to California.",
      "\"I just got him a lot of water. I sent in people to open up that water, because he refused to do it,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If they would have had that water and if they would have done what I said to do, they wouldn't have had the fires in Los Angeles, those fires would have been put out very quickly,\"",
      "The president visited Los Angeles in late-January with the first lady, weeks after two massive fires devastated opposite ends of Los Angeles County. He was greeted by Newsom when he landed at the airport.",
      "\"I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,\" Mr. Trump said at the time. \"I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the side of it, we flew over it in a helicopter. We flew to a few of the areas, and it is devastation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's comments ended with a challenge for the Golden State's governor.",
      "\"I'd love him to run for president on the other side. I'd love to see that, but I don't think he's going to be running because that one project alone, well, that and the fires and a lot of other things pretty much put him out of the race,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Top advisers have sent President Trump a plan to create a government-run investment fund, a request the president made earlier this year \u2014 but the White House has rejected parts of the proposal, CBS News has learned.",
      "Mr. Trump asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick to jointly develop a proposal for a U.S. sovereign wealth fund by early May.",
      "It has been submitted, multiple sources told CBS News on Wednesday. However, the White House had concerns about the approach taken by Treasury, one of the sources said.",
      "Details on the mechanics of the fund continue to be debated, and no announcement is imminent, one source said.",
      "\"In accordance with President Trump's executive order, the Treasury and Commerce Departments have formulated plans for a Sovereign Wealth Fund, but no final decisions have yet been made,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The Administration remains committed to using every tool available to deliver on President Trump's directive to safeguard America's national and economic security.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Trump has teased a \"very big announcement\" before he leaves for the Middle East next week, but it's unrelated to the proposed sovereign wealth fund, two sources said. \"It's going to be a truly earth-shattering and positive development for this country and for the people of this country,\" he said in the Oval Office on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has not determined how proceeds from the sovereign wealth fund would be spent, sources said. In the past, he has suggested the fund could own a stake in TikTok, the popular social media platform that faces a U.S. ban unless China-based parent company ByteDance divests from it.",
      "Sovereign wealth funds typically invest assets from a country's natural resources with an aim to make returns that would provide a public windfall. Some of the best-known funds are financed by revenue from gas or oil, including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund and Norway's sovereign wealth fund. These funds can help insulate countries from swings in the value of natural resources, provide funds for government expenditures and allow future generations to benefit from current oil and gas revenue.",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order that directed the Treasury and Commerce secretaries, in close coordination with the National Economic Council's Kevin Hassett, to draft a plan for the sovereign wealth fund within 90 days.",
      "\"Such plan shall include recommendations for funding mechanisms, investment strategies, fund structure, and a governance model,\" the order stated. \"The plan shall also include an evaluation of the legal considerations for establishing and managing such a fund, including any need for legislation.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-maha-food-box-replace-csfp-low-income-seniors/",
    "published": "Wed, 07 May 2025 17:31:06 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has a new plan to get \"healthy\" food to low-income seniors, but an anti-hunger advocate fears many will miss out.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's proposed budget for next year could include big changes for a small food aid program that helps low-income senior citizens supplement their diets. Under the plan, funding for the program \u2014 called the Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP) \u2014 would be cut, and seniors instead would receive what the Trump administration is calling \"MAHA food boxes\" filled with products sourced directly from farmers.",
      "The food boxes \u2014 whose name stems from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s pledge to \"Make America Healthy Again\" \u2014 could eventually also be rolled out to either \"supplant or complement current USDA programs,\" the U.S. Department of Agriculture told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The agency didn't disclose what other government programs could integrate use of the MAHA food boxes.",
      "The USDA administers the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, more commonly known as food stamps. The agency also oversees other food aid programs such as Women, Infants and Children, which is aimed at pregnant women and kids, as well as the National School Lunch program.",
      "\"Unlike the current approach using food banks, which provide those in need with shelf-stable foods that are high in sodium and other harmful ingredients, MAHA boxes would be filled with commodities sourced from domestic farmers and given directly to American households,\" the Trump budget proposal notes.",
      "The CSFP helps about 730,000 low-income seniors annually through its $389 million budget, according to the USDA. By comparison, the food-stamp program spent about $100 billion last year to provide assistance to 41 million Americans, according to the USDA.",
      "\"We have no details\"",
      "The CSFP is essential for low-income seniors who are struggling to put food on the table, said George Matysik, executive director of Share Food Program, a nonprofit\u00a0in Philadelphia. He expressed concern about the Trump administration's plans to replace the CSFP with food boxes, noting the logistical complexity of getting perishable food from farmers directly to older Americans.",
      "Another question is whether the foods included in the food boxes would meet the needs of seniors who often need shelf-stable foods because many struggle to get to the store, Matysik said.",
      "\"What we do know is that the program that we currently have is working, and seniors have come to rely on us,\" he said. \"We have no details [about logistics of the MAHA food boxes], and this has been a continued challenge that we've had with this administration, where decisions are sort of made overnight.\"",
      "Share Food Program relies on $4.5 million in CSFP funding to provide 32-pound food boxes to more than 7,000 seniors in the Philadelphia region who earn less than roughly $23,000 per year. Matysik disagreed with the Trump administration's claims that the program provides unhealthy foods to seniors, noting the boxes typically contain products such as canned vegetables, lean proteins and pastas.",
      "\"For seniors, a lot of times it can be hard to make it out to the grocery store \u2014 it can be hard to get those core items that folks need,\" he added. \"What we do at Share Food Program is take it directly to the doorstep of about 4,500 seniors, so not only are we providing that nutrition, but we're making it easy on the seniors.\"",
      "The Trump budget proposal represents a wish list for the current administration, and it isn't certain that funding for the CSFP would be cut.",
      "But the plan comes amid a larger push by the Trump administration to reduce spending on similar programs, such as a decision in March to cut two federal programs that provided about $1 billion in funding to schools and food banks and instead have them source food directly from local farms, ranchers and producers.",
      "The Kennedy effect",
      "The MAHA food boxes would provide a twofold benefit, the USDA said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"MAHA boxes would be more wholesome foods, and similar to the Farmers to Families Food Box, fresh foods,\" the agency said. It added that \"the most obvious\" benefit would be \"the removal of administrative middlemen from the distribution of food.\"",
      "The Farmers to Families Food Box, a pandemic food program that ran from May 2020 to May 2021, relied on more than 200 contractors to deliver millions of boxes to needy families, according to a 2021 analysis from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. The study found that the 21 biggest contractors were collectively awarded $3 billion to deliver the boxes.",
      "MAHA, meanwhile, is part of a push by Kennedy to promote natural foods and alternative medicines. As head of HHS, he's pressing the food industry to stop using\u00a0synthetic food dyes\u00a0and has pledged to remove processed foods from school lunches.",
      "The USDA has signaled its openness to the MAHA platform, with Secretary Brooke Rollins saying she plans to approve a plan from Arkansas to ban the use of food stamps for purchasing sodas and candy. Anti-hunger advocates have said such restrictions can be stigmatizing for low-income Americans.",
      "In the meantime, Matysik said he's worried about the future of the CSFP program and the seniors who rely on it.",
      "\"Our seniors in particular are already hurting,\" he said. \"We're hearing about cuts to the SNAP program. We're seeing about cuts to Medicaid and Medicare. We're really worried about our senior citizens in this funding environment from our federal government right now.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are rebelling against a crypto regulation bill, putting the first-of-its-kind legislation in jeopardy ahead of a possible key vote on it later this week.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but has since bled Democratic support amid concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency.",
      "The bill passed through the committee weeks before the announcement earlier this month that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm will invest billions of dollars in a Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial. The deal involves the firm buying $2 billion worth of a stablecoin offered by World Liberty Financial, and using it to invest in crypto exchange Binance.",
      "The news set off alarm bells for Democrats, who are now pushing for legislation that bans elected officials and their families from buying or selling crypto assets, including stablecoins.",
      "Last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, told his members that they should not commit to voting for the GENIUS Act as a way to leverage changes, according to a source familiar with the discussions. Talks between Republicans and Democrats about potential changes are ongoing.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, has signaled openness to modifications, but told reporters Tuesday \"we need to start moving forward.\" A procedural vote is expected Thursday, despite the opposition, and needs at least 60 votes.",
      "Democratic Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, said the stablecoin bill advanced out of the committee with the caveat that improvements would be made before it was brought up for a floor vote. But Republicans moved ahead without addressing Democrats' concerns on provisions involving anti-money laundering, national security and consumer protections, Gallego said.",
      "\"I think the purpose of that was really to put Democrats in a bad position and try to force us to vote for it,\" Gallego told MeidasTouch in an interview posted Wednesday.",
      "\"You can't try to f*** us and then say, hey, deal with it,\" Gallego added. \"That's just not going to work, especially when you still need our votes.\"",

      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, has circulated a fact sheet to all Senate Democrats laying out how she says the stablecoin bill falls short on safeguarding against corruption, as well as protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "The fact sheet's lead recommendation is for elected officials and their families to be barred from owning, buying, selling or otherwise participating in stablecoin business ventures.",
      "\"Congress is writing laws that will sharply increase or decrease the value of stablecoin businesses, and the public should know that no one is making decisions to further their own financial interests, including the President of the United States. The current version of the GENIUS Act contains no such restrictions,\" it says.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Warren said, \"Democrats who both support and oppose the GENIUS Act agree that green lighting Donald Trump's corrupt stablecoin deals is wrong. We need to make sure we fix this in the bill, or else the GENIUS Act will simply facilitate Trump's crypto corruption.\"",
      "The request aligns with a separate bill introduced by Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon on Tuesday. The bill, titled the End Crypto Corruption Act, would prohibit the president, vice president, members of Congress, senior officials in the Executive Branch and their immediate families from financially benefiting from crypto assets.",
      "\"Currently, people who wish to cultivate influence with the president can enrich him personally by buying cryptocurrency he owns or controls,\" Merkley said in a statement. \"This is a profoundly corrupt scheme. It endangers our national security and erodes public trust in government. Let's end this corruption immediately.\"",

      "The Trump family's venture into crypto products has increased their wealth by billions in the last six months, according to a recent report, as his administration continues to loosen the federal government's regulatory approach to the digital currency industry as a whole.",
      "The president's crypto holdings now represent nearly 40% of his net worth \u2014 or approximately $2.9 billion. That increase is due in part to his release of the $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins, in addition to a large stake in World Liberty Financial, which launched in October 2024.",
      "In response to the criticism, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly told CBS News in a statement that Mr. Trump's \"assets are in a trust managed by his children, and there are no conflicts of interest.\"",
      "\"Stablecoin legislation should be passed on a bipartisan basis. President Trump is dedicated to making America the crypto capital of the world and revolutionizing our digital financial technology,\" she said.",

The news was earlier reported by CNN.",
      "The slides were also confirmed by a union representing government employees, which said the workers were told at the meeting that the Energy Star program would be eliminated.",

      "Energy Star was created in 1992 under President George H.W. Bush with the idea of helping consumers save money while reducing energy consumption. Its blue stickers on appliances, inform shoppers that those products meet energy efficiency standards set by the EPA. During his first term, President Trump had sought to close the Energy Star program, but the effort was abandoned after pushback from appliance manufacturers and lawmakers in both parties.",

The administration wants to boost fossil fuel and mineral extraction on U.S. lands, part of its goal to battle inflation.",
      "Appliances are part of that push. Mr. Trump has pledged to \"unleash America's affordable and reliable energy and natural resources,\" according to an executive order he signed in January, which ordered a review of \"restrictions on consumer choice of vehicles and appliances.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Kamler family, owner of Fairfield, New Jersey-based Kent International, has been in the bicycle business for four generations.",
      "\"When I joined the company in 1972, we had six employees, including both my parents and myself,\" former Kent International CEO Arnold Kamler told CBS News. \"And as of a few months ago we had over 200 employees.\"",
      "Arnold took over Kent International from his father. Now his son, Scott Kamler, is CEO. They sell about two million bikes per year in the U.S. and they're one of Walmart's biggest suppliers. But President Trump's plan for tariffs is throwing a wrench into their American dream.",
      "About 90% of Kent bikes are imported from China. The rest are assembled in the U.S. at their factory in South Carolina with parts from Asia. Kent had been paying 25% tariffs on bikes and bike parts coming from China since the first Trump administration. But under the tariffs implemented by Mr. Trump last month, a recent shipment that was delayed and arrived during the new tariff period forced the company to pay a combined 181.47% in import duties and tariffs.",
      "During the one-month period from March 20 to April 20, Kent Bikes paid $3.1 million in tariffs alone.",
      "Under the new tariffs, a bicycle wheel imported from China that would have previously cost between $10 and $12 increased to about $30, according to Arnold.",
      "He says that makes him feel \"really bad\" and \"angry.\"",
      "\"China is not paying these tariffs,\" Arnold said. \"We have an account with U.S. customs where they automatically deduct once a month, the import duty, from our account. And so, it's not only import duty, but these tariffs are deducted.\"",
      "The company cancelled its new orders from China for April, and it doesn't have any plans to place new orders in May.",
      "Even if tariffs against China are reduced by the Trump administration, there are dozens of other countries facing new tariffs. So trying to find other foreign vendors seems futile.",
      "\"We had already shifted some of our business, almost half our business, to several of the countries on that list,\" Kamler   said. \"And we're getting out of China and now we're still getting slammed. It's just completely unfair.\"",
      "Arnold indicates that fully manufacturing and assembling their bikes in the U.S. is not financially tenable from a cost-perspective.",
      "\"I can't even calculate that high,\" Kamler   said about what he thinks a bike would cost to produce here. \"I'll just tell you one quick story. There was a company that came to us a couple years ago. They wanted to make handlebars for us. Now we used to make our own handlebar for about a dollar-and- a-half, and we saved some money by buying it from Asia. And this company took three months to give me the quotation for a simple BMX handlebar. And the price came back at $12. I said, '$12? It's about 80 cents of steel. How could you be?' 'Well, there's a lot of work.' And I said, 'OK, thank you, you can lose my number.'

    "summary": "Many investments Mr. Trump claims credit for predate his return to office or are based on vague future pledges. Here's a fact check of his claims.",
    "story": [
      "After President Trump was pressed on rising consumer prices and slowing economic growth, he defended his tariff policies by claiming they had spurred record investment in the United States.",
      "\"I think we probably have close to $9 trillion of investments coming into this country,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on\u00a0NBC's Meet the Press that aired Sunday. \"If you look at other presidents, there's never been anything like that.\"",
      "He has also repeatedly claimed that he secured more investment in his first two months than President Biden did in four years.",
      "Neither claim is supported by evidence, CBS News Confirmed found. While companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in planned investments since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, the White House has not provided data showing the total approaches $9 trillion.",
      "Additionally, a CBS News review found that some investments highlighted by the White House were announced before Mr. Trump's reelection. The comparison to the Biden administration is also misleading: the president is citing future investments pledges, while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects that were in the works or completed by the end of his predecessor's term.",
      "Here's a breakdown of the claims.",
      "Some investments Trump claims credit for were announced under Biden",
      "The White House on April 29 said Mr. Trump had secured $5 trillion of U.S. investment in his first 100 days, and published a partial list titled \"The Trump Effect\" \u2014 which it said demonstrated \"his America First economic policies have sparked trillions of dollars in new investment.\"",
      "That list totals closer to $2 trillion from private companies, and around $5 trillion if commitments from foreign countries are included. The basis for the president's $9 trillion claim is unclear and the administration has not explained the discrepancy.",
      "A closer look at the White House list also shows some of the investments had been announced before Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The list initially included a $4.1 billion commitment from Novelis, a Georgia-based aluminum company, to build a plant in southern Alabama. But construction for that project began in October 2022 and the $4.1 billion total investment was detailed in the company's February 2024 financial report. CBS News asked the White House on May 5 why the project was included; the administration did not answer the question, but by midday May 6 the project had been removed from the website.",
      "The Trump administration also claimed credit for a $1.5 billion pledge by Corning to invest in its solar products facility in Michigan. A company spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that $900 million of this funding was announced months before Mr. Trump assumed office. On April 29, Corning announced an additional $600 million investment, bringing the total to $1.5 billion.",
      "Likewise, the White House listed Johnson & Johnson's commitment to spend $55 billion over the next four years, but a company spokesperson confirmed that total includes a $2 billion investment \u2014 announced last October \u2014 in a facility in Wilson, North Carolina.",
      "The list also includes the Stargate Project, a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative announced by Open AI and Japan-based Softbank on Jan. 21, which had been in development for at least a year before Mr. Trump's inauguration. The companies said $100 billion would be deployed \"immediately,\" but offered few specifics on how or where the money would be spent.",
      "Comparing to investments under Biden",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he attracted more investment in two months than Biden did in four years, suggesting he brought in trillions in a matter of weeks while casting doubt that the former president secured even $1 trillion during his term.",
      "But there's no clear evidence to support his claim. A White House spokesperson said the president was referring to a December 2024 report from the Biden White House, which said the private sector committed at least $1 trillion to clean energy and manufacturing projects during Biden's term.",
      "However, Biden's list of investments highlighted \"a selection of private-sector investments in 21st century industries\" including green energy, semiconductors, and pharmaceuticals, based on project announcements in specific locations or factories under construction. The data on Biden's \"Investing in America\" spreadsheet also showed projects that closely resemble some on Mr. Trump's list.",
      "By comparison, the Trump administration's list includes broader, less specific investment pledges across a variety of industries \u2014 many without clear timelines or locations.",
      "For example, Mr. Trump's list highlights Apple's recent $500 billion pledge to U.S. manufacturing and training. However, as previously reported by The Washington Post, Apple also announced a $430 billion investment early in Biden's term, including a North Carolina engineering hub that was paused in 2024, and the Biden administration's report does not include any Apple investments in its tally.",
      "However, experts caution that announcements about planned investments don't guarantee action.",
      "\"Companies often will make announcements to essentially curry favor with an incoming administration to show how committed they are to the United States,\" said Nick Nigro, the founder of Atlas Public Policy, which tracks clean energy investment in the U.S. \"It's not unusual whether it was President Trump or President Biden or President Obama.\"",
      "Presidents from both parties have claimed credit for projects started under their predecessors. For instance, pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced investments during Mr. Trump's first term, some of which contributed to the construction of manufacturing facilities highlighted by the Biden White House investment report.",
      "During his term, Biden signed major pieces of legislation, including the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, which included $24 billion in tax credits to attract private investors in hopes of driving domestic manufacturing commitments.",
      "Such incentives may continue to fuel further projects during Mr. Trump's term, according to Nigro, provided they remain in place \u2014 but the long-term impact of federal policy, including under both Biden and Mr. Trump, may take years to assess.",
      "\"It's very hard to attach these new investments that have been announced as being tied directly to policies of the Trump administration. It's frankly just too early,\" Nigro said.",

      "\"They are terminating people's financial lives,\" O'Malley said.",
      "Though it's just one of the things advocates and lawyers worry about, these erroneous deaths come after a pair of initiatives from new leadership at the SSA to alter or update its databases of the living and the dead.",
      "Holders of millions of Social Security numbers have been marked as deceased. Separately, according to The Washington Post and The New York Times, thousands of numbers belonging to immigrants have been purged, cutting them off from banks and commerce, in an effort to encourage these people to \"self-deport.\"",
      "Glasgow said SSA employees received an agency email in April about the purge, instructing them how to resurrect beneficiaries wrongly marked dead. \"Why don't you just do due diligence to make sure what you're doing in the first place is correct?\" he said.",
      "The incorrectly marked deaths are just a piece of the Trump administration's crash program purporting to root out fraud, modernize technology, and secure the program's future.",
      "But KFF Health News' interviews with more than a dozen beneficiaries, advocates, lawyers, current and former employees, and lawmakers suggest the overhaul is making the agency worse at its primary job: sending checks to seniors, orphans, widows, and those with disabilities.",
      "Philadelphian Lisa Seda, who has cancer, has been struggling for weeks to sort out her 24-year-old niece's difficulties with Social Security's disability insurance program. There are two problems: first, trying to change her niece's address; second, trying to figure out why the program is deducting roughly $400 a month for Medicare premiums, when her disability lawyer \u2014 whose firm has a policy against speaking on the record \u2014 believes they could be zero.",
      "Since March, sometimes Social Security has direct-deposited payments to her niece's bank account and other times mailed checks to her old address. Attempting to sort that out has been a morass of long phone calls on hold and in-person trips seeking an appointment.",
      "Before 2025, getting the agency to process changes was usually straightforward, her lawyer said. Not anymore.",
      "The need is dire. If the agency halts the niece's disability payments, \"then she will be homeless,\" Seda recalled telling an agency employee. \"I don't know if I'm going to survive this cancer or not, but there is nobody else to help her.\"",
      "Some of the problems are technological. According to whistleblower information provided to Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, the agency's efforts to process certain data have been failing more frequently. When that happens, \"it can delay or even stop payments to Social Security recipients,\" the committee recently told the agency's inspector general.",
      "While tech experts and former Social Security officials warn about the potential for a complete system crash, day-to-day decay can be an insidious and serious problem, said Kathleen Romig, formerly of the Social Security Administration and its advisory board and currently the director of Social Security and disability policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Beneficiaries could struggle to get appointments or the money they're owed, she said.",
      "For its more than 70 million beneficiaries nationwide, Social Security is crucial. More than a third of recipients said they wouldn't be able to afford necessities if the checks stopped coming, according to a January survey from the National Academy of Social Insurance.",
      "Advocates and lawyers say lately Social Security is failing to deliver, to a degree that's nearly unprecedented in their experience.",
      "Carolyn Villers, executive director of the Massachusetts Senior Action Council, said two of her members' March payments were several days late. \"For one member that meant not being able to pay rent on time,\" she said. \"The delayed payment is not something I've heard in the last 20 years.\"",
      "When KFF Health News presented the agency with questions, Social Security officials passed them off to the White House. White House spokesperson Elizabeth Huston referred to Mr. Trump's \"resounding mandate\" to make government more efficient.",
      "\"He has promised to protect social security, and every recipient will continue to receive their benefits,\" Huston said in an email. She did not provide specific, on-the-record responses to questions.",
      "Complaints about missed payments are mushrooming. The Arizona attorney general's office had received approximately 40 complaints related to delayed or disrupted payments by early April, spokesperson Richie Taylor told KFF Health News.",
      "A Connecticut agency assisting people on Medicare said complaints related to Social Security \u2014 which often helps administer payments and enroll patients in the government insurance program primarily for those over age 65 \u2014 had nearly doubled in March compared with last year.",
      "Lawyers representing beneficiaries say that, while the historically underfunded agency has always had its share of errors and inefficiencies, it's getting worse as experienced employees have been let go.",
      "\"We're seeing more mistakes being made,\" said James Ratchford, a lawyer in West Virginia with 17 years' experience representing Social Security beneficiaries. \"We're seeing more things get dropped.\"",
      "What gets dropped, sometimes, are records of basic transactions. Kim Beavers of Independence, Missouri, tried to complete a periodic ritual in February: filling out a disability update form saying she remains unable to work. But her scheduled payments in March and April didn't show.",
      "She got an in-person appointment to untangle the problem \u2014 only to be told there was no record of her submission, despite her showing printouts of the relevant documents to the agency representative. Beavers has a new appointment scheduled for May, she said.",
      "Social Security employees frequently cite missing records to explain their inability to solve problems when they meet with lawyers and beneficiaries. A disability lawyer whose firm's policy does not allow them to be named had a particularly puzzling case: One client, a longtime Social Security disability recipient, had her benefits reassessed. After winning on appeal, the lawyer went back to the agency to have the payments restored \u2014 the recipient had been going without since February. But there was nothing there.",
      "\"To be told they've never been paid benefits before is just chaos, right? Unconditional chaos,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Researchers and lawyers say they have a suspicion about what's behind the problems at Social Security: the Elon Musk-led effort to revamp the agency.",
      "Some 7,000 SSA employees have reportedly been let go; O'Malley has estimated that 3,000 more would leave the agency. \"As the workloads go up, the demoralization becomes deeper, and people burn out and leave,\" he predicted in an April hearing held by House Democrats. \"It's going to mean that if you go to a field office, you're going to see a heck of a lot more empty, closed windows.\"",
      "The departures have hit the agency's regional payment centers hard. These centers help process and adjudicate some cases. It's the type of behind-the-scenes work in which \"the problems surface first,\" Romig said. But if the staff doesn't have enough time, \"those things languish.\"",
      "Languishing can mean, in some cases, getting dropped by important programs like Medicare. Social Security often automatically deducts premiums, or otherwise administers payments, for the health program.",
      "Lately, Melanie Lambert, a senior advocate at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, has seen an increasing number of cases in which the agency determines beneficiaries owe money to Medicare. The cash is sent to the payment centers, she said. And the checks \"just sit there.\"",
      "Beneficiaries lose Medicare, and \"those terminations also tend to happen sooner than they should, based on Social Security's own rules,\" putting people into a bureaucratic maze, Lambert said.",
      "Employees' technology is more often on the fritz. \"There's issues every single day with our system. Every day, at a certain time, our system would go down automatically,\" said Glasgow, of Social Security's Schenectady office. Those problems began in mid-March, he said.",
      "The new problems leave Glasgow suspecting the worst. \"It's more work for less bodies, which will eventually hype up the inefficiency of our job and make us, make the agency, look as though it's underperforming, and then a closer step to the privatization of the agency,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "A judge temporarily barred the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies late Friday, part of a massive federal cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of federal employee unions \u2014 are likely to show that the Trump administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. Illston wrote that President Trump \"likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks.\"",
      "Illston's temporarily restraining order blocks a litany of federal agencies from taking any further steps to carry out a February executive order telling agencies to draw up plans for large-scale job cuts. The affected agencies \u2014 covering a wide swath of the government \u2014 can't continue laying off staff or put workers on administrative leave in order to comply with Mr. Trump's order. The order also blocks \"any further orders by DOGE to agencies to cut programs or staff\" in accordance with the executive order.",
      "The order will remain in effect for at least 14 days while the judge considers the case.",
      "It applies to DOGE and 20 federal agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget, the Social Security Administration and the departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, Veterans Affairs and more.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to dramatically reorganize the government and downsize the federal workforce \u2014 a gambit it argues is designed to cut bureaucratic bloat and save taxpayer money. But federal unions and Democratic lawmakers view the moves as unlawful and disruptive to public services. The effort is led by Musk, whose team at DOGE has become embedded in virtually every major federal agency.",
      "The administration has already laid off or offered buyouts to thousands of staff, often focusing on probationary workers who are relatively new to federal service. Plans for deeper cuts are in the works at some agencies.",
      "In February, the Office of Personnel Management \u2014 essentially the federal government's human resources arm \u2014 ordered government agencies to make plans for a \"significant reduction\" in the number of staff.",
      "The lawsuit that led to Friday's restraining order alleges these moves are an \"unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by the President of the United States on a scale unprecedented in this country's history and in clear excess of his authority.\"",
      "The suit argues Mr. Trump doesn't have the power to reorganize and slash federal agencies without authorization from Congress.",
      "The lawsuit also argues DOGE, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management don't have the legal authority to order sweeping government-wide cuts.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, writing in legal filings that \"Congress has expressly authorized federal agencies to engage in [reductions-in-force] and has done so for nearly 150 years.\" It notes the Trump administration's executive orders and memos specifically said agencies' cost-cutting plans should follow the law, and argues the administration provided \"broad guidance\" rather than dictating specific layoffs.",
      "Illston largely sided with the plaintiffs Friday, writing they are likely to show Mr. Trump, DOGE, OMB and OPM exceeded their authority. The judge also said the plaintiffs presented evidence that agencies have made cuts \"at the direction of the President and his team,\" rather than treating the administration's memos as general guidance.",
      "The Trump administration's cost-cutting drive has run into several other lawsuits. In March, a federal judge ordered the administration to rehire thousands of probationary workers. The Supreme Court later paused that ruling\u00a0while the litigation plays out.",

    "summary": "Rumeysa Ozturk was taken into custody on March 25 after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody Friday, hours after a judge ordered her to be freed on bail.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Sessions, who is presiding over the case, said at the conclusion of Friday's bail hearing that Ozturk raised \"very substantial\" and \"very significant\" claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when she was taken into custody following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa in March.",
      "\"Her continued detention cannot stand,\" he said.",
      "Ozturk was released by the government later Friday afternoon, one of her attorneys, Sonya Levitova, confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"The government sent masked, plainclothes agents to kidnap R\u00fcmeysa off the street and lock her up for writing an op-ed. She has been a political prisoner for six weeks. Now that she's free and can resume her studies and rejoin her community at Tufts, we look forward to seeing the government in court to vindicate R\u00fcmeysa's rights in full,\" Levitova said in a statement.",
      "Ozturk was held at an immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana, where she was transferred after she was detained in Massachusetts. But the court said she can now return to her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, with no travel restrictions. The bail hearing in her challenge to her confinement came after a\u00a0federal appeals court ruled\u00a0Wednesday that the Trump administration had until May 14 to comply with a district court's order to transfer Ozturk to immigration custody in Vermont.",
      "Ozturk, who appeared remotely from Louisiana and testified before the court, was seen hugging her lawyer after Sessions delivered his decision from the bench.",
      "The Trump administration has said that the underlying justification for taking Ozturk's student visa away rested on an opinion piece she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper last year about Israel's war with Hamas. But Sessions said Ozturk \"simply and purely\" was detained for \"the expression she made or shared in the op-ed.\"",
      "\"There has been no evidence that has been introduced by the government other than the op-ed. I mean, that literally is the case,\" Sessions said. \"There is no evidence here as to the motivation, absent the consideration of the op-ed.\"",
      "He told the court that creates a \"very significant, substantial claim that the op-ed \u2014 that is that the expression of one's opinion as ordinarily protected by the First Amendment \u2014 formed the basis of this particular detention.\"",
      "\"There is absolutely no evidence that she has engaged in violence or advocated violence,\" Sessions said. \"She has no criminal record. She has done nothing other than essentially attend her university and expand her contacts within the community in such a supportive way.\"",
      "Mike Rodman, a spokesperson for Tufts University, said in a statement that the school is \"pleased that the court has approved Rumeysa's request to be released on bail, and we look forward to welcoming her back to campus to resume her doctoral studies. As we have noted previously, Rumeysa is a student in good standing, and nothing in her co-authored op-ed of March 26, 2024, in The Tufts Daily student newspaper violated either the university's gatherings, protests, and demonstrations policy or its Declaration on Freedom of Expression. We hope that she is able to rejoin our community as soon as possible.\"",
      "In addition to hearing testimony from Ozturk, her lawyers also questioned her doctor, her adviser in the doctoral program at Tufts and an official with a Burlington, Vermont, organization that offered pretrial services to Ozturk if she is released. The government did not put forward any witnesses to provide testimony.",
      "During the proceedings, and while her doctor was testifying about Ozturk's asthma diagnosis, a lawyer appearing alongside her in Louisiana said Ozturk was suffering from an asthma attack, and she was briefly excused for 10 minutes.",
      "One of Ozturk's lawyers said that she would face \"significant health risks\" if she remained in detention and urged Sessions to immediately grant her bail.",
      "Allowing her to remain in custody shows that \"you can be detained thousands of miles from your home for more than six weeks for writing a single news article,\" her attorney told the court.",
      "Ozturk alleges that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights. She is among several hundred international students attending American universities who have had their student visas revoked after they were accused of criticizing Israel or participating in pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses.",
      "Ozturk's attorneys said that an immigration judge denied bond for the Turkish national during a hearing last month after they asked an immigration judge to release her as her immigration case proceeds. Her lawyers said the Department of Homeland Security presented one document to support their opposition to Ozturk's bond request: a one-paragraph State Department memo revoking her student visa.",
      "The immigration judge, Ozturk's attorneys said, denied bond based on the \"untenable conclusion\" that she was \"both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\"",
      "Ozturk was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities outside her Somerville residence on March 25 after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration. She was not informed about the revocation before she was detained, her lawyers said.",
      "As justification for her arrest and detention, the Department of Homeland Security and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ozturk \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization,'\" according to court filings.",
      "Ozturk had co-authored an opinion piece that was published in the Tufts' student newspaper last year that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed did not mention Hamas.",
      "Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk and supporting her motion regarding her release, writing that the university \"has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "After Ozturk was taken into custody, she was transferred to New Hampshire and then Vermont, where she was kept overnight before putting her on a plane to Louisiana. The 30-year-old student has been detained at an immigration facility in Basile since late March.",
      "In a court filing by Ozturk, she said that she has suffered multiple serious asthma attacks in ICE detention and has received limited medical attention at the Louisiana detention center. She said that she is one of 24 people in a detention cell that has a sign stating the room has a capacity for 14.",
      "During Friday's bail hearing, Ozturk told the court that she has suffered 12 asthma attacks since she was detained, which have become \"longer and harder to stop.\" Four of them occurred since Ozturk disclosed her history to the court in a declaration last week, she said. There are \"constant triggers\" that can bring on an attack, including the room conditions at the facility in Louisiana, limited access to the outdoors and stress from her confinement, Ozturk said.",
      "\"It is affecting me in a very negative way, alongside other women living here, not accessing enough medical care and medication,\" she said.",
      "If she is released while her case is adjudicated, Tufts will provide Ozturk with housing, she said. Ozturk can continue working toward completion of her doctorate if she is let out of detainment, she told the court.",
      "Ozturk's whereabouts in the hours after she was taken into custody kicked off a battle over where her habeas petition should be filed and whether federal district courts even have the authority to consider the challenge. While initially filed in court in Massachusetts, a judge there transferred her case to Vermont, given that Ozturk was in the state at the time her lawyers filed her habeas petition.",
      "The Massachusetts judge who was assigned Ozturk's petition seeking release had swiftly issued an order barring the government from transferring her out of the state. But by then, Ozturk was in Vermont and hours later was flown to Louisiana.",
      "Referencing this initial order, Sessions called it an \"extraordinary situation\" in which a federal judge ordered the government not to take Ozturk out of Massachusetts, and then did not inform the court that she was in a different location.",
      "The Justice Department had argued that the case should proceed in Louisiana, as that is where Ozturk was confined. They had sought, unsuccessfully, to have her challenge to her detention tossed out.",
      "Sessions, who sits on the federal district court in Vermont, ruled last month that Ozturk had to be transferred from Louisiana to ICE custody in Vermont. Separate from her bail hearing, the judge will weigh the merits of Ozturk's challenge to her confinement on May 22.",
      "The Trump administration appealed that decision and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit to block it. But the three-judge panel rejected the request and said federal immigration authorities had to transfer Ozturk to Vermont, as Sessions ordered them to do.",
      "\"Permitting Ozturk's transfer will provide her ready access to legal and medical services, address concerns about the conditions of her confinement, and expedite resolution of this matter \u2014 all of which are required, as the court below noted, to proceed expeditiously,\" Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan said in their unanimous opinion. \"At stake, too, is Ozturk's ability to participate meaningfully in her habeas proceedings.\"",

      "The two nations, which trade billions in goods each year, have been in a tense stand-off since last month when Mr. Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports. China retaliated with a 125% levy on American goods.",
      "The upcoming talks in Switzerland represent the first publicly announced meeting between the two nations since the trade war began. A spokesperson for the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the U.S. suggested in a\u00a0statement\u00a0Wednesday that the U.S. was the one to reach out and initiate talks.",

      "An analysis from UBS Global Wealth Management also suggests tariffs may dip further below the 80% Mr. Trump suggested.",

    "story": [
      "At least half a dozen USAID employees who spoke to reporters after they thought they had been fired by the Trump administration have now received notices from the foreign aid agency's internal human resources office that they are facing investigation for participating in interviews.",
      "The workers, whose formal dismissal date was delayed after leaders encountered bureaucratic snags, received an email in recent days carrying the subject line, \"Administrative inquiry.\" The email accused them of having \"engaged with the press/media without authorization\" and threatened \"disciplinary action\" including \"removal from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\"",
      "The emails were sent by Employment Labor Relations, which is part of the USAID's internal HR structure, and manages most disciplinary and performance complaints.",
      "\"It's total intimidation,\" said Randy Chester, the vice president of the American Foreign Service Association, which is the union that represents USAID employees. He said employees started receiving notices on Monday. The union shared the email exclusively with CBS.",
      "\"Federal employees do not surrender their constitutional rights when they take public service jobs,\" said Abbe Lowell, a veteran Washington, D.C., attorney who launched his own firm last week to protect public officials from retaliation. Lowell is known for representing high-profile political figures including Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump and Hunter Biden.",
      "\"This so-called 'inquiry' does not appear to be about enforcing any rules so much as it's trying to silence criticism,\" he said.",
      "USAID \u2014 the agency that oversaw distribution of foreign aid \u2014was among the first to face drastic personnel cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, a force reduction effort overseen by Elon Musk. On Feb. 2, Musk posted the following on X: \"USAID is a criminal organization. Time for it to die.\"",
      "Operating largely in secret, workers for DOGE were inserted into various federal agencies and proceeded to enact large-scale force reductions. In February, USAID employees received notices that they would soon lose their jobs. An agency letter dated Feb. 4 said \"all USAID direct hire personnel will be placed on administrative leave globally.\"\u00a0 A few days later, workers were informed that the agency headquarters were closed until further notice.",
      "On Feb. 18, President Trump gave a speech saying, \"we've effectively eliminated the U.S. Agency for International Development.\"",
      "At the end of the month, employees were given 15 minutes to pack up their belongings, in what many considered the end of their careers at USAID.",
      "But shuttering the agency was more difficult than anticipated, and many saw their dismissal date slide as their bosses worked to terminate them. In March, USAID leadership issued a memo saying the vast majority of the agency's employees would formally lose their jobs on either July 1 or Sept. 2.\u00a0 Employees have continued to be on USAID payroll since February.",
      "Later that month, the State Department notified Congress that it would \"realign select USAID functions to the Department\" by July 1.",
      "This week, employees who spoke out publicly about their dismissal between late February and early March began receiving email communication that suggested interviews done during this period were improper. The email, reviewed by CBS News, asked the employees to submit a statement and answer a series of questions by May 13.",
      "According to the email, \"failure to comply with these instructions and to provide a statement as requested would constitute misconduct,\" and their written statement will be \"used to determine whether misconduct occurred and what action, if any, is necessary to correct that behavior.\"",
      "Federal workers, including USAID employees, are contractually prohibited from doing interviews with the press without agency permission. The USAID employees have not been asked to sign separation agreements that prevent them from speaking with members of the press, according to Chester.",
      "In this case many who had received notices about employee termination dates believed they had already lost their jobs, Chester\u00a0said. Others were willing to take the risk.",
      "He believes these notices promote a \"chilling effect\" for those who have stories to share with the press or have joined lawsuits against the government.",
      "\"It's an effort to stifle anyone else from talking to the press,\" he said in an interview with CBS News. \"These notices smack of an administration desperate to hide their mistakes.\"",
      "Investigations into possible employee misconduct typically take months to resolve and involve multiple appeals. In most circumstances, if an employee is found to have committed misconduct, they are offered a limited suspension from work without pay.",
      "\"This is a complete waste of time and government resources,\" Chester said. \"It's going to cost them money to conduct these investigations, and the lawyers investigating won't even have jobs by the time it's done.\"",
      "A State Department spokesperson responded to CBS' inquiry saying, \"as a general matter, we do not comment on internal personnel matters.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is \"actively looking at\" the possibility of suspending the writ of habeas corpus to handle people the administration says aren't in the country legally, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller said Friday.",
      "A writ of habeas corpus requires authorities to produce in court an individual they are holding and justify their confinement. Article I of the Constitution says the \"privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.\"",
      "Miller made the comments to reporters at the White House Friday when a journalist asked if President Trump is weighing the possibility of suspending habeas corpus to handle illegal immigration.",
      "\"Well, the Constitution is clear \u2014 and that, of course, is the supreme law of the land \u2014 that the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus can be suspended in a time of invasion,\" Miller said. \"So it's an option we're actively looking at. Look, a lot of it depends on whether the courts do the right thing or not.\"",
      "The Trump administration is fighting multiple lawsuits over its handling of undocumented immigrants, including migrants it flew to El Salvador for imprisonment. Mr. Trump has flouted the idea that all people suspected of being in the country illegally should receive hearings or trials, and has criticized federal courts and judges for getting in the way of the deportation process.",
      "\"We cannot give everyone a trial, because to do so would take, without exaggeration, 200 years,\" the president said in a social media post in April.",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration have previously cast illegal immigration as an invasion: The government deported undocumented immigrants to El Salvador using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law that allows for deportations when the United States is subject to an invasion by a foreign government.\u00a0 Some judges have pushed back on the argument.",
      "The writ of habeas corpus has been suspended only a handful of times in the U.S. and its territories since the Constitution was ratified. It was suspended across the states during the entire Civil War; in counties in South Carolina that were overrun by the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction; in specific places in the Philippines during an insurrection in 1905; and in Hawaii following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It has never been suspended in the U.S. to handle illegal immigration.",
      "Although habeas corpus is in the Constitution, it's a legal doctrine that dates back well beyond the country's founding. The term \"habeas corpus\" is Latin for \"you shall have the body,\" hence the requirement that the incarcerated person be physically brought before a judge in court.",

The order urges oil and gas expansion through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allows the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",
      "Those kinds of steps are supposed to be reserved for actual emergencies, such as projects needed in the aftermath of disasters like hurricanes, flooding or major oil spills, the attorneys general wrote in the lawsuit filed in Washington state Friday.",
      "But now, the 15\u00a0plaintiff states allege, agencies like the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Interior are bypassing required reviews under federal laws like the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act. The states argue an improper permitting process \"will result in significant and irreparable harm to state natural and historic resources and the people and biota that rely on those resources for drinking, farming, recreating, and habitat.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers pushed back on the lawsuit in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"The President of the United States has the authority to determine what is a national emergency, not state attorneys or the courts. President Trump recognizes that unleashing American energy is crucial to both our economic and national security,\" Rogers wrote.",

      "\"Obfuscation, delay, undermining,\" Richardson continued, referencing tactics he believed a fraction of FEMA staff might try to subvert his agenda. \"If you're one of those 20% of the people and you think those tactics and techniques are going to help you, they will not, because I will run right over you. I will achieve the president's intent.\"",
      "Richardson's formal title is Senior Official Performing the Duties of FEMA Administrator. He was named to the role Thursday and has not been formally nominated nor confirmed by the U.S. Senate.",
      "\"I can't recall the full title, but essentially, I'm acting,\" Richardson told staff on Friday, \"I don't need the full title. All I need is the authority from the president to put me in here as some degree of acting and I will make sure that his intent gets completed. I don't stop at yield signs,\" he continued.",
      "\"I, and I alone in FEMA, speak for FEMA,\" Richardson said.",
      "FEMA did not reply to a request for comment. When told about Richardson's meeting, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin responded, \"sounds like a productive first meeting.\"",
      "Richardson was appointed to lead FEMA after Cameron Hamilton, the former acting administrator, was fired Thursday morning, one day after publicly breaking with the Trump administration's expressed intent to eliminate the nation's disaster relief agency.",
      "\"I do not believe it is in the best interests of the American people to eliminate the Federal Emergency Management Agency,\" Hamilton testified Tuesday before a House Appropriations Committee hearing on Capitol Hill. His dismissal comes roughly three weeks before the start of the Atlantic hurricane season.",
      "White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Friday that Hamilton was fired for testifying \"contrary to the president,\" presumably when he advocated for the nation's disaster relief agency not to be eliminated.",
      "President Trump said shortly after taking office that he planned to \"begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA, or maybe getting rid of FEMA,\" criticizing the agency for allegedly responding slowly to natural disasters.",
      "In his first address as acting head of the agency, Richardson doubled down on the president's promise to reduce its scope and carry out the will of Mr. Trump.",
      "\"I am as bent on achieving the President's intent as I was on making sure that I did my duty, where I took my Marines to Iraq, eleven of them,\" Richardson was recorded as telling FEMA employees.",
      "According to his official biography posted by the Department of Homeland Security, the former Marine commanded artillery units, serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa. Richardson also taught history at George Washington University, strategy at the U.S. Army Field Artillery School, and Marine Corps Martial Arts.",
      "During his roughly 17-minute speech to FEMA employees, he recalled sending home a member of the Second Marine Division from Iraq. \"I had too important of a mission for anybody to undermine me or to make things difficult,\" Richardson said.",
      "\"We're going to find out how to push things down to the states,\" the acting leader later added. \"That should be done at the state level. Also going to find out how we can do more cost sharing with the states.\"",
      "During his address to FEMA employees, Richardson described his leadership style at length, noting that coworkers will rarely see him sitting behind his desk. \"Most of this time I will sit at the table drinking tea while I'm working out something with a stubby pencil,\" Richardson said, pointing a sharpened pencil into the air from behind a FEMA podium, according to the video of the recording.",
      "Richardson told FEMA employees, \"I have never read a book on leadership,\" but contended that, \"I'm fine operating in chaos and a very ambiguous environment.\"",
      "Toward the end of his remarks, the acting FEMA head referred all staff to two memos he authored in recent weeks, and distributed Friday morning. \"They're very short, but they will require almost all of you in this room input to some degree or another,\" Richardson said.",
      "According to the memos, obtained by CBS News, Richardson has directed staff to provide a slew of internal memos to him assessing FEMA's preparedness for 2025, as well as organization charts, watchdog reports and a list of all known gaps in the agency's preparedness or core capabilities.",
      "Richardson declined to take any questions from employees during his day one remarks, instead promising to host a town hall in the coming weeks so that employees could play, \"stump the chump.\"",
      "\"It's not that I'm afraid of questions, but I want you to read the memos,\" said Richardson.",
      "FEMA's new acting administrator said that he will begin his first day by \"looking at all the laws and statutes that guide FEMA and making sure that we are only doing the things that are within the law.\" He added, \"If we're not doing that, we are wasting the American taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "Reflecting on his time in the Marine Corps, Richardson paused for a moment. \"I've had friends who are either dead, physically or very damaged emotionally because they ran into trouble doing things that were not within their mission during combat.

    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 17:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says a new U.S. trade pact with the U.K. can serve as the basis for more trade deals. Economists say that could be a problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday hailed his new trade pact with the U.K. as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term.",
      "Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\"",
      "While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed on other nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank.",
      "Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say.",
      "\"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\"",
      "That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said.",
      "\"Modest improvement\"",
      "The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but \u2014 with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization \u2014 remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email.",
      "The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising the chances of a recession due to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled and U.S. Treasury prices slid in the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth.",
      "Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the new\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0with the U.K.",
      "While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In a recent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains.",
      "\"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\"",
      "Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle.",
      "\"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation \u2014 even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out.",
      "\"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\"",
      "Key meeting with China",
      "The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level.",
      "\"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" the president wrote\u00a0Friday morning.",
      "But that might not be enough to cushion the U.S. from the headwinds of higher tariffs, according to experts.",
      "\"Even if we were to see a continuation of the universal 10% tariff applied and some rollback of higher levels, or in the case of China, 145%, we're still talking about a tariff rate that is the highest since World War II,\" Luschini said. \"And so it's going to have an impact at some form.\"",

      "\"Therefore, I respectfully urge Congress to increase or suspend the debt limit by mid-July, before its scheduled break, to protect the full faith and credit of the United States,\" Bessent said.",
      "The so-called \"X-date\" marks when the government could run out of borrowing power and face an unprecedented default without action from Congress to address the debt limit, which caps how much the Treasury can borrow to pay the government's obligations.",
      "Lawmakers are pursuing a massive legislative package to enact President Trump's agenda while addressing the debt ceiling. And while GOP leaders have aimed to get the measure to the president's desk in the coming weeks, setting their own deadlines to do so, the X-date has widely been seen as the real deadline and most serious motivator.",
      "The debt ceiling was last addressed in 2023, when Congress suspended it until Jan. 1, 2025, under the Fiscal Responsibility Act. Since January, the Treasury Department has been using \"extraordinary measures\" to pay its bills and extend the date when it will run out of money.",
      "Bessent warned that a \"failure to suspend or increase the debt limit would wreak havoc on our financial system and diminish America's security and global leadership position.\"",
      "And he noted waiting until the last minute to address the debt limit \"can have serious adverse consequences for financial markets, business, and the federal government.\"",
      "The U.S. national debt currently stands at more than $36 trillion, and raising the debt limit doesn't greenlight new spending, but allows the government to pay what it already owes.",
      "The assessment comes after an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimated in March that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August, while noting that if the government's borrowing needs are \"significantly greater\" than projections, the Treasury Department's resources could be exhausted as early as late May or June.",

      "\"The Department's instructional materials should be mission-focused and not promote divisive concepts and gender ideology,\" Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement.",
      "Military leaders must identify any library materials at their educational institutions that are \"potentially incompatible with this core mission\" and \"appropriately sequester those materials\" by May 21, according to the order.

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to soon receive the first group of White South Africans it says deserve a safe haven in the U.S. because of alleged racial discrimination in post-Apartheid South Africa, government documents obtained by CBS News show.",
      "The initial arrival of the South African nationals who have been granted refugee status could happen as early as next week, according to the documents, which describe the effort as a \"stated priority\" for the Trump administration. Officials have planned a Monday press event at Dulles International Airport in Virginia to welcome the group, the documents show, although sources familiar with the effort told CBS News the timing of the plan could change.",
      "In February, President Trump issued an executive order directing officials to use the U.S. refugee program to resettle Afrikaners, an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European colonists, mostly from the Netherlands.",
      "The president claimed that Afrikaners faced \"government-sponsored race-based discrimination,\" citing a law that U.S. conservatives, like South African-born Elon Musk, have said allow racially motivated seizures of land owned by White South Africans. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination.",
      "The hastily arranged initiative to welcome Afrikaners stands in stark contrast to the Trump administration's move to ban most other refugees from entering the U.S.",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions after returning to the White House was suspending the American refugee admissions program, stranding thousands of approved refugees who had been identified as vulnerable individuals fleeing violence and persecution in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world.",
      "Federal courts have ruled against Mr. Trump's plan to shutter the refugee program, which Congress created in 1980 to offer refuge to those fleeing persecution because of their race, religion or political views. A federal judge recently ordered officials to resettle the approximately 12,000 refugees who were ready to travel to the U.S. when the refugee program was paused in January.",
      "The processing of Afrikaners granted refugee status has also been unusually fast. Before Mr. Trump's second term, the State Department said the refugee process, on average, took between 18 to 24 months to complete due to background checks, medical screenings and other interviews. The Afrikaners ready to travel to the U.S. have gone through that process in a matter of months or even weeks.",
      "While the State Department's long-standing program to assist refugees during their first months in the U.S. has been halted due to Mr. Trump's actions, his administration has instructed resettlement officials to use Department of Health and Human Services funds to aid the Afrikaners.",
      "The government documents show resettlement officials were told they can use funds administered by HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement to help Afrikaners secure housing, household items and basic necessities during their first 90 days in America, including \"groceries, weather-appropriate clothing, diapers, formula, hygiene products, and prepaid phones.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed in a statement on Friday that its Office of Refugee Resettlement is using \"existing infrastructure and funding\" to offer \"immediate support\" to Afrikaners.",
      "\"Initial arrivals are expected in the near term, with additional individuals anticipated over the coming months,\" the department said. \"(The Office of Refugee Resettlement) is coordinating closely with federal, state, and local partners to ensure these refugees receive the services needed to safely and successfully integrate within our country.\"",
      "In a statement, the State Department said the American Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, has been interviewing those who have applied for resettlement to the U.S. under Mr. Trump's directive to welcome Afrikaners and that it continues to receive inquiries.",

      "Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit in her daily press briefing, but did not provide details on the suit.",
      "Mexico's foreign relations ministry had previously sent letters to Google asking it not to label Mexican territorial waters as the Gulf of America. Mexico argues the new label should only apply to the part of the Gulf over the United States' continental shelf.",

      "As it stands, the gulf appears in Google Maps as Gulf of America within the United States, as Gulf of Mexico within Mexico and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America) elsewhere. Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \"longstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions.\"",
      "Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",

      "The executive order only carries authority within the U.S., and Mexico and other countries do not need to recognize the name change. The U.S. and Mexico both have coastlines along the Gulf, and a State Department report from the 1970s said the maritime boundary between the two countries begins at the center of the mouth of the Rio Grande and runs in a fixed line.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter, who was a steady member of the high court's liberal wing during his tenure despite being appointed by a Republican president, died Thursday. He was 85.",
      "The Supreme Court said Souter \"died peacefully\" at his home.",
      "\"Justice David Souter served our court with great distinction for nearly twenty years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said in a statement. \"After retiring to his beloved New Hampshire in 2009, he continued to render significant service to our branch by sitting regularly on the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit for more than a decade. He will be greatly missed.\"",
      "Appointed in 1990 to replace Justice William Brennan, Souter was a little-known judge on the U.S. appellate court in Boston when he was selected by then-President George H.W. Bush for the nation's highest court. He served on the Supreme Court for nearly 20 years, often frustrating Republicans during his tenure as he consistently joined with the liberal members of the court.",
      "Souter stepped down from the Supreme Court in 2009, creating the first vacancy for then-President Barack Obama to fill. He was succeeded by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who made history as the first Hispanic member of the high court and whose appointment did not change the ideological makeup of the high court.",
      "In a statement reacting to Souter's death that was distributed by the court, Sotomayor said he would send her notes after his retirement, which she will \"forever treasure for their insightfulness and beautiful turns of phrase.\"",
      "\"David Souter was a unique man with a special kindness and grace,\" she said. \"He joined the court purely out of a sense of duty to the country. He loved his home in New Hampshire dearly and he left it only to serve his nation.\"",
      "Sotomayor called Souter a \"man of honor who served the Court with great distinction.\"",
      "Born in Melrose, Massachusetts, on Sept. 17, 1939, Souter was an only child. He graduated from Harvard University in 1961 and spent two years as a Rhodes scholar at Magdalen College at Oxford. Souter received his law degree from Harvard in 1966 and began his legal career at the private firm Orr & Reno in Concord, New Hampshire.",
      "Souter left private practice to become assistant attorney general of New Hampshire in 1968, followed by deputy attorney general in 1971 and attorney general of New Hampshire in 1976. He then served as an associate justice on the New Hampshire Superior Court and was appointed in 1983 to the state Supreme Court by then-Gov. John Sununu.",
      "Souter's career on the federal bench began in May 1990, when Bush tapped him for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit. He was a judge on the 1st Circuit for only three months before Bush nominated Souter for the U.S. Supreme Court. The Senate confirmed Souter as the 105th justice by a 90-9 vote, and he joined the high court on Oct. 8, 1990.",
      "Souter had been described as a \"stealth\" candidate, given that he had not authored many controversial opinions and did not have a lengthy paper trail. Sununu, who was Bush's chief of staff and recommended Souter for the Supreme Court, said he\u00a0would be a \"home run\"\u00a0for conservatives.",
      "But Sununu's prediction that Souter would be a conservative justice proved incorrect. Souter joined\u00a0Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer in allowing the narrowly tailored use of race in admissions decisions.",
      "He also co-authored the 1992 majority opinion with O'Connor and Justice Anthony Kennedy that reaffirmed Roe v. Wade's central holding that the Constitution recognizes the right to abortion, but set out a new standard for determining when government restrictions are allowed.",
      "Less than 15 years after Souter's retirement, a more conservative Supreme Court would go on to\u00a0overturn the landmark Roe decision\u00a0and effectively\u00a0end the use of affirmative action\u00a0in college admissions.",
      "Souter  also was among the four justices who\u00a0dissented\u00a0from the 2000 decision in Bush v. Gore and said the Supreme Court should not have stopped Florida's recount in the presidential contest.",
      "\"There is no justification for denying the state the opportunity to try to count all disputed ballots now,\" Souter wrote in a dissenting opinion.",
      "Souter returned to New Hampshire after retiring from the Supreme Court but continued to hear and decide cases on the 1st Circuit. Notably, he\u00a0joined a 2019 decision\u00a0from the Boston-based appellate court upholding Massachusetts' ban on certain semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity magazines.",
      "In 2020, Souter was part of a\u00a0unanimous decision\u00a0finding that the Justice Department during President Trump's first term lacked authority to condition federal law enforcement grants on state and local governments' assistance with deporting migrants suspected of entering the country unlawfully.",
      "Some of the Supreme Court's sitting justices remembered Souter in statements and praised his kindness and modesty.",
      "\"David was a wonderful colleague and friend,\" Justice Clarence Thomas said. \"It was truly a great honor to serve on the court with him and to get to know him as the kind, honorable, and decent man he was.\"",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch said he was a Supreme Court clerk while Souter was a member of the court and recalled how the retired justice made him feel welcome when he returned to the court.",
      "\"When I joined the court many years later, he was retired but he took time to offer me and my family a warm welcome back, kindly fielding one question after another from a rookie,\" Gorsuch said. \"He will be remembered not just for his many contributions to this court's jurisprudence over almost 19 years of service, but for his kindness, his incredible Yankee work ethic, and his love of our Constitution and country.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court on Friday said Columbia student Mohsen Mahdawi can remain released from immigration custody while a legal challenge to his detention moves forward, denying a request from the Trump administration to allow immigration officials to re-detain Mahdawi.",
      "The three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit unanimously rejected the government's bid for emergency relief, finding that it is unlikely to succeed on its arguments that a Vermont district court did not have jurisdiction over Mahdawi's habeas petition. The 2nd Circuit panel also said that the Justice Department was unlikely to succeed on its claims that the lower court lacked the authority to order Mahdawi's release last week.",
      "\"[T]he practical effect of the relief the government seeks would be Mahdawi's re-detention. Individual liberty substantially outweighs the government's weak assertions of administrative and logistical costs,\" Judges Barrington Parker, Alison Nathan and Susan Carney wrote in their decision.",
      "Mahdawi, who is to graduate from Columbia this month with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, was detained by immigration agents in Vermont last month during what he was told was his citizenship interview. His attorneys say he was detained under a rarely used law allowing the government to revoke a visa if the Secretary of State determines somebody poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "Mahdawi's legal team has argued he was detained for his role in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia, in violation of the First Amendment. The Trump administration argues it has the right to revoke visas, and has accused Mahdawi of antisemitic statements and threatening rhetoric \u2014 which Mahdawi has denied.",
      "He was born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and he has held a green card for the last 10 years. He co-founded his university's Palestinian Student Union alongside Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Columbia Ph.D. student and U.S. resident also detained by the government. Mahdawi's attorneys said he took a \"step back\" from the high-profile protests at the school before students began occupying university buildings.",
      "Khalil, a Palestinian born in Syria, was also linked to last year's protests at Columbia. He was detained by ICE in March, with the government citing the same \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" argument. He is also challenging his removal and detention, though an immigration judge allowed the government to proceed with its effort to deport Khalil.",
      "In an interview with CBS News the day before his detention, Mahdawi said he feared the citizenship interview was a \"honey trap\" that allowed federal immigration officials to detain him while he went in to pursue U.S. citizenship.",
      "Mahdawi's attorneys secured a court order that blocked the Trump administration from deporting him or moving him outside of Vermont. Then, last week, Crawford released Mahdawi from federal detention as his immigration proceedings continue and again barred the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "Mahdawi spoke with CBS News earlier this week, calling his detention \"a betrayal to the Constitution of this country\" and the Trump administration's rationale for detaining him \"laughable.\" He also said he plans to continue protesting.",
      "\"I wasn't afraid when they detained me. I was not afraid when I got out of detention. And I'm not afraid to share my voice,\" he told CBS News national correspondent Lilia Luciano in his first network interview since his release from custody in Vermont.",
      "Since his release, Mahdawi has also been critical of his school, Columbia University, which agreed last month to make several policy changes sought by the Trump administration. The school said a group of pro-Palestinian protesters \"occupied\" a library reading room Wednesday evening, leading New York City police to take dozens into custody.",
      "In an interview with the Associated Press, Mahdawi accused the school of inciting violence.",
      "\"Columbia University is participating in the destruction of the democratic system,\" Mahdawi said in the interview. \"They are supporting the initiatives and the agenda of the Trump administration, and they are punishing and torturing their students",

      "Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday that in the coming days, he'd reveal \"a truly earth-shattering and positive development for this country and for the people of this country.\"",
      "\"The President will make a big and historic announcement on Monday. Until then, everyone can keep guessing!,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.",
      "Court orders sought by the drug industry and others blocked the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, from implementing the proposal in Mr. Trump's first term, saying that the government failed to go through the proper rulemaking steps to create and implement the policy, which was finalized in late 2020.",
      "\"While there's nothing unlawful per se about rushing to enact policy in the final days of a presidential administration (indeed, it's a time-honored tradition), executive branch officials may not circumvent clear legal requirements in the eleventh hour to achieve goals they couldn't accomplish in the normal course,\" a federal judge in California ruled in 2020.",
      "The Biden administration abandoned the proposal in 2022, blaming court orders blocking the model and concerns raised by stakeholders, including fears that it could cut off some Medicare beneficiaries from drugs and strain providers.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the agency does not comment on potential demonstration projects being considered by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, the arm of CMS that proposed the idea during Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "\"This Administration remains committed to lowering prescription drug prices for Americans in line with the President's Executive Order,\" the spokesperson said in a statement, likely referring to an April order directing HHS to look for ways to cut drug prices.",
      "Mr. Trump's Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at the possibility of the policy returning on Tuesday, pointing to higher prices in Europe for the blockbuster diabetes drug Ozempic. The drug is also used for weight loss under a different brand name, Wegovy.",
      "\"Right now the big impediment is really price. And we're negotiating that with the drug companies and seeing if we can at least launch some pilot programs, or if we can get the price low enough, we can make it available at government cost to everybody,\" he said in an interview with Newsmax.",
      "Kennedy defended a decision by the Trump administration last month not to cover weight loss drugs in Medicare and Medicaid, scrapping a proposal touted by the Biden administration. The Trump administration is continuing to negotiate the cost of Ozempic in Medicare under talks launched by the Biden administration, but only for its uses to treat diabetes and other health conditions.",
      "While drugs like Ozempic are \"miracle drugs in many ways,\" Kennedy warned that their cost was prohibitively expensive.",
      "\"If we made that so that Medicaid, Medicare paid for it, and that private insurance companies had to pay for it, we would double the cost of health insurance to most employers in this country. And that would really be destructive,\" he said.",

      "David Steiner, a former CEO of the nation's largest waste management company who currently serves on the FedEx board of directors, is poised to take over control of the U.S. Postal Service, becoming the nation's 76th postmaster general.",
      "The announcement of Steiner's appointment, which drew immediate concerns from postal unions over possible efforts to privatize the USPS, was made Friday by Amber McReynolds, chairperson of the USPS' Board of Governors, during a meeting of the independent group that oversees the service.",
      "\"We anticipate that Mr. Steiner will join the organization in July, assuming his successful completion of the ethics and security clearance processes that are currently underway,\" McReynolds said.",
      "Friday's announcement by the the Board of Governors comes as President Trump and his adviser Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have raised the idea of privatizing the nearly 250-year-old Postal Service, which has faced financial challenges amid a changing mail mix and other issues.",
      "The choice of Steiner has been seen by the postal unions as a harbinger for possible privatization of some or all of the venerable quasi-public institution, which is largely self-funded and has a mission to serve every address in the country \u2014 nearly 167 million residences, businesses and post office boxes.",
      "Postal unions have held protests throughout the country over potential privatization, job cuts and possibly ending the universal service obligation.",
      "Brian L. Renfroe, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers, said Steiner is not just any executive from the private sector but someone who sits on the board of one of the Postal Service's top competitors.",
      "\"His selection isn't just a conflict of interest \u2014 it's an aggressive step toward handing America's mail system over to corporate interests,\" Renfroe said in a statement. \"Private shippers have been waiting to get USPS out of parcel delivery for years. Steiner's selection is an open invitation to do just that.\"",
      "Renfroe's union represents 205,000 active city letter carriers and around 90,000 retirees.",
      "Mark Dimondstein, president of the American Postal Workers Union, which represents more than 220,000 USPS employees and retirees, likened the appointment of Steiner to a fox guarding a hen house.",
      "\"FedEx has a very different agenda than the public postal service. And they're a major competitor of the United States Postal Service,\" he said. \"I'm not talking about any attributes of an individual, but to me, that's the last type of person you will put in charge of the public institution as the anchor of the mailing package industry in the country.\"",
      "Steiner, who will leave the FedEx board, said in a written statement that he admires the public service mission of the USPS and called it \"an incredible honor to be asked to lead the world's greatest postal organization.\"",
      "\"I believe strongly in maintaining its role as an independent establishment of the executive branch,\" said Steiner, who served as CEO of Waste Management Inc. from 2004 through October 2016.",
      "In a written statement, McReynolds called Steiner \"the right person to lead the Postal Service at this time to ensure this magnificent and historic organization thrives into the future.\"",
      "\"Dave is a highly regarded leader and executive with tremendous vision, experience and skill that can be applied to the long-term mission and business needs of the Postal Service,\" she added. \"Our Board looks forward to working with Dave as he takes on the core mandates of providing universal and excellent service for the American public and doing so in a financially sustainable manner.\"",
      "The Postal Service is in the midst of a 10-year modernization and cost-cutting plan that began in 2021 under Postmaster Louis DeJoy, who resigned in March. The plan is an attempt to stop losses at the agency, which has a budget of about $78 billion a year and is mostly self-funded, including through stamps and packages.",
      "Known as \"Deliver for America,\" the initiative has received markedly mixed reviews. While postal officials contend it has led to major efficiency improvements, some members of Congress have criticized it for leading to mail delays, unsustainable postage increases and declines in business.",

      "Trump administration funding cuts and a loss of federal workers who help support wildland firefighting continues to make planning for the upcoming wildfire season a challenge, according to forest and fire officials in Washington state and Oregon.",
      "The biggest issue they're facing is a lack of communication from the federal government as the West faces \"a pretty significant wildland fire season,\" Washington State Forester George Geissler said Thursday during a press conference hosted by Democratic Sens. Patty Murray of Washington and Jeff Merkley of Oregon.",
      "\"This is the time when we make certain that we have the aviation we need, when we have the personnel we need and that all of our systems check out and are ready to go when the alarm bell rings,\" he said. \"Without knowing what our partners are doing or not having a clear understanding of what actions are being taken, we struggle with missing the third leg of the stool that we have.\"",
      "The Forest Service workforce was cut in February during Elon Musk's push to reduce federal spending\u00a0as part of the Department of Government Efficiency, known as\u00a0DOGE. At least 1,000 National Park Service workers were let go. A court order to rehire fired workers, along with a public outcry brought many workers back to their jobs, but Murray and fire officials say it wasn't enough. Plus, the lost of experienced, trained workers set the process back.",
      "\"We're hearing that don't worry, we are going to hire frontline people,\" Murray said. \"You just let a whole bunch of frontline people go.\"",
      "\"Funding is not in jeopardy\"",
      "A spokesperson with the Department of Interior, which oversees National Parks and other public lands, said \"funding is not in jeopardy.\" They're supporting firefighting efforts by increasing pay for federal and tribal wildland firefighters across the U.S.",
      "The administration has refused to release the exact number of fired and rehired workers, but numbers are coming in from individual forests, she said.",
      "\"I've heard of at least 35 people at Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, 46 at Okanagan-Wenatchee, 21 at Colville, 15 at Gifford-Pinchot, and more at the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Olympic National Forest and Methow Valley,\" she said. \"Here's the thing, nearly every single Forest Service employee supports fire operations in some capacity.\"",
      "Fire Chief Leonard Johnson, with the McLane Black Fire Department in Washington state, said they may line up aviation support and heavy equipment, but it takes trained firefighters to put the fires out.",
      "\"We have a high reliance on that workforce out there,\" he said. \"Not only at the local level, at the state level, but at the federal level to make our wildfire season successful to deal with those large fires. People are the critical component in all of this.\"",
      "National Forest workers reduced by thousands",
      "Merkley said Trump's budget proposal cuts forest and watershed management programs that improve forest conditions, eliminates a collaborative forest landscape restoration program and slashes 2,000 National Forest positions, on top of the thousands who left through early retirement, buyouts and layoffs.",
      "Most of those workers may not have the title \"firefighter\" but they all hold Red Cards - which shows they have special training to provide essential frontline support to firefighting crews, Murray said.",
      "\"In fact, around three quarters of forest service workers are trained in wild land firefighting,\" she said. \"They provide crucial surge capacity when a crisis strikes.\"",
      "Trail maintenance crews ensure the paths are clear for firefighting personnel and equipment, Murray said. Biologists conduct testing to make decisions about prescribed burns and fuel reduction planning.",
      "\"We are here today to pull the fire alarm, and we're gonna set off some sirens,\" she said. \"We're going to keep focused on this, and we are gonna keep pushing back. There is just too much at stake to do anything less.\"",

    "summary": "The group of House and Senate Democrats say Trump's designation of Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations unlocks legal tools that will help address the flow of U.S.-made guns across the border with Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of House and Senate Democrats is urging top Trump administration officials to use the recent designation of Latin American cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations to take action to curtail the flow of American-made guns across the southern border.",
      "The 14 Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Attorney General Pam Bondi that the designation unlocks additional legal tools that would allow the administration to disrupt the cartels' financial networks and impose harsher penalties on entities that provide material support to them.",
      "Federal law makes it a crime, subject to fines and up to 20 years in prison, to knowingly provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization. Entities that provide weapons, money, equipment or other support to those groups can face federal prosecution if found liable.",
      "\"If you want to really tackle the fentanyl trade, you have to tackle the source of the power of the people who are involved in that trade, and there's no way to do that without addressing the guns that they receive from American-made manufacturers and dealers,\" Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who led the letter, told CBS News. \"It's a choice I would say, which is you can't actually successfully dismantle the cartels without also dismantling the gun trafficking that goes southward that allows them to send the fentanyl trafficking northward.\"",
      "The Democrats urged the Departments of Homeland Security, State and Justice to take \"immediate\" steps to stem the flow of firearms manufactured in the U.S. into Mexico by boosting interagency cooperation to dismantle smuggling rings that facilitate gun trafficking; expanding inspections at border crossings; increasing law enforcement efforts against straw purchased and gun dealers that provide material support to smugglers; and bolstering intelligence-sharing between the U.S. and Mexican authorities and other partners to target weapons traffickers.",
      "\"This steady supply of weapons coming in from the north has allowed these criminal organizations to gain control over fentanyl and human trafficking across the border and undermine Mexican law enforcement,\" they wrote in the letter. \"Put simply, if we do not stop the flow of American-made guns across the southern border to Mexico, we cannot stop the flow of fentanyl into our country over that same border.\"",
      "Goldman said the Justice Department should initiate investigations into gun makers and dealers to determine whether they're knowingly distributing and selling guns to drug cartels, either directly or through straw purchasers.",
      "\"The fact that there is an intermediary does not mean that there isn't a criminal conspiracy that they are a part of, and that the DOJ needs to use this new foreign terrorist organization-designation to apply more pressure on the gun industry to stop the flow of American guns to the cartels,\" he said.",
      "Between 200,000 to 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's been called the \"iron river.\"\u00a0Nearly half of all firearms recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Mexico, meanwhile, has just one gun store in the country and stringent firearms laws.",
      "An investigation from CBS Reports exposed how Americans are helping Mexican drug cartels smuggle weapons across the U.S.-Mexico border. Guns are purchased by straw purchasers in the U.S., and a network of brokers and couriers then transport them across the border and into Mexico. U.S. intelligence documents and interviews with current and former federal officials revealed that the federal government has known about the weapons trafficked by cartels for years, but has done little to stop the networks that operate in the U.S..",
      "In an effort to combat the violence wrought by drug cartels, the Mexican government filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in 2021 against seven of the biggest U.S. firearms manufacturers and one wholesaler. Mexico is seeking $10 billion in damages from the gun industry, as well as other forms of relief.",
      "Firearms manufacturers, though, are seeking to block the suit because of a federal law that shields them from liability for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether Mexico's suit can proceed, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sought to use the suit as leverage in trade negotiations with President Trump after his administration designated drug cartels as terrorist groups and threatened earlier this year to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican imports.",
      "Mr. Trump agreed in February to a 30-day pause on the tariffs on Mexican imports after speaking with Sheinbaum. Mexico's president said at the time that the U.S. government is \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "Goldman, who served as lead counsel in the first impeachment investigation of Mr. Trump before he was elected to Congress, said dismantling drug cartels to stop the trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs into the U.S. is a shared goal with the administration and should bring collaboration.",
      "\"One component of doing that has got to be stopping the Iron River streamline of American guns going into the cartel's hands,\" he said.",
      "Goldman introduced legislation in the last Congress that aimed to strengthen border security by curbing the trafficking of U.S.-made guns and ammunition across the southern border and said he is working to re-introduce the bill in the current Congress.",
      "Joining Goldman on the letter are: Senators Ben Ray Lujan and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Representatives Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Eric Swalwell of California, Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island, Lou Correa of California, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Jill Tokuda of Hawaii, Nellie Pou of New Jersey, Timothy Kennedy of New York and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appellate panel on Tuesday considered high-profile cases involving two international students who were detained by federal immigration officials and now face removal from the U.S. after they made statements that were critical of Israel.",
      "The panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit heard arguments in emergency appeals from the Trump administration after two federal judges issued separate decisions in favor of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, and Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University, last month.",
      "Administration officials are asking the 2nd Circuit to pause the lower court orders issued in Ozturk and Mahdawi's cases while their challenges to their respective detentions move forward. In Ozturk's case, U.S. District Judge William Sessions issued an order for Ozturk, who is being detained at a facility in Louisiana, to be transferred to Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in Vermont and set a bail hearing for her to attend in person on May 9.",
      "U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ordered Mahdawi's release from immigration custody while the challenge to his detention proceeds.",
      "Appeals court Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan weighed the administration's request for a stay of the two orders, and said following arguments that they will take the matters under advisement.",
      "The cases are still in their early stages, and the lower court judges, Sessions and Crawford, are still weighing Ozturk and Mahdawi's respective habeas corpus challenges to their confinement. But a key issue in the two cases is untangling the removal proceedings playing out in immigration court from the challenges to their detentions that were filed in federal court, and what is required in each of those cases.",
      "Ozturk, a Ph.D. student at Tufts, was arrested by federal immigration officials near her Somerville, Massachusetts, apartment on March 25, after the Trump administration revoked her student visa. She was not notified of the revocation before her arrest, according to court records.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in March that at least 300 students studying at American universities have had their visas rescinded after they were accused of expressing support for Palestinians or participating in campus protests.",
      "Ozturk co-authored an opinion piece in the Tufts' student newspaper that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed did not mention Hamas.",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, Esha Bhandari, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney representing Ozturk, said her client has been \"held behind bars for six weeks while her health deteriorates for writing an op-ed.\" All she is asking for is for the temporary transfer order to be completed as court proceedings play out in Vermont, Bhandari said.",
      "\"The executive branch made a specific decision to detain Ms. Ozturk because of her speech,\" she said.",
      "The Justice Department has argued in part that the district court in Vermont does not have jurisdiction over Ozturk's habeas petition because it was not filed where she is confined \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 and did not name her immediate custodian as a defendant \u2014 the warden at the detention center.",
      "But Bhandari argued that the executive branch effectively suspended the writ of habeas corpus on its own by refusing to specify to Ozturk's lawyers who had custody of her, which would have allowed them to name that person as the defendant in Ozturk's challenge to her detention.",
      "Bhandari called the government's position \"breathtaking.\"",
      "According to court filings, a memorandum from a senior official with the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs said Ozturk's visa was revoked based on a request from ICE and the Department of Homeland Security, which determined that she \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization.'\"",
      "After she was arrested, Ozturk was transported to Methuen, Massachusetts, and transported to Lebanon, New Hampshire, followed by St. Albans, Vermont, where she was kept overnight. On the morning of March 26, in Burlington, Vermont, Ozturk was put on a plane and flown to Louisiana, where she is currently in custody at an immigration facility in Basile.",
      "Ozturk's lawyers filed a petition challenging her arrest and detention as a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments in federal district court in Massachusetts. But the case was transferred to Sessions' court in Vermont after it was determined that Ozturk was detained in that state at the time the petition was filed.",
      "The Justice Department sought to dismiss Ozturk's petition while her lawyers asked Sessions to order her to be released or transferred to Vermont while her claims are adjudicated.",
      "Sessions last month ruled that Ozturk's arrest and detention raised \"significant constitutional concerns\" and said she must be transferred to ICE custody in Vermont by May 1. He also set a bail hearing for May 9, with Ozturk appearing in person, and will consider the merits of her habeas petition on May 22.",
      "The 2nd Circuit temporarily paused Sessions' order late last month while it considers the Trump administration's request for emergency relief.",
      "Mahdawi, who is to graduate from Columbia this month with a bachelor's degree in philosophy, was detained by immigration agents in Vermont last month during what he was told was his citizenship interview.",
      "He was born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and he has held a green card for the last 10 years and co-founded his university's Palestinian Student Union, alongside Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist, Columbia Ph.D. student and U.S. resident detained by the government. Mahdawi's attorneys said he took a \"step back\" from the high-profile protests at the school before students began occupying university buildings.",
      "Khalil, a Palestinian born in Syria, was a vocal member of last year's protests at Columbia. He was arrested by ICE in March. He is also challenging his removal and detention, though an immigration judge allowed the government to proceed with its effort to deport Khalil.",
      "In an interview with CBS News the day before his arrest, Mahdawi called the interview a \"honey trap\" that allowed federal immigration officials to detain him while he went in to pursue U.S. citizenship.",
      "Mahdawi's attorneys secured a court order that blocked the Trump administration from deporting him or moving him outside of Vermont. Then, last week, Crawford released Mahdawi from federal detention as his immigration proceedings continue and again barred the government from removing him from the state or country.",
      "A U.S. attorney arguing against Mahdawi's release said that keeping him in detention would be a \"constitutionally valid aspect of the deportation process\" and argued in court filings that Mahdawi's \"presence and activities\" in the U.S. \"have serious adverse foreign policy consequences\" if he remains here.",
      "But Naz Ahmad, who argued on Mahdawi's behalf before the 2nd Circuit, told the judges that the government's detention of her client was \"retaliatory\" and had not only chilled his speech, but also others. He is challenging his detention as a violation of the First and First Amendments.",
      "If the 2nd Circuit grants the Justice Department's request for the stay in Mahdawi's case, it would allow immigration authorities to re-detain him. But two of the judges on the panel seemed to question how the government is harmed by the lower court's decision ordering Mahdawi's release.",
      "Barrington asked Drew Ensign, a Justice Department lawyer, whether an \"adverse\" decision constitutes irreparable harm to the government. Irreparable harm is one of four factors courts analyze when considering whether to grant a stay of a lower court order.",
      "Ensign mentioned operational costs to the government that would arise from Mahdawi having to participate in immigration proceedings, which are being held separately in Louisiana, from Vermont.",
      "One of the judges noted that in both Mahdawi and Ozturk's cases, the district court judges have indicated a \"strong desire\" to move quickly when considering the challenges to their allegedly unlawful detentions.",
      "The Trump administration has been cracking down on U.S. universities and their students who were involved in pro-Palestinian protests waged after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel, which triggered the war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "President Trump signed an executive order in January that ordered his administration to use \"all available and appropriate legal tools, to prosecute, remove, or otherwise hold to account the perpetrators of unlawful anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" The White House said that these efforts would include deporting alleged \"Hamas sympathizers\" and revoking student visas.",

      "Ozturk's lawyers filed a petition challenging her arrest and detention as a violation of the First and Fifth Amendments in federal district court in Massachusetts. But the case was transferred to the U.S. district court in Vermont after it was determined that Ozturk was detained in that state at the time the petition was filed.",
      "The Justice Department sought to dismiss Ozturk's petition, claiming the district court in Vermont lacks jurisdiction since Ozturk is confined in Louisiana. But Ozturk's lawyers asked U.S. District Judge William Sessions to order her to be released or transferred to Vermont while her claims are adjudicated. Sessions last month ruled that Ozturk had to be transferred to ICE custody in Vermont by May 1. He also set a bail hearing for May 9, with Ozturk appearing in person, and will consider the merits of her habeas petition on May 22.",
      "The 2nd Circuit then temporarily halted Sessions' order while it considered the Trump administration's emergency appeal.",
      "The judges said that Ozturk's constitutional challenge to her detention can move forward, even amid a potential challenge to deportation from the U.S., which would arise after an order of removal has been entered by an immigration judge and affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.",
      "\"She asserts that the government arrested and detained her to prevent speech with which it disagrees. Such an act would be a violation of the Constitution \u2014 quite separate from the removal procedures followed by the immigration courts,\" they wrote.",
      "The panel noted that Ozturk is not seeking to disrupt removal proceedings and said she can attend any hearings before an immigration judge remotely from Vermont.",
      "The judges also highlighted the timeline of the government's actions moving Ozturk from Massachusetts, where she was arrested, to Louisiana. A federal district judge in Massachusetts had blocked the government from moving Ozturk outside of the state without first providing advance notice, and issued that directive without an hour of the petition challenging her detention being filed.",
      "\"Although not technically non-compliant, despite this order, the government moved Ozturk from Vermont to Louisiana the next morning,\" the 2nd Circuit panel said.",
      "The appeals court considered Ozturk's case alongside that of another international student,\u00a0Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian student at Columbia University. Mahdawi, a green card holder who was born in the West Bank, was detained by immigration agents in Vermont last month during what he was told was a citizenship interview.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford\u00a0ordered Mahdawi's release from immigration custody while a challenge to his detention proceeds. The Trump administration appealed that decision and asked the 2nd Circuit to pause the ruling, which would allow immigration authorities to re-detain him.",
      "The panel has not yet ruled on the Justice Department's request for emergency relief in Mahdawi's case.",

    "story": [
      "Wellington, New Zealand \u2014 The strange reproductive habits of a large, carnivorous New Zealand snail were once shrouded in mystery. Now, footage of the snail laying an egg from its neck has been captured for the first time, the country's conservation agency said Wednesday.",
      "What looks like a tiny hen's egg is seen emerging from an opening below the head of the Powelliphanta augusta snail, a threatened species endemic to New Zealand.",
      "The video was taken at a facility on the South Island's West Coast, where conservation rangers attempting to save the species from extinction have cared for a population of the snails in chilled containers for nearly two decades.",
      "The conditions in the containers mimic the alpine weather in their only former habitat - a remote mountain they were named for, on the West Coast of the South Island, that has been engulfed by mining.",
      "Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the creatures for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises.",
      "\"It's remarkable that in all the time we've spent caring for the snails, this is the first time we've seen one lay an egg,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Like other snails, Powelliphanta augusta are hermaphrodites, which explains how the creatures can reproduce when encased in a hard shell. The invertebrate uses a genital pore on the right side of its body, just below the head, to simultaneously exchange sperm with another snail, which is stored until each creates an egg.",
      "Each snail takes eight years to reach sexual maturity, after which it lays about five eggs a year. The egg can take more than a year to hatch.",
      "\"Some of our captive snails are between 25 and 30 years old,\" said Flanagan. \"They're polar opposites to the pest garden snail we introduced to New Zealand, which is like a weed, with thousands of offspring each year and a short life.\"",
      "The dozens of species and subspecies of Powelliphanta snails are only found in New Zealand, mostly in rugged forest and grassland settings where they're threatened by habitat loss.",
      "They're carnivores that slurp up earthworms like noodles and are some of the world's largest snails with oversized, distinctive shells in a range of rich earth colors and swirling patterns.",
      "The Powelliphanta augusta was the center of public uproar and legal proceedings in the early 2000s, when an energy company's plans to mine for coal threatened to destroy the snails' habitat.",
      "Some 4,000 were removed from the site and relocated, while 2,000 more were housed in chilled storage in the West Coast town of Hokitika to ensure the preservation of the species, which is slow to breed and doesn't adapt well to new habitats.",
      "In 2011, some 800 of the snails accidentally died in a Department of Conservation refrigerator with faulty temperature control.",
      "But the species' slow survival continues: In March this year, there were nearly 1,900 snails and nearly 2,200 eggs in captivity, the conservation agency said.",

    "story": [
      "Just weeks ago, scientists warned that a \"city killer\" asteroid had a small chance of hitting Earth. While that prediction was thankfully\u00a0revised, the planet may have to worry about another object plummeting down from the heavens \u2014 a 1970s spacecraft called Kosmos 482.",
      "The Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth within hours. The Aerospace Corporation's reentry prediction map\u00a0currently forecasts the object to fall through the atmosphere at 05:54 UTC on Saturday, or 1:54 am ET, but that forecast has fluctuated.",
      "It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek, a lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact.",
      "\"While not without risk, we should not be too worried,\" Langbroek said in an email.",
      "Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, Langbroek wrote in a\u00a0blog post. That represents a vast area, including the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle. Still, most of the Earth is covered by water so the risk to humans remains low.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",
      "Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, told NPR that the spacecraft is making its \"final death plunge.\"",
      "\"I expect it'll have the usual one-in-several-thousand chance of hitting someone,\" McDowell wrote last month. \"No need for major concern, but you wouldn't want it bashing you on the head.\"",
      "Kosmos 482 launched in 1972",
      "The Soviet Union launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth's orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",
      "The spacecraft could reenter anywhere between 51.7 degrees north and south latitude, or as far north as London and Edmonton in Alberta, Canada, almost all the way down to South America's Cape Horn. But since most of the planet is water, \"chances are good it will indeed end up in some ocean,\" Langbroek said.",
      "Space debris could impact planes",
      "Space junk crashing back back to Earth could be a growing problem for aircraft, researchers warned in a\u00a0recent study.",
      "The study's authors said that the probability of space debris hitting an airplane is small, but the risk is rising due to increases in both space debris reentries and flights.",
      "The study found that high-density regions close to major airports have an 0.8% chance per year of being affected by an uncontrolled rocket reentry, but in \"larger but still busy\" airspace areas like those found in the northeastern U.S. or around major cities in Asia, the risk rose to 26%.",
      "\"While the probability of a strike is low, the consequences could be catastrophic,\" the researchers said in the study, which was\u00a0published in Scientific Reports.",
      "Space junk has hit Earth recently",
      "Space debris has crashed back into Earth in recent months.",
      "In February, debris from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that blasted off in the United States entered the Earth's atmosphere over Poland. Two chunks from an unidentified object \u2014 both measuring about 5 feet by 3 feet \u2014 were later found on the ground. Police said it was possible the objects came from the SpaceX rocket.",
      "Last New Year's Eve, fragments of metal, believed to be from a rocket, crashed into a village in Kenya.",
      "In March 2024, NASA faced a lawsuit\u00a0from a family whose Florida home was hit by a piece of falling metal.",

But light from the waxing moon will wash out the fainter meteors this year, according to Bill Cooke, who leads NASA's Meteoroid Environments Office.

      "Billionaire businessman and philanthropist Bill Gates is giving up his wealth for the health and wellness of millions, announcing exclusively on \"CBS Mornings\" on Thursday that he's committing $200 billion from the Gates Foundation to be spent over the next 20 years.",
      "Gates first revealed his plan to give away virtually all of his wealth in an interview with \"CBS Mornings\" last week, saying he will take an \"equity, value-driven approach\" to the distribution of funds. It will go toward several causes, with a focus on global health and education. His ultimate goal: save tens of millions of lives, especially those of women and children suffering from HIV, malaria and other deadly illnesses.",
      "Here are some highlights from his discussion about his $200 billion mission, as well as what he calls his \"last chapter\" in life \u2014 and more.",
      "\"It's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do\"",
      "Gates said he won't miss the money, but he does hope he'll live long enough to see some of the positive ways it has helped hard-hit communities.",
      "\"I hope I'm still alive when we finish the 20 years, but I will save a little bit to be able to buy hamburgers \u2014 as much as I need,\" Gates joked.",
      "Some might be thinking, Why now? To Gates, it's simple: You can get more done by spending more money. That's why the Microsoft co-founder said he's \"doubling down.\"",
      "\"And after that, there will be other very wealthy people who can understand what the problems are, what's still left over,\" Gates said.",
      "\"And, in a way, it's wild that somebody can have as much money as I do,\" he added.",
      "More children will die due to aid cuts by Trump administration, Gates says",
      "As the U.S. and other European countries cut foreign aid budgets, health experts have voiced concerns about the implications for global health. In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March, marking a significant drop since 1990. Gates expects deaths could rise again, and it's something he wants to address.",
      "\"I will say, despite the challenges we have right now, which are huge and surprising, I'm very optimistic about the progress we can make over the next 20 years,\" Gates said. \"The next five, there will be setbacks because of these cutbacks, but we will get \u2013 and so the number 5 million might go up for a bit, which shouldn't happen. It's terrible. But, over time, we will get that number down even below 3 million.\"",
      "Gates urges U.S. leaders to consider the difference that maintaining foreign aid \u2014 roughly 1% of last year's federal budget\u00a0\u2014 can make.",
      "\"For 1%, if you can save lives for 1,000 times less than we save lives here, and if that creates stability in those countries, so they're thriving countries that will participate in the global economy,\" Gates explained. \"And we don't have to intervene with our military or anything, and the strategic relationship with them, where they see that we have helped them advance, and that that money is why you will be able to see a future pandemic early and stop it from spreading like COVID did all the way to the United States.\"",
      "Gates hopes the U.S. will follow his lead in helping some of the world's poorest nations, and said he will always advocate for governments to help.",
      "\"We never ask for more than 1% to go to helping the poorest. And I think cutting \u2014 when you're well below that 1%, cutting that I think \u2013 doesn't reflect the values I think we should stand for,\" said Gates, adding that the U.S. shouldn't cut money for vaccines or HIV medicines.",
      "Some of these topics came up during a three-hour dinner\u00a0between Gates and President Trump at Mar-a-Lago in December. Gates said they had a \"great discussion\" about polio and\u00a0 innovations in HIV prevention and working together to get an \"HIV cure sooner.\"",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said.",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "\"I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities,\" said Gates, adding that the Gates Foundation can't replace U.S. assistance.",
      "In fiscal 2024, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, with $14.4 billion toward humanitarian assistance, the Pew Research Center reports, citing ForeignAssistance.gov.",
      "Gates fears foreign aid cuts could lead to even more childhood deaths due to a lack of vaccines and HIV medicines that prevent mothers from infecting their babies.",
      "\"Instead of [deaths] going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "The \"last chapter\" of Gates' career",
      "Gates is marking many significant milestones this year \u2014 the Gates Foundation turning 25 years old, Microsoft turning 50 and Gates himself turning 70.",
      "\"I'm stunned that I'm 70, because, when I was young, and I thought, hey, those old people don't\u2026 they're not very up to date on what's changing, what's important. And so here I am,\" said Gates, admitting that his \"Microsoft days were very intense.\"",
      "These days, he's spending his spare time playing pickleball and tennis, and reading. He also travels regularly to Africa and India as part of his work with the Gates Foundation, overseeing some of the programs he's partnered with to improve health and development.",
      "\"I get to travel and see the impact. And I'm not working. In my 20s, all I did was work,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he doesn't \"feel like a 70-year-old,\" but he wishes he had \"even more time.\"",
      "Toward the end of a letter he posted online Thursday explaining his decision to give away virtually all his wealth, Gates said he's beginning the \"last chapter\" of his career.",
      "\"And I hope I'm lucky enough that during the 20 years that we spend all of these resources that I will be able to both help guide it somewhat and see the work and make sure that others are going to step in to pick up whatever doesn't get done during these next 20 years,\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Part of Gates' motivation stems from the generosity of his good friend Warren Buffett, who has donated billions to the Gates Foundation over the past 19 years. Buffett, who is now 94 and announced this month he'll be\u00a0stepping down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, made lifetime pledges two decades ago to five charities \u2014 including the Gates Foundation \u2014 that will continue until his death. At the time, it was the\u00a0largest philanthropic pledge in history.",
      "\"I should make sure that it's well spent. Warren Buffett's generosity, that's always \u2014 I have felt a huge responsibility to make sure his generosity is highly impactful. And now this is the last stage of all that,\" Gates added.",
      "What Gates hopes the world says about him in 100 years",
      "When asked what he hopes the world says about him 100 years from now, Gates said he has \"no interest\" in creating a lasting name for himself.",
      "\"If I cared about that, maybe I'd make the foundation a foundation that lasts forever. And other people choose to do that,\" Gates said. \"That's fine. I don't think that's the way to have the most impact. Most of the things I work on will no longer be problems.\"",
      "He hopes people a century from now will be puzzled by some of the diseases he's working to eradicate, like tuberculosis, measles and malaria.",
      "\"I think we will treat all children's lives as having value, because the world will be rich enough and the innovation of tools to let you do that will be so strong, you know, the childhood death number should be very small and not different between different countries,\" Gates said.",
      "AI is a \"very empowering tool\" for future generations",
      "Another tool that Gates believes could help: artificial intelligence.",
      "\"In a certain sense, it's going to be so novel that none of us are ready for it. But some of the aspects of it are incredibly positive,\" said Gates, who said he's seen firsthand how AI-powered teaching assistant Khanmigo, built by the nonprofit Khan Academy, is being used by math teachers in New Jersey.",
      "While AI can help foster curiosity and be a \"very empowering tool,\" Gates said kids will continue to forge their own paths based on their unique interests.",
      "\"Kids will choose what they're interested in. They don't all have to be AI scientists,\" he said.",
      "While some may voice concerns over AI being a motivation killer, Gates argues the opposite. It could give you more freedom and time to spend on things you're passionate about.",
      "\"Well, that's called the 'embarrassment of riches' problem, that you won't have to work the long hours that you work today. You won't have a shortage of doctors and huge waiting lists,\" said Gates, adding that he hopes AI will help support countries, like Africa, that are facing doctor shortages.",
      "\"Society will get to decide: how do you spend time? And how quickly that comes, you would get pretty broad disagreement, but, in general, that's where we're headed. And so \u2014 we will have more freedom. It's a lot better than things going backwards,\" he added.",

      "\"People will say a lot of things about me when I die, but I am determined that 'he died rich' will not be one of them. There are too many urgent problems to solve for me to hold onto resources that could be used to help people,\" Gates wrote.",
      "So, he changed his plans. The Gates Foundation, which was originally supposed to shutter decades after his and ex-wife Melinda French Gates' deaths, will now close in 2045.",
      "The Gates Foundation, which is marking its 25th anniversary this year, has already spent $100 billion to help cut the global childhood mortality rate by investing in medical innovations. Gates said he's seen firsthand how impactful the distribution of vaccines for illnesses like diarrhea and pneumonia can be. That's why he's determined to \"double down.\"",
      "He has three main goals: stopping the deaths of mothers and children from preventable causes, eradicating deadly infectious diseases, and putting more countries on a path to prosperity \u2014 with a focus on improving education.",
      "Gates says more children could die due to Trump administration aid cuts",
      "But he's concerned progress could be stalled as the U.S. and European countries scale back on foreign aid and reduce humanitarian funding.",
      "In 2023, an estimated 4.8 million children died before reaching the age of 5, according to a UNICEF report released in March. Without substantial government assistance, Gates says that number will rise.",
      "\"So we should be going from 5 million children dying a year over the next five years to 4 million. And now with these cuts, if they're not reversed, we will go to over 6 million dying. So, instead of going down, we will go back up,\" Gates said.",
      "Gates said he's been in touch with President Trump and had a \"great discussion\" about some of his foundation's initiatives, including HIV prevention and polio, over dinner at Mar-a-Lago in December.",
      "\"Since then, some of the programs have been cut off,\" Gates said. \"And I'm hoping, both with the president or the Congress, to get them to restore some of those aid activities.\"",
      "On the first day of his second term, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to start the country's withdrawal from the World Health Organization. In March, the Trump administration revealed plans to shrink the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 a major overhaul that impacted thousands of employees. Part of his plans to slash federal spending also included the suspension of U.S. foreign aid assistance, essentially gutting the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID.",
      "Last week, a senior official with the Office of Management and Budget said Mr. Trump's proposed budget for fiscal year 2026 also includes \"enormous cuts to foreign aid,\" focusing more on \"targeted\" foreign aid in situations when it's in the interest of the U.S.",
      "The Gates Foundation isn't large enough to replace U.S. foreign aid. In fiscal 2024 alone, the U.S. federal government disbursed nearly $72 billion in foreign aid, according to the Pew Research Center, which cited ForeignAssistance.gov. The U.S. federal government spent four times more on global health than the Gates foundation, Gates said.",
      "\"You always want more money going into these things where you're saving lives for a few thousand dollars. And I will be an advocate for that,\" said Gates, praising global health initiatives spearheaded by former President George W. Bush \u2014 like his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 \u2014 which he says should be maintained.",
      "\"The last stage\" of a long career",
      "Gates, who is turning 70 years old this fall, said this move marks the beginning of the \"last chapter\" in his career. But he certainly hopes he's around to see the impact it makes.",
      "\"Well, I wish I had even more time. But I have to say, 'OK, this is the last part of my life. And I'm a steward of these resources,'\" he told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I should make sure that it's well spent. And now this is the last stage of all that.\"",
      "When asked if he'll miss his billion-dollar fortune, Gates chuckled.",
      "\"No, I won't. I hope I'm still alive when we finish the 20 years, but I will save a little bit to be able to buy hamburgers as much as I need,\" he said.",

Many of these artificial intelligence-backed profiles are gaining followers faster than real disability advocates \u2014 and they're making money from it.",
      "These fake accounts use feel-good messages, dance to trending songs, and thank their followers for supporting their journeys.",
      "One video is captioned, \"Be proud of yourself and your differences!\"",
      "\"So grateful I never gave up on my dream,\" reads another post.",
      "But the people featured in these accounts aren't real.",
      "CBS News Confirmed identified more than 30 accounts impersonating people with Down syndrome across Instagram, YouTube and TikTok. Some used deepfakes or AI faceswaps. Others mimicked real disability advocates' language and repackaged it to pass as authentic. Only a few accounts disclosed the use of AI.",
      "AI for clicks and cash",
      "Down syndrome communities have built strong followings on social media, using well-known hashtags like #DownSyndrome and #DownSyndromeAwareness to connect and share their stories. Imposters exploit those same tags to appear alongside real advocates.",
      "Many of the imposter accounts identified by CBS News posted videos on TikTok and Instagram using flirty or emotional captions to grab attention.",
      "\"A girl with Down syndrome can also go clubbing to flirt!\" text superimposed on one post reads.",
      "Other accounts shared videos responding to fabricated criticism in order to boost engagement and go viral.",
      "One account, calling itself \"the NUMBER 1 DS creator\ud83e\udd47,\" used its profile \u2014 populated with Down syndrome content and having more than 130,000 followers \u2014 to promote her content on an adults-only site. CBS News reached out to the account's owner, who went by the name \"Sara\" and said, \"Yeah, I make good money from it.\"",
      "Another well-known account, with more than 100,000 followers, claimed to raise money for the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS), one of the nation's leading advocacy groups. But the videos it shared featured a face that looked blurry and distorted, with telltale signs of AI. An NDSS spokesperson told CBS News they did not know this person and did not ask them to raise funds for the group. The account was later taken down.",
      "AI impersonators stealing others' stories is \"not right\"",
      "For people with Down syndrome, these fake accounts can feel like a new level of discrimination \u2014 one where their lived experiences are copied, exaggerated and monetized.",
      "\"It's not right to steal our stories just to get attention online,\" said Alex Bolden, who works for NDSS.",
      "Bolden, who has Down syndrome himself, told CBS News he's spent years working to build his 24,000 followers on Instagram \u2014 a number some impersonators have achieved in just a few months.",
      "\"Those are our stories. I work so hard to advocate and share my journey online and I can't believe people would try to take that away from me,\" he said.",
      "\"It's a disturbing trend,\" Michelle Sagan, who leads communications at NDSS, told CBS News. \"I've seen my friends' faces used in AI posts more than once.\"",
      "Approximately 5,700 people are born with Down syndrome every year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "At their annual advocacy conference held in Washington, D.C., last week, multiple advocates agreed that only individuals with Down syndrome should be the ones to tell their stories.",
      "\"While there are many reasons why these fake accounts are wrong, the principle here is that individuals with Down syndrome are the only people who should be speaking about what it's like to have Down syndrome,\" NDSS President & CEO Kandi Pickard told CBS News.",
      "She said these influencers are not only impersonating someone's identity, but also exploiting a community that's already fighting to be heard.",
      "\"There is still so much work to be done to ensure that individuals with Down syndrome are included and respected in society,\" Pickard said.",

      "Each platform found that the accounts pointed out by CBS News had violated their policies, and removed or banned them after our inquiries. But many others still exist.",
      "Stopping the spread of AI-generated accounts is a moving target, as even when an account is taken down, another one can quickly appear. And, unlike real creators, these fake influencers don't need rest or time off. They generate new content instantly, flooding feeds and pushing real people on social platforms deeper into the margins.",

      "America's most European city is buzzing over the news that the Catholic Church's new pope is not only from the U.S. but also has Haitian and Creole ancestors from New Orleans.",
      "While Pope Leo XIV was born in Chicago, Illinois, records show that his family lineage has deep roots in Louisiana. When his maternal great-grandmother was just a baby, she was baptized in 1840 at the city's iconic St. Louis Cathedral in Jackson Square, the New Orleans Archdiocese said.",
      "A couple of decades later, the pope's maternal great-grandparents \u2014 Ferdinand D. Baquie and Eugenie Grambois \u2014 married on Sept. 19, 1864, in New Orleans' St. Mary's Church on Chartres Street, according to the New Orleans Archdiocese's sacramental records.",
      "According to records from the Vital Records Collection at the Louisiana State Archives, Leo's great-grandparents' death certificates show they died in Louisiana, as well.",
      "A marriage certificate from the Louisiana State Archives shows Leo's maternal grandparents \u2014 Joseph N. Martinez and Louise Baquie \u2014 married in New Orleans on Sept. 17, 1887.",
      "Historians say the pope's grandparents moved to Chicago in the early 1900s and they remained married for over 50 years.",
      "Jari Honora, family Historian with the Historic New Orleans Collection, was the first to discover the pontiff's family ties.",
      "\"I was just thrilled and almost in disbelief that the pope would have a New Orleans connection,\" Honora said.",
      "Louisiana State Archives records also show the pope's maternal grandmother identified as being from New Orleans and his grandfather identified as being a native of Haiti.",
      "He says the pontiff's maternal grandfather, Joseph Martinez, was later listed as being from the Dominican Republic. However, in the earliest census records in which he appears, Martinez and his entire household were listed as being from Louisiana.",
      "\"It causes you to wonder, maybe there was sort of a conscious memory of some Haitian ancestry that he was speaking to, or maybe he really thought that he had been born in Haiti, or maybe there was even early on, an attempt to sort of obfuscate the true origins of the family,\" Honora said. \"I can tell you that by the time they get to Chicago, there's one census where he's listed as Maltese, which is not correct.\"",
      "Honora \u2014 a Creole Catholic himself \u2014 said the choice of such a multi-cultural pontiff is a special moment for the city of New Orleans and for Creole culture.",
      "\"It highlights the role that Catholics of color, that Black Catholics have always played, in the church since the very beginning,\" Honora said. \"We sort of take for granted here on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana in particular, that there are Catholics of color, there are Black Catholics in the church.\"",
      "Honora said he's still researching whether the new highest leader of the Catholic Church has ancestors who were once enslaved.",
      "\"I'm quite confident that we will get there on at least one line, and I say only one line... documenting enslaved ancestors is a totally different experience than some of the more contemporary research, say, 20th century or late 19th century research, where you have widespread adherence to vital records laws,\" Honora said. \"Prior to the 1870 census, after the Civil War, enslaved people are not listed in the census by name at all \u2014 there are only tick marks, check marks on slave schedules.\"",
      "Honora noted that Pope Leo's love of cooking, and that of his mother, is likely something passed down from their Creole roots.",
      "\"That was one of the things that I read in interviews that the Holy Father did long before he was even a candidate for the papacy is that he was open to a vocation, because the neighborhood priests from the surrounding parishes, they were always in his home, because they loved his mother's cooking, and now we know why: because she was a New Orleans cook,\" Honora said.",
      "People in the Big Easy said it's exciting to see a pope with Louisiana Creole roots.",
      "\"I think if there was going to be a first American pope, this is a very good person to take on that role, it feels like a good representation, but also, he seems like someone that it seems like is going to represent the interests of a lot of Americans, more so than other cardinals might have,\" said Emmaline Kelly, a native of New Orleans who attended Catholic school in the city and now works at a local business in the French Quarter.",
      "She says she hopes Pope Leo will schedule a visit back to see his Creole roots very soon, and in the meantime, \"hopefully follow in Francis's footsteps, and open the Catholic Church's arms to LGBT people... providing vocal support for refugees.\"",

      "A judge temporarily barred the Trump administration from carrying out sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies late Friday, part of a massive federal cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of federal employee unions \u2014 are likely to show that the Trump administration's attempts to reorganize and downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. Illston wrote that President Trump \"likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks.\"",
      "Illston's temporarily restraining order blocks a litany of federal agencies from taking any further steps to carry out a February executive order telling agencies to draw up plans for large-scale job cuts. The affected agencies \u2014 covering a wide swath of the government \u2014 can't continue laying off staff or put workers on administrative leave in order to comply with Mr. Trump's order. The order also blocks \"any further orders by DOGE to agencies to cut programs or staff\" in accordance with the executive order.",
      "The order will remain in effect for at least 14 days while the judge considers the case.",
      "It applies to DOGE and 20 federal agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget, the Social Security Administration and the departments of State, Treasury, Commerce, Veterans Affairs and more.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to dramatically reorganize the government and downsize the federal workforce \u2014 a gambit it argues is designed to cut bureaucratic bloat and save taxpayer money. But federal unions and Democratic lawmakers view the moves as unlawful and disruptive to public services. The effort is led by Musk, whose team at DOGE has become embedded in virtually every major federal agency.",
      "The administration has already laid off or offered buyouts to thousands of staff, often focusing on probationary workers who are relatively new to federal service. Plans for deeper cuts are in the works at some agencies.",
      "In February, the Office of Personnel Management \u2014 essentially the federal government's human resources arm \u2014 ordered government agencies to make plans for a \"significant reduction\" in the number of staff.",
      "The lawsuit that led to Friday's restraining order alleges these moves are an \"unconstitutional dismantling of the federal government by the President of the United States on a scale unprecedented in this country's history and in clear excess of his authority.\"",
      "The suit argues Mr. Trump doesn't have the power to reorganize and slash federal agencies without authorization from Congress.",
      "The lawsuit also argues DOGE, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management don't have the legal authority to order sweeping government-wide cuts.",
      "The Trump administration has pushed back, writing in legal filings that \"Congress has expressly authorized federal agencies to engage in [reductions-in-force] and has done so for nearly 150 years.\" It notes the Trump administration's executive orders and memos specifically said agencies' cost-cutting plans should follow the law, and argues the administration provided \"broad guidance\" rather than dictating specific layoffs.",
      "Illston largely sided with the plaintiffs Friday, writing they are likely to show Mr. Trump, DOGE, OMB and OPM exceeded their authority. The judge also said the plaintiffs presented evidence that agencies have made cuts \"at the direction of the President and his team,\" rather than treating the administration's memos as general guidance.",
      "The Trump administration's cost-cutting drive has run into several other lawsuits. In March, a federal judge ordered the administration to rehire thousands of probationary workers. The Supreme Court later paused that ruling\u00a0while the litigation plays out.",

    "summary": "Rumeysa Ozturk was taken into custody on March 25 after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, was released from immigration custody Friday, hours after a judge ordered her to be freed on bail.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Sessions, who is presiding over the case, said at the conclusion of Friday's bail hearing that Ozturk raised \"very substantial\" and \"very significant\" claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when she was taken into custody following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa in March.",
      "\"Her continued detention cannot stand,\" he said.",
      "Ozturk was released by the government later Friday afternoon, one of her attorneys, Sonya Levitova, confirmed to CBS News.",
      "\"The government sent masked, plainclothes agents to kidnap R\u00fcmeysa off the street and lock her up for writing an op-ed. She has been a political prisoner for six weeks. Now that she's free and can resume her studies and rejoin her community at Tufts, we look forward to seeing the government in court to vindicate R\u00fcmeysa's rights in full,\" Levitova said in a statement.",
      "Ozturk was held at an immigration facility in Basile, Louisiana, where she was transferred after she was detained in Massachusetts. But the court said she can now return to her home in Somerville, Massachusetts, with no travel restrictions. The bail hearing in her challenge to her confinement came after a\u00a0federal appeals court ruled\u00a0Wednesday that the Trump administration had until May 14 to comply with a district court's order to transfer Ozturk to immigration custody in Vermont.",
      "Ozturk, who appeared remotely from Louisiana and testified before the court, was seen hugging her lawyer after Sessions delivered his decision from the bench.",
      "The Trump administration has said that the underlying justification for taking Ozturk's student visa away rested on an opinion piece she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper last year about Israel's war with Hamas. But Sessions said Ozturk \"simply and purely\" was detained for \"the expression she made or shared in the op-ed.\"",
      "\"There has been no evidence that has been introduced by the government other than the op-ed. I mean, that literally is the case,\" Sessions said. \"There is no evidence here as to the motivation, absent the consideration of the op-ed.\"",
      "He told the court that creates a \"very significant, substantial claim that the op-ed \u2014 that is that the expression of one's opinion as ordinarily protected by the First Amendment \u2014 formed the basis of this particular detention.\"",
      "\"There is absolutely no evidence that she has engaged in violence or advocated violence,\" Sessions said. \"She has no criminal record. She has done nothing other than essentially attend her university and expand her contacts within the community in such a supportive way.\"",
      "Mike Rodman, a spokesperson for Tufts University, said in a statement that the school is \"pleased that the court has approved Rumeysa's request to be released on bail, and we look forward to welcoming her back to campus to resume her doctoral studies. As we have noted previously, Rumeysa is a student in good standing, and nothing in her co-authored op-ed of March 26, 2024, in The Tufts Daily student newspaper violated either the university's gatherings, protests, and demonstrations policy or its Declaration on Freedom of Expression. We hope that she is able to rejoin our community as soon as possible.\"",
      "In addition to hearing testimony from Ozturk, her lawyers also questioned her doctor, her adviser in the doctoral program at Tufts and an official with a Burlington, Vermont, organization that offered pretrial services to Ozturk if she is released. The government did not put forward any witnesses to provide testimony.",
      "During the proceedings, and while her doctor was testifying about Ozturk's asthma diagnosis, a lawyer appearing alongside her in Louisiana said Ozturk was suffering from an asthma attack, and she was briefly excused for 10 minutes.",
      "One of Ozturk's lawyers said that she would face \"significant health risks\" if she remained in detention and urged Sessions to immediately grant her bail.",
      "Allowing her to remain in custody shows that \"you can be detained thousands of miles from your home for more than six weeks for writing a single news article,\" her attorney told the court.",
      "Ozturk alleges that her detainment violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights. She is among several hundred international students attending American universities who have had their student visas revoked after they were accused of criticizing Israel or participating in pro-Palestinian protests on their campuses.",
      "Ozturk's attorneys said that an immigration judge denied bond for the Turkish national during a hearing last month after they asked an immigration judge to release her as her immigration case proceeds. Her lawyers said the Department of Homeland Security presented one document to support their opposition to Ozturk's bond request: a one-paragraph State Department memo revoking her student visa.",
      "The immigration judge, Ozturk's attorneys said, denied bond based on the \"untenable conclusion\" that she was \"both a flight risk and a danger to the community.\"",
      "Ozturk was taken into custody by masked, plainclothes immigration authorities outside her Somerville residence on March 25 after her student visa was revoked by the Trump administration. She was not informed about the revocation before she was detained, her lawyers said.",
      "As justification for her arrest and detention, the Department of Homeland Security and the Immigration and Customs Enforcement said Ozturk \"had been involved in associations that 'may undermine U.S. foreign policy by creating a hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated terrorist organization,'\" according to court filings.",
      "Ozturk had co-authored an opinion piece that was published in the Tufts' student newspaper last year that criticized the school for its dismissal of several resolutions adopted by the undergraduate student senate as a \"sincere effort to hold Israel accountable for clear violations of international law.\" The op-ed did not mention Hamas.",
      "Tufts president Sunil Kumar submitted a declaration defending Ozturk and supporting her motion regarding her release, writing that the university \"has no information to support the allegations that she was engaged in activities at Tufts that warrant her arrest and detention.\"",
      "After Ozturk was taken into custody, she was transferred to New Hampshire and then Vermont, where she was kept overnight before putting her on a plane to Louisiana. The 30-year-old student has been detained at an immigration facility in Basile since late March.",
      "In a court filing by Ozturk, she said that she has suffered multiple serious asthma attacks in ICE detention and has received limited medical attention at the Louisiana detention center. She said that she is one of 24 people in a detention cell that has a sign stating the room has a capacity for 14.",
      "During Friday's bail hearing, Ozturk told the court that she has suffered 12 asthma attacks since she was detained, which have become \"longer and harder to stop.\" Four of them occurred since Ozturk disclosed her history to the court in a declaration last week, she said. There are \"constant triggers\" that can bring on an attack, including the room conditions at the facility in Louisiana, limited access to the outdoors and stress from her confinement, Ozturk said.",
      "\"It is affecting me in a very negative way, alongside other women living here, not accessing enough medical care and medication,\" she said.",
      "If she is released while her case is adjudicated, Tufts will provide Ozturk with housing, she said. Ozturk can continue working toward completion of her doctorate if she is let out of detainment, she told the court.",
      "Ozturk's whereabouts in the hours after she was taken into custody kicked off a battle over where her habeas petition should be filed and whether federal district courts even have the authority to consider the challenge. While initially filed in court in Massachusetts, a judge there transferred her case to Vermont, given that Ozturk was in the state at the time her lawyers filed her habeas petition.",
      "The Massachusetts judge who was assigned Ozturk's petition seeking release had swiftly issued an order barring the government from transferring her out of the state. But by then, Ozturk was in Vermont and hours later was flown to Louisiana.",
      "Referencing this initial order, Sessions called it an \"extraordinary situation\" in which a federal judge ordered the government not to take Ozturk out of Massachusetts, and then did not inform the court that she was in a different location.",
      "The Justice Department had argued that the case should proceed in Louisiana, as that is where Ozturk was confined. They had sought, unsuccessfully, to have her challenge to her detention tossed out.",
      "Sessions, who sits on the federal district court in Vermont, ruled last month that Ozturk had to be transferred from Louisiana to ICE custody in Vermont. Separate from her bail hearing, the judge will weigh the merits of Ozturk's challenge to her confinement on May 22.",
      "The Trump administration appealed that decision and asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit to block it. But the three-judge panel rejected the request and said federal immigration authorities had to transfer Ozturk to Vermont, as Sessions ordered them to do.",
      "\"Permitting Ozturk's transfer will provide her ready access to legal and medical services, address concerns about the conditions of her confinement, and expedite resolution of this matter \u2014 all of which are required, as the court below noted, to proceed expeditiously,\" Judges Barrington Parker, Susan Carney and Alison Nathan said in their unanimous opinion. \"At stake, too, is Ozturk's ability to participate meaningfully in her habeas proceedings.\"",

      "Consumer Reports issued a statement condemning the CPSC firings, and said that the commissioners should be reinstated immediately.",
      "\"This is an appalling and lawless attack on the independence of our country's product safety watchdog,\" said William Wallace, director of safety advocacy for Consumer Reports, in an email. \"Anyone who cares about keeping their family safe should oppose this move and demand that it be reversed.\"",
      "Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, and three other Democratic senators \u2014 Maria Cantwell of Washington; Ed Markey of Massachusetts; and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut \u2014 also objected to the firings in a May 9 letter to Mr. Trump, calling the dismissals \"illegal.\"",
      "\"The Consumer Product Safety Commission makes sure toys are safe for our kids and the products Americans use everyday don't have hidden hazards,\" Klobuchar said in a statement. \"It conducts thousands of investigations and issues crucial recalls .... This move is dangerous and illegal.\"",
      "DOGE firings",
      "DOGE has sought to cut federal workers in the name of reducing fraud, waste and abuse.

      "Two Amtrak employees, Devon Burt of Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and a co-conspirator, Hallum Gelzer, of East Orange, New Jersey,\u00a0 allegedly worked with health care providers to recruit Amtrak employees to participate in the scheme, the report said. They found Amtrak employees based in Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Connecticut and Washington, D.C., willing to participate, the report said.",
      "Employees accepted cash from the health care providers in exchange for using their insurance information, the report alleges. The information was then used to file fraudulent claims for services \u2014 ones that were never provided, the inspector general said.",
      "Burt and Geltzer separately pleaded guilty in June 2023 to federal charges of conspiracy to commit health care fraud as well as conspiracy to communicate extortionate threats, said the report. As part of their plea agreement, Burt agreed to pay $959,072 in restitution, while Gelzer agreed to pay approximately $1.66 million.",
      "Six other employees have also pleaded guilty to health care fraud conspiracy charges, the report stated. It is unclear who the prosecuting agency was or in which jurisdiction the pleas were entered.",

      "Mr. Trump issued an executive order declaring a \"national energy emergency\" on the first day of his presidency \u2014 part of Mr. Trump's push to expand U.S. oil and gas production. The order urges oil and gas expansion through federal use of eminent domain and the Defense Production Act, which allows the government to use private land and resources to produce goods deemed to be a national necessity.",

      "Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged in April, as steep tariffs on China make it too costly for many U.S.-based retailers to import goods from the country.",
      "President Trump ratcheted up his trade war with Beijing in April, hiking tariffs on Chinese goods to up to 145%. China retaliated with 125% levies on Americans goods.",
      "As a result, shipments of goods from China to the U.S. in April dropped 21% compared with the same period one year earlier, data released Friday from China's General Administration of Customs shows. Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by the same amount, according to the April data, demonstrating how Mr. Trump's tariffs are already upending trade patterns.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump said in a post on his social media site Truth Social that the levies on China could come down to 80%.\u00a0The lower rate \"seems right,\"\u00a0wrote the president, ahead of U.S.-China\u00a0trade negotiations set to kick off this weekend in Switzerland.",
      "While lower than the 145% tariffs currently in place, 80% levies would still make importing goods from China prohibitively expensive for many U.S.-based businesses. Many consumers, meanwhile, are unlikely to afford price hikes from steep tariffs at a time when they are already squeezed financially.",
      "Upending trade patterns",
      "Some business owners say they are skipping orders they would normally have already placed with Chinese factories, as they wait and see where tariff rates on China and other countries settle.",
      "Mr. Trump in April announced a bevy of country-specific tariffs, which he later placed on hold \u2014 with the exception of those on China \u2014 for\u00a090 days. A 10% tariff in place on all imports to the U.S. remains in effect. Businesses say the 10% baseline tax is a challenge, but far easier to absorb than duties over 100%.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday hailed his new trade pact with the U.K. as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term.",
      "Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\"",
      "While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed on other nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank.",
      "Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say.",
      "\"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\"",
      "That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said.",
      "\"Modest improvement\"",
      "The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but \u2014 with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization \u2014 remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email.",
      "The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising the chances of a recession due to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled and U.S. Treasury prices slid in the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth.",
      "Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the new\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0with the U.K.",
      "While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In a recent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains.",
      "\"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\"",
      "Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle.",
      "\"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation \u2014 even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out.",
      "\"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\"",
      "Key meeting with China",
      "The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level.",
      "\"80% Tariff on China seems right!\" the president wrote\u00a0Friday morning.",
      "But that might not be enough to cushion the U.S. from the headwinds of higher tariffs, according to experts.",
      "\"Even if we were to see a continuation of the universal 10% tariff applied and some rollback of higher levels, or in the case of China, 145%, we're still talking about a tariff rate that is the highest since World War II,\" Luschini said. \"And so it's going to have an impact at some form.\"",

    "summary": "The group of House and Senate Democrats say Trump's designation of Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations unlocks legal tools that will help address the flow of U.S.-made guns across the border with Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A group of House and Senate Democrats is urging top Trump administration officials to use the recent designation of Latin American cartels and gangs as foreign terrorist organizations to take action to curtail the flow of American-made guns across the southern border.",
      "The 14 Democratic lawmakers said in a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Attorney General Pam Bondi that the designation unlocks additional legal tools that would allow the administration to disrupt the cartels' financial networks and impose harsher penalties on entities that provide material support to them.",
      "Federal law makes it a crime, subject to fines and up to 20 years in prison, to knowingly provide material support or resources to a foreign terrorist organization. Entities that provide weapons, money, equipment or other support to those groups can face federal prosecution if found liable.",
      "\"If you want to really tackle the fentanyl trade, you have to tackle the source of the power of the people who are involved in that trade, and there's no way to do that without addressing the guns that they receive from American-made manufacturers and dealers,\" Rep. Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat who led the letter, told CBS News. \"It's a choice I would say, which is you can't actually successfully dismantle the cartels without also dismantling the gun trafficking that goes southward that allows them to send the fentanyl trafficking northward.\"",
      "The Democrats urged the Departments of Homeland Security, State and Justice to take \"immediate\" steps to stem the flow of firearms manufactured in the U.S. into Mexico by boosting interagency cooperation to dismantle smuggling rings that facilitate gun trafficking; expanding inspections at border crossings; increasing law enforcement efforts against straw purchased and gun dealers that provide material support to smugglers; and bolstering intelligence-sharing between the U.S. and Mexican authorities and other partners to target weapons traffickers.",
      "\"This steady supply of weapons coming in from the north has allowed these criminal organizations to gain control over fentanyl and human trafficking across the border and undermine Mexican law enforcement,\" they wrote in the letter. \"Put simply, if we do not stop the flow of American-made guns across the southern border to Mexico, we cannot stop the flow of fentanyl into our country over that same border.\"",
      "Goldman said the Justice Department should initiate investigations into gun makers and dealers to determine whether they're knowingly distributing and selling guns to drug cartels, either directly or through straw purchasers.",
      "\"The fact that there is an intermediary does not mean that there isn't a criminal conspiracy that they are a part of, and that the DOJ needs to use this new foreign terrorist organization-designation to apply more pressure on the gun industry to stop the flow of American guns to the cartels,\" he said.",
      "Between 200,000 to 500,000 American-made guns are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's been called the \"iron river.\"\u00a0Nearly half of all firearms recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Mexico, meanwhile, has just one gun store in the country and stringent firearms laws.",
      "An investigation from CBS Reports exposed how Americans are helping Mexican drug cartels smuggle weapons across the U.S.-Mexico border. Guns are purchased by straw purchasers in the U.S., and a network of brokers and couriers then transport them across the border and into Mexico. U.S. intelligence documents and interviews with current and former federal officials revealed that the federal government has known about the weapons trafficked by cartels for years, but has done little to stop the networks that operate in the U.S..",
      "In an effort to combat the violence wrought by drug cartels, the Mexican government filed a lawsuit in U.S. district court in 2021 against seven of the biggest U.S. firearms manufacturers and one wholesaler. Mexico is seeking $10 billion in damages from the gun industry, as well as other forms of relief.",
      "Firearms manufacturers, though, are seeking to block the suit because of a federal law that shields them from liability for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person. The Supreme Court is currently considering whether Mexico's suit can proceed, with a decision expected by the end of June.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum sought to use the suit as leverage in trade negotiations with President Trump after his administration designated drug cartels as terrorist groups and threatened earlier this year to impose 25% tariffs on Mexican imports.",
      "Mr. Trump agreed in February to a 30-day pause on the tariffs on Mexican imports after speaking with Sheinbaum. Mexico's president said at the time that the U.S. government is \"committed to working to prevent the trafficking of high-powered weapons to Mexico.\"",
      "Goldman, who served as lead counsel in the first impeachment investigation of Mr. Trump before he was elected to Congress, said dismantling drug cartels to stop the trafficking of fentanyl and other drugs into the U.S. is a shared goal with the administration and should bring collaboration.",
      "\"One component of doing that has got to be stopping the Iron River streamline of American guns going into the cartel's hands,\" he said.",
      "Goldman introduced legislation in the last Congress that aimed to strengthen border security by curbing the trafficking of U.S.-made guns and ammunition across the southern border and said he is working to re-introduce the bill in the current Congress.",
      "Joining Goldman on the letter are: Senators Ben Ray Lujan and Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Michael Bennet of Colorado, and Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, and Representatives Robert Menendez of New Jersey, Eric Swalwell of California, Seth Magaziner of Rhode Island, Lou Correa of California, Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, Jill Tokuda of Hawaii, Nellie Pou of New Jersey, Timothy Kennedy of New York and Gabe Vasquez of New Mexico.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-keen-footwear-china/",
    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 07:10:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Keen could be following other companies in sticking customers with higher prices as tariffs hit. Here's why it's not.",
    "story": [
      "Steep new U.S. tariffs on imports are rattling businesses large and small, with many companies planning to absorb the higher costs by hiking prices for customers. Not footwear company Keen.",
      "Although the midsize company, based in Portland, Oregon, operates in an industry that is highly exposed to tariffs, Keen tells customers that it will keep prices steady this year no matter how tariffs affect its costs. That's no idle pledge calculated to preserve market share \u2014 Keen has been steadily retooling the business for years to protect itself from sudden shifts in global trade and the vagaries of geopolitics.",
      "\"We have been preparing for this for over a decade. Early on, we saw the risks of being overdependent on any one country, so we made the decision to diversify our supply chain well beyond China,\" Chief Operating Officer Hari Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The 22-year-old company, with 650 U.S. employees and owned by design and brand management company Fuerst Group, has worked to reduce its dependence on Chinese manufacturing while expanding its U.S. presence and diversifying its supply chains.",
      "President Trump's tariffs are upending retailer supply chains, forcing them to devise workarounds. That can mean moving manufacturing to another foreign country with lower tariffs or investing in U.S.-based production. For small businesses, tariff-driven uncertainty\u00a0can mean shutting operations down altogether when the financials no longer add up.",
      "Shoe and clothing prices could soar",
      "Footwear companies are particularly vulnerable to the upheaval caused by President Trump's trade war, given their reliance on China, where 36%, or $9.8 billion's worth, of imported footwear sold in the U.S. is made, according to a TD Cowen analysis of international trade data.",
      "For that reason, tariffs are expected to hit footwear and apparel companies hard, and that impact will be felt by American consumers as well, according to Jason Judd, a global supply-chain expert and executive director of Cornell University's Global Labor Institute.",
      "In 2023, U.S. households spent an average of about $1,700 per year on footwear and apparel, Judd said. He expects that figure to surge 70% in the short term, to $2,800 per family, because of tariff-related price hikes. In the coming years, meanwhile, consumers are still likely to be paying more for footwear and clothing because of higher global tariffs.",
      "\"That pain will lessen as terms and sourcing patterns change, but the longer-term costs per family will still be around a $425 increase per year.\"",
      "The abrupt change in tariff policies is already rippling across the industry. German sportswear giant Adidas last month warned U.S. customers that \"cost increases due to higher tariffs will eventually cause price increases.\" And retailers across various industries, from apparel to food, have started passing some of the cost from higher import taxes to consumers in the form of\u00a0\"tariff surcharges.\"",
      "\"We saw the writing on the wall\"",
      "Today, Keen operates plants in Shepherdsville, Kentucky; the Dominican Republic; and Thailand, where it handles a third of the company's global production. It also contracts with manufacturing partners in Cambodia, India and Vietnam, all of which are subject to impending new U.S. levies. Cambodia faces a country-specific tariff rate of 49%, while Vietnam and India face levies of 47% and 27%, respectively.",
      "\"We do have 10% exposure in those countries, but the 10% tariff we're dealing with is significantly lower than what other companies are facing on products that would come out of China,\" Perumal told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Back in 2015, executives at Keen were already taking note of rising labor costs in China. Today, the company's broad supply chain helps it spread costs across the company, its manufacturing partners and their suppliers, he said. Keen, which is privately held, declined to share information on its annual revenues.",
      "\"We are making a conscious decision not to increase prices, but that's shared by our partners,\" he said. \"They share some of the costs with us, then they go to the company they buy materials from, and those tier-one suppliers share some of the costs as well.\"",

      "Pakistani officials have accused India of killing at least 36 people this week, including 26 it says died in a Tuesday night missile attack on multiple locations, which Islamabad labeled an \"act of war.\" India called those strikes a measured response to the April terrorist attack, claiming it had killed 100 terrorists at camps and other sites in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.",
      "The rivalry between the two countries goes back decades, and at the heart of the dispute lies the stunning mountainous region of Kashmir.",
      "The Kashmir conflict explained",
      "Kashmir is a Himalayan region dotted with snow-capped mountains, pristine lakes, and beautiful meadows. It was previously one of the many \"princely states\" of India, ruled by so-called maharajas, before India gained independence from British rule in August 1947.",
      "That independence, however, has never been a simple matter. As it ceded its colonial power, Britain partitioned India into two nations: Hindu-majority India, and Muslim-majority Pakistan.",
      "The migration of Hindus from the newly carved out Pakistan into India, and of Muslims from India into Pakistan, was marred by massacres and widespread sectarian violence. It is widely considered the deadliest partitioning of a nation in contemporary history.",
      "At the time of partition, Kashmir was a Muslim-majority princely state, and its Hindu Maharaja Hari Singh, chose to remain independent of the two newly defined nations. But in October 1947, when tribesmen from Pakistan invaded Kashmir, the Maharaja sought India's help.",
      "India agreed to come to his assistance, but only if Singh would let India claim dominion over Kashmir as a precondition. The Maharaja agreed.",
      "India sent its army to Kashmir, which drove out the Pakistani tribesmen and, for all intents and purposes, Kashmir became a semi-autonomous part of India.",
      "India and Pakistan's wars over Kashmir",
      "Pakistan refused to recognize Kashmir's accession to India, dismissing it as a fraud. The standoff led the two nations into their first war that same year, and it endured into 1948.",
      "India asked the United Nations to intervene. The U.N. recommended that, after the full demilitarization of the region by both armies, a vote be held by Kashmir's residents to determine its future.",
      "That was never achieved, and in 1949, India and Pakistan signed a ceasefire agreement that divided hotly-contested Kashmir into two parts.",
      "Both nations claim all of Kashmir as their own territory, but each controls only part of it. Another, northeastern portion of the region is administered by China, which has long been a point of friction between Delhi and Beijing.",
      "In 1965, the tension over the region between India and Pakistan again erupted into a full-scale war. Thousands of people were killed on both sides. About seven years later, an agreement was signed that formally established a Line of Control (LoC) dividing Kashmir, which still serves as the de-facto border between the two rivals.",
      "In 1989, a heavily armed pro-independence insurgency took root in Indian-administered Kashmir, launching deadly attacks against Indian forces. India has long accused Pakistan of training, arming and backing those militants \u2014 a charge Pakistan flatly denies.",
      "The three-decade insurgency has left tens of thousands of people dead.",
      "Pakistan has consistently denied the allegations that it supports Kashmiri separatists.",
      "In 1999, the two countries again engaged in a brief war, fought along the LoC in northern Kashmir.",
      "They almost went to war again following the deadly terror attack on India's commercial capital Mumbai in 2008, which was carried out by a militant group based in Pakistan-administered Kashmir \u2014 with, Indian authorities alleged, the full support of Pakistani security forces.",
      "India removed Kashmir's autonomy in 2019",
      "As the insurgency continued, India maintained a heavy military presence in Kashmir, making it one of the most militarized zones in the world. Indian forces have killed hundreds of separatists every year in regular shootouts across and around the LoC, but they have not managed to stop the militants' attacks.",
      "In 2016, gunmen whom India said were based in Pakistan killed 19 Indian soldiers in an attack on the town of Uri. India responded by launching what it called\u00a0\"surgical strikes\"\u00a0across the LoC, targeting alleged militant bases. Pakistan denied any Indian strikes on its territory.",
      "In 2019,\u00a0another attack\u00a0blamed on alleged Pakistani gunmen, on an Indian military convoy in Kashmir's Pulwama area, killed more than 40 paramilitary forces.",
      "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, furious over the attack, ordered\u00a0airstrikes\u00a0against Pakistan, sparking retaliatory raids and an aerial dogfight in which one Indian fighter jet was downed.",
      "Later that year, India's federal government, under Modi,\u00a0revoked Kashmir's special status, lifting the partial autonomy it had enjoyed since 1947, which granted the region its own constitution and major decision-making powers.",
      "Modi's government faced criticism for the way it revoked Kashmir's autonomy. A day before his government tabled and passed the bill in parliament, Indian forces launched a major crackdown in Kashmir. Internet, television and phone lines were shut down, and civilians were ordered to remain indoors. Dozens of people, including local politicians, were placed under house arrest as India flew more paramilitary forces into the region to maintain a security and information lockdown. Some of those restrictions remained in place for more than two years.",
      "Pakistan objected to the move and vowed to \"exercise all possible options to counter the illegal steps.\"",
      "Over the following years, as India continued to bolster its security presence in the region, militancy waned and tourism returned to Kashmir. Modi's government took credit for transforming the region from a hotspot for terrorism, into a hotspot for tourism.",
      "But last month's terrorist attack on Indian tourists in Pahalgam changed everything. It has once again put the two nations on a war footing - and the world on edge over the risk of another major conflict breaking out in already-tumultuous times, and between two nations with a long history of animosity, and nuclear weapons.",

    "story": [
      "Pope Leo XIV gave his first homily at a Mass on Friday, one day after he was selected by a conclave of cardinals at the Vatican to lead the Catholic Church. The first U.S. pope in history said he would be a \"faithful administrator\" of the church and warned against reducing Jesus to \"a kind of charismatic leader or superman.\"",
      "He delivered his homily wearing relatively simple white and gold vestments, and spoke mainly in Italian.",
      "\"There are many settings in which the Christian faith is considered absurd, meant for the weak and unintelligent. Settings where other securities are preferred, like technology, money, success, power, or pleasure,\" Pope Leo said. \"These are contexts where it is not easy to preach the Gospel and bear witness to its truth, where believers are mocked, opposed, despised or at best tolerated and pitied. Yet, precisely for this reason, they are the places where our missionary outreach is desperately needed. A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society.\"",
      "Leo also preached that, \"today, too, there are many settings in which Jesus, although appreciated as a man, is reduced to a kind of charismatic leader or superman. This is true not only among non-believers but also among many baptized Christians, who thus end up living, at this level, in a state of practical atheism.\"",
      "What else is Pope Leo going to do on his first full day as pontiff?",
      "Cardinals from the United States were expected to eat lunch with the new pope on Friday, and then they were all set to speak with the gathered international media in the afternoon.",
      "Pope Leo arrived at the Vatican as one of ten American cardinals for the conclave.",
      "What is on Pope Leo's schedule for the coming days?",
      "On Sunday, Leo is expected to lead a prayer at midday from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.",
      "On Monday, he's scheduled to hold a news conference.",
      "On May 18, in a tradition marking the formal beginning of his pontificate, Pope Leo will be formally installed at a Mass at St. Peter's Square at the Vatican. World leaders are typically invited to attend the Mass for the Beginning of the Pontificate, but most nations tend to send official delegations, rather than heads of state.",

But thanks to the time difference between Russia and Western Europe, Russia holds its Victory Day parade on May 9 every year, and CBS News was invited to witness the spectacle in Moscow on Friday.",
      "The parade was months in the planning, and the preparations and security measures taken right ahead of it closed down central Moscow for several days before the event itself.",
      "When Friday arrived, Moscow put on the show \u2014 an extravaganza of Russian troops from every branch of the military marching in unison, along with soldiers from the former Soviet Republics and a dizzying array of weaponry.",
      "There was even a guest contingent from China, Russia's increasingly close ally. In the viewing stand, President Vladimir Putin sat right next to his guest of honor, Chinese President Xi Jinping. Brazil's leader, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, was also in the crowd.",
      "On one level, the parade was a celebration of Russia's great victory over Nazi Germany in World War II.",
      "But it was also political theater of the highest order \u2014 with a weapons drive-by to remind the world that Russia is still a nuclear superpower.",
      "There were hugs and handshakes, also, with North Korean military officials, to show the Russian leader isn't squeamish about his supporters.",
      "In his speech, Putin alluded to Ukraine, acknowledging that Russia is going through a \"difficult, watershed moment in its history,\" but giving little in the way of specifics about what he calls his country's \"special military operation.\"",
      "\"All of you on front lines, are our heroes,\" he said, addressing Russian forces.",
      "The display was meant to reinforce that message, and to reassure the Russian people that the pride and morale of their military has not been crushed by the grinding conflict on Russia's western border.",
      "Over the past three years, tens of thousands of Russian soldiers have been killed, and the fighting shows no signs of letting up.",
      "So, the parade was a celebration of victory over an old enemy, but also a distraction from the fact that any military victory over the new enemy, looks a long way off.",

      "Dozens of world leaders invited by President Vladimir Putin have gathered in Moscow for the events, and the fact that our CBS News team was allowed in to witness it all shows how much things have changed in just 100 days. U.S. relations with Russia under President Trump have thawed, and American media have been invited in to see the grand spectacle of the Victory Day commemorations.",
      "Thursday brought a dress rehearsal for the main event, a lavish military parade set to take place on May 9, the day on which Russia celebrates its historic victory over the Nazis. Due to the time difference between Russia and the Western European nations where the German surrender was cemented, the U.S. and its European allies mark the Victory in Europe on May 8 every year \u2014 the day on which Adolf Hitler's forces capitulated to the Allies in 1945, ending World War II on the continent.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 May 2025 17:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says a new U.S. trade pact with the U.K. can serve as the basis for more trade deals. Economists say that could be a problem.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday hailed his new trade pact with the U.K. as a \"maxed out deal\" that will serve as a template for agreements with other nations. But some experts are taking a dimmer view, noting that the U.K. agreement suggests high tariffs are set to remain in place for the long term.",
      "Although the deal with Britain offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports. Mr. Trump unveiled that baseline levy, which serves more broadly as a minimum import tax on other nations, as part of his April 2 \"Liberation Day\" announcement.",
      "White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Friday that the president is \"committed to the 10% baseline tariff, not just for the United Kingdom, but for his trade negotiations with all other countries as well.\"",
      "While a 10% tariff rate is lower than some import duties Mr. Trump imposed on other nations last month, ranging from a high of 145% for China to 11% for the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it's still far higher than the effective tariff rate of 3% prior to the second Trump administration, according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research, a nonpartisan policy think tank.",
      "Paring Mr. Trump's sweeping tariffs to 10% could offer some relief for U.S. businesses and consumers facing higher costs. But it still represents a major headwind for importers, which pay the duties on goods and then pass on all or most of the cost to consumers, economists say.",
      "\"Even with a slow rollout of trade deals over the coming months, you're still going to have an effective average tariff rate that is going to be in the double-digit range,\" EY chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch. \"What that means for businesses is that they're simply going to be paying more for the same goods that they have been importing, and they're going to be raising prices onto customers that have much less ability to withstand ongoing price increases.\"",
      "That, in turn, could cause Americans to tighten their wallets, a serious risk given that consumer spending accounts for roughly 70 cents of every $1 in economic activity. Businesses that are stressed by tariffs could slow hiring, leading to a pullback in household income growth, Daco said.",
      "\"Modest improvement\"",
      "The deal with Britain is \"a modest improvement over what we had yesterday, but \u2014 with most U.S. tariffs still in place and very limited new U.K. liberalization \u2014 remains worse than the pre-Trump status quo,\" Scott Lincicome, Cato Institute vice president of economics, said in an email.",
      "The economic stakes for U.S. trade talks are high, with economists raising the chances of a recession due to fallout from Mr. Trump's trade war. The stock market tumbled and U.S. Treasury prices slid in the days immediately following the president's April 2 tariff announcement, underlining investor concerns that a trade war could torpedo economic growth.",
      "Stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after Mr. Trump announced the new\u00a0trade agreement\u00a0with the U.K.",
      "While Wall Street has largely rebounded since then on growing investor optimism that the Trump administration will soon strike new trade deals, many Americans are souring on Mr. Trump's policies. In a recent CBS News poll, 53% of those surveyed said they believe the U.S. economy is getting worse, while only 41% approved of the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "Even as the U.S. tries to negotiate additional trade agreements, businesses continue to face significant risks, economists note. These stem from the ongoing uncertainty over the ultimate level and duration of tariffs, making it hard for companies who depend on trade to make plans on spending, hiring and their supply chains.",
      "\"Even if this tariff is lower, this fundamental anxiety related to uncertainty and unpredictability\" remains,\" said Han-koo Yeo, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"If this is not resolved or addressed, then I think it'll be difficult for consumers, investors and business to fully recover.\"",
      "Even so, some experts note that the Trump administration's efforts to strike new trade deals could provide some relief to investors and businesses, as long as there's growing clarity about where the tariff policies could settle.",
      "\"Now, at least the wheels are in motion relative to discussions with a variety of countries, with the deal between the United States and U.K. as perhaps indicative of the fact that there could be tariff and trade-related de-escalation \u2014 even without a fully drawn out trade agreement,\" noted Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Capital Management.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox Business on Thursday that the Trump administration is \"focused on the big countries,\" although he added that negotiations could drag out.",
      "\"The president doesn't want to go fast,\" Lutnick said. \"He wants to do the kind of deal we did today, where we said, 'Look, this is just a win for America,' and we figured out how to make it a win for them.\"",
      "Key meeting with China",
      "The U.K. is a fairly modest trading partner for the U.S., representing about $65 billion in annual imports, or less than one-tenth of annual imports from China.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with Chinese negotiators this weekend in Switzerland, and Mr. Trump signaled that he's open to lowering tariffs on the nation's goods from its current 145% level.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to soon receive the first group of White South Africans it says deserve a safe haven in the U.S. because of alleged racial discrimination in post-Apartheid South Africa, government documents obtained by CBS News show.",
      "The initial arrival of the South African nationals who have been granted refugee status could happen as early as next week, according to the documents, which describe the effort as a \"stated priority\" for the Trump administration. Officials have planned a Monday press event at Dulles International Airport in Virginia to welcome the group, the documents show, although sources familiar with the effort told CBS News the timing of the plan could change.",
      "In February, President Trump issued an executive order directing officials to use the U.S. refugee program to resettle Afrikaners, an ethnic group in South Africa made up of descendants of European colonists, mostly from the Netherlands.",
      "The president claimed that Afrikaners faced \"government-sponsored race-based discrimination,\" citing a law that U.S. conservatives, like South African-born Elon Musk, have said allow racially motivated seizures of land owned by White South Africans. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination.",
      "The hastily arranged initiative to welcome Afrikaners stands in stark contrast to the Trump administration's move to ban most other refugees from entering the U.S.",
      "One of Mr. Trump's first actions after returning to the White House was suspending the American refugee admissions program, stranding thousands of approved refugees who had been identified as vulnerable individuals fleeing violence and persecution in Africa, Asia and other parts of the world.",
      "Federal courts have ruled against Mr. Trump's plan to shutter the refugee program, which Congress created in 1980 to offer refuge to those fleeing persecution because of their race, religion or political views. A federal judge recently ordered officials to resettle the approximately 12,000 refugees who were ready to travel to the U.S. when the refugee program was paused in January.",
      "The processing of Afrikaners granted refugee status has also been unusually fast. Before Mr. Trump's second term, the State Department said the refugee process, on average, took between 18 to 24 months to complete due to background checks, medical screenings and other interviews. The Afrikaners ready to travel to the U.S. have gone through that process in a matter of months or even weeks.",
      "While the State Department's long-standing program to assist refugees during their first months in the U.S. has been halted due to Mr. Trump's actions, his administration has instructed resettlement officials to use Department of Health and Human Services funds to aid the Afrikaners.",
      "The government documents show resettlement officials were told they can use funds administered by HHS' Office of Refugee Resettlement to help Afrikaners secure housing, household items and basic necessities during their first 90 days in America, including \"groceries, weather-appropriate clothing, diapers, formula, hygiene products, and prepaid phones.\"",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services confirmed in a statement on Friday that its Office of Refugee Resettlement is using \"existing infrastructure and funding\" to offer \"immediate support\" to Afrikaners.",
      "\"Initial arrivals are expected in the near term, with additional individuals anticipated over the coming months,\" the department said. \"(The Office of Refugee Resettlement) is coordinating closely with federal, state, and local partners to ensure these refugees receive the services needed to safely and successfully integrate within our country.\"",
      "In a statement, the State Department said the American Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa, has been interviewing those who have applied for resettlement to the U.S. under Mr. Trump's directive to welcome Afrikaners and that it continues to receive inquiries.",
      "\"While we are unable to comment on individual cases, the Department of State is prioritizing consideration for U.S. refugee resettlement of Afrikaners in South Africa who are victims of unjust racial discrimination,\" the department added.",

      "Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit in her daily press briefing, but did not provide details on the suit.",

      "As it stands, the gulf appears in Google Maps as Gulf of America within the United States, as Gulf of Mexico within Mexico and Gulf of Mexico (Gulf of America) elsewhere. Turner in his letter said the company was using Gulf of America to follow \"longstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions.\"",
      "Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order to change the body of water's name to the Gulf of America \u2014 and change the Alaskan mountain Denali's name back to Mount McKinley \u2014 shortly after taking office. The Interior Department later formally renamed the gulf.",
      "The executive order only carries authority within the U.S., and Mexico and other countries do not need to recognize the name change. The U.S. and Mexico both have coastlines along the Gulf, and a State Department report from the 1970s said the maritime boundary between the two countries begins at the center of the mouth of the Rio Grande and runs in a fixed line.",

      "Here's what to know about him.",
      "Where is Pope Leo XIV from?",
      "Pope Leo XIV was born Robert Francis Prevost in Chicago, Illinois, in 1955. He is the first U.S. pope in the church's history, and is also a citizen of Peru, where he worked for many years.",
      "CBS News Chicago reports he grew up in south suburban Dolton and has two brothers. A woman who knew him in childhood says the Prevost family was very active in their church.",
      "\"His family was very, very devout Catholics. I will say that. The mom and dad both were,\" Linda Jorsch told the station. \"They never missed church, and they were very active within our parish. His mom was like a member of the Altar & Rosary Society. They were lectors in their church \u2014 very active, very devout family.\"",
      "He graduated from\u00a0Villanova University in Pennsylvania with a degree in mathematics, then studied theology at the Catholic Theological Union of Chicago, where he earned a Master's of Divinity.",
      "When he was 27, he was sent to Rome to study, and he was ordained as a priest in 1982. He went on to earn a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome.",
      "\"My experience of Cardinal Prevost was that he's not a showboat.\" a seminary classmate, Father Mark R. Francis, CSV, provincial of the Viatorians in the United States, told CBS News Chicago. \"He's very calm, but extremely intelligent, and extremely compassionate.\"",
      "Pope Leo XIV has voted in U.S. elections \u2014 and weighed in on Trump administration",
      "The new pope is registered to vote in the Chicago suburbs, and voting records obtained by CBS News show he's voted in several general elections \u2014 along with both Democratic and Republican primaries.",
      "He voted in the 2024 general election, as well as in the 2012, 2008, 2004 and 2000 cycles, according to the records. He also cast ballots in the 2016 and 2012 Republican presidential primaries, and in the 2008 and 2010 Democratic primaries.",
      "The now-pope has shared posts about politics on his X account for years, in some cases reposting criticisms of the Trump administration's stances on immigration.",
      "At one point, he shared an article headlined, \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\" The article criticized the Catholic vice president for claiming Christians can prioritize love for family, then neighbors, their community, fellow citizens and, lastly, the world.",
      "What is Pope Leo XIV's background in the church?",
      "After his ordination, Prevost went to work as a missionary Peru. He returned to the U.S. for a few years and then went back to Peru, where he ran an Augustinian seminary in Trujillo.",
      "In 2014, he was appointed apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo in Peru by Pope Francis, according to the Vatican. A year later, he became a bishop.",
      "Pope Francis made him a cardinal in 2023.",
      "Before becoming pope, Prevost, who is 69, was the head of the church's Dicastery for Bishops, meaning he oversaw the selection of new bishops.",
      "Overall, he's considered a centrist, but on many social issues he's seen as progressive, embracing marginalized groups like Francis, who championed migrants and the poor. But Prevost opposes ordaining women as deacons, for instance, so he's seen as conservative on church doctrine.",
      "\"He kept a low profile on the most contentious, nerualgic, sensitive, controversial issues\" facing the church, said CBS News papal contributor Francis X. Rocca.",
      "Pope Leo XIV congratulated by presidents, Chicago mayor",
      "President Trump posted a message on social media congratulating the first U.S.-born pope.",
      "\"Congratulations to Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, who was just named Pope. It is such an honor to realize that he is the first American Pope. What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very  meaningful moment!\" he wrote.",
      "Former President Joe Biden, who is Catholic, tweeted: \"Habemus papam - May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success.\"",

This is a historic day for the United States, and we will pray for him as he begins the sacred work of leading the Catholic Church and setting an example for so many, regardless of faith,\" Obama wrote.",

      "\"Congratulations to the first American Pope Leo XIV! We hope to welcome you back home soon,\" Johnson wrote.",
      "Why did Pope Leo XIV choose his name?",
      "The first act of a new pope after he's elected is to choose a new name. This is to signify that his becoming pontiff is akin to a second birth, the Vatican said.",
      "Cardinal Prevost\u00a0chose the papal name Leo, one of the more popular choices in history, which has been used by 13 previous popes. The most recent one, Pope Leo XIII, served from 1878 to 1903.",
      "\"The name Leo harkens back to Pope Leo the Great,\" CBS News papal contributor Candida Moss explained. Also known as Pope Leo I, his papacy was from 440 to 461 and included a famous meeting with Attila the Hun where Leo dissuaded him from attacking Rome.",
      "\"What does this mean for our new pope? Well, it might mean that he too is going to stand up to oppressive political forces in the world,\" Moss said.",
      "She noted that Leo I was also known as \"a great intellectual and theological reformer.\"",
      "Bishop Robert Barron, of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, also saw it as an homage to Leo XIII and called it \"very significant.\"",
      "Leo XIII was a \"great 19th century pope,\" Barron told CBS News. \"When the revolutions in the 18th century happened, and the philosophical revolutions of the 19th century, the church initially said 'no' to much of that. Leo represents a very nuanced, intelligent engagement with modernity \u2014 not caving into it, not saying yes completely, but not saying no \u2014 using the resources of our own traditions to engage modernity creatively. That makes him a bridge figure.\"",
      "The name a new pope chooses often reflects attributes they hope to embody in their papacy.",
      "It will \"indicate a certain spirit and direction and vision of the new pope,\" said Dennis Doyle, a theologian and professor emeritus of religious studies at the University of Dayton.",
      "Pope Francis, for example, was the first pope in history to take that name, a nod to St. Francis of Assisi. In Catholic tradition, St. Francis of Assisi had a mystical vision of Jesus, who told him to rebuild his church. He also renounced his wealth and founded the Franciscan order of friars in 1290.",

      "Just weeks ago, scientists warned that a \"city killer\" asteroid had a small chance of hitting Earth. While that prediction was thankfully\u00a0revised, the planet may have to worry about another object plummeting down from the heavens \u2014 a 1970s spacecraft called Kosmos 482.",
      "The Soviet-era spacecraft meant to land on Venus a half century ago is expected to plunge uncontrolled back to Earth within hours. The Aerospace Corporation's reentry prediction map\u00a0currently forecasts the object to fall through the atmosphere at 05:54 UTC on Saturday, or 1:54 am ET, but that forecast has fluctuated.",
      "It's too early to know where the half-ton mass of metal might come down or how much of it will survive reentry, according to space debris-tracking experts.",
      "Dutch scientist Marco Langbroek, a lecturer at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, predicts the failed spacecraft will reenter around May 10. He estimates it will come crashing in at 150 mph, if it remains intact.",
      "\"While not without risk, we should not be too worried,\" Langbroek said in an email.",
      "Given its orbit, the spacecraft could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, Langbroek wrote in a\u00a0blog post. That represents a vast area, including the United States, South America, Africa, Australia, and most of Europe and Asia south of the Arctic Circle. Still, most of the Earth is covered by water so the risk to humans remains low.",
      "The object is relatively small and, even if it doesn't break apart, \"the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall, several of which happen each year. You run a bigger risk of getting hit by lightning in your lifetime,\" he said.",
      "The chance of the spacecraft actually hitting someone or something is small, he added. \"But it cannot be completely excluded.\"",
      "Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics at Harvard & Smithsonian, told NPR that the spacecraft is making its \"final death plunge.\"",
      "\"I expect it'll have the usual one-in-several-thousand chance of hitting someone,\" McDowell wrote last month. \"No need for major concern, but you wouldn't want it bashing you on the head.\"",
      "Kosmos 482 launched in 1972",
      "The Soviet Union launched Kosmos 482 in 1972, one of a series of Venus missions. But it never made it out of Earth's orbit because of a rocket malfunction.",
      "Most of it came tumbling down within a decade. But Langbroek and others believe the landing capsule itself \u2014 a spherical object about 3 feet in diameter \u2014 has been circling the world in a highly elliptical orbit for the past 53 years, gradually dropping in altitude.",
      "It's quite possible that the 1,000-pound-plus spacecraft will survive reentry. It was built to withstand a descent through the carbon dioxide-thick atmosphere of Venus, said Langbroek.",
      "Experts doubt the parachute system would work after so many years. The heat shield may also be compromised after so long in orbit.",
      "It would be better if the heat shield fails, which would cause the spacecraft to burn up during its dive through the atmosphere, McDowell said in an email. But if the heat shield holds, \"it'll reenter intact and you have a half-ton metal object falling from the sky.\"",

The cardinal electors gathered for the papal conclave elected an American from among their own ranks on Thursday to serve as the new pontiff. Chicago-born\u00a0Cardinal Robert Prevost\u00a0was elected and accepted his fate as the next Bishop of Rome, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics. He chose Leo XIV as his papal name.",
      "While the relative youth of the nation, fewer than 20 of the church's previous popes had served after the U.S. Declaration of Independence in 1776, one prominent U.S. bishop offered a possible explanation for the lack of an American leader of the world's Catholics a day before his election.",

So, I think there's some truth to that, that we're such a superpower and so dominant, they don't wanna give us, also, control over the church.\"",

      "\"The defense is essentially arguing that the relationship with Victim 1 was volatile on both sides, so it shouldn\u2019t be seen as one-sided abuse or coercion,\" Nieves explained. \"That might sound plausible at first, but in court, mutual violence doesn\u2019t automatically cancel out claims of coercion. The focus will be on who held the power in the relationship. If Diddy controlled the situation through money, status, threats or manipulation, then any violence from the other party won\u2019t excuse or equalize that dynamic.\"",

This approach might raise some questions in the jury\u2019s mind, but it\u2019s a strategy that depends heavily on context and credibility.\"",

      "\"The church's first reaction [to these changes] was very negative. It was a great \u2018no\u2019 to modernity. By the end of the 19th century, I think, with a certain distance and a certain critical intelligence, the church was willing to enter into a more, call it, creative engagement with modernity. And I think Pope Leo the 13th represents precisely that,\" Barron said.",

      "BEARS STAR CALEB WILLIAMS ISSUES TWO-WORDED REACTION TO POPE LEO XIV'S ELECTION",
      "\"In that document, [Leo XII] is a fierce opponent of Marxism, a fierce opponent of socialism and communism, a great defender of private property and of the market economy,\" Barron said. \"So you say, 'Okay, there's that great \u2018no\u2019 to the left-wing economic revolutions.' At the same time, in that same letter, [Leo XII] comes out strongly in favor of the right to form unions. He comes out very strongly in favor of what we call the universal destination of goods.\"",

But notice the lovely balance in that letter between \u2018yes\u2019 to private property, the great \u2018no\u2019 to socialism and Marxism, but the great \u2018yes\u2019 to the universal destination of goods.

      "A neurosurgical microrobot. (Robeaut\u00e9)",
      "The challenges of brain surgery today",
      "Brain surgery is incredibly complex. The tools surgeons use today are often rigid and can only move in straight lines. This limits where they can safely operate. Many tumors or problematic areas in the brain are simply too risky to reach because they lie near regions responsible for critical functions like movement or speech.",
      "In some cases, surgeons have no choice but to leave tumors untreated because the risk of damage is too high. On top of that, many drugs cannot even reach certain parts of the brain because of the blood-brain barrier, leaving patients with limited treatment options.",
      "A neurosurgical microrobot. (Robeaut\u00e9)",
      "TEEN GOES FROM 10 NIGHTLY SEIZURES TO ZERO WITH BRAIN IMPLANT",
      "How the microrobot works",
      "Robeaut\u00e9\u2019s microrobot is designed to overcome these challenges. It is incredibly small, about three millimeters long, roughly the size of a grain of rice, and it enters the brain through a tiny incision just a millimeter wide. Unlike traditional tools, this robot does not move in straight lines. Instead, it can follow curved paths, gently pushing aside brain tissue as it goes. It uses rotating silicone rings at its tip to carefully shift tissue without causing damage. This movement is inspired by how tiny insects walk on water, using adhesion forces that dominate at such small scales.",
      "Inside the robot, there is a small compartment that holds miniature surgical tools. For example, when performing a biopsy, the microrobot uses a flexible needle and tiny forceps to collect tissue samples. These samples can be stored inside the device or pulled back through a cable connected to the robot. Beyond biopsies, the robot can also implant electrodes for conditions like Parkinson\u2019s disease or deliver drugs directly to tumors. It even has sensors that send real-time information back to the surgeons, helping them monitor the procedure closely.",
      "What is really impressive is how the robot\u2019s path is planned. Using MRI scans combined with artificial intelligence, surgeons can map out safe routes that avoid sensitive brain areas. During surgery, they can adjust the robot\u2019s position in real time using ultrasound imaging mounted on the skull, achieving sub-millimeter precision.",

      "Looking ahead: Trials and future plans",
      "So far, the microrobot has been tested in preclinical trials, mainly on sheep, with very promising results. There were no major complications like bleeding, which suggests the device can safely navigate brain tissue. Robeaut\u00e9 plans to begin human clinical trials in 2026, focusing on microbiopsies of brain tumors. They also aim to expand into the U.S. market and seek FDA approval, with hopes of launching internationally by 2030.",

      "The potential impact of this microrobot is huge. It could allow doctors to diagnose brain tumors earlier and treat them more effectively while reducing the risks associated with traditional surgery. Because it is minimally invasive, patients could experience faster recoveries and fewer side effects. Additionally, the ability to collect live data from inside the brain could accelerate research and drug development for neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s.",

It tackles one of the most difficult challenges in healthcare: how to safely access and treat the brain.

      "Cybercriminals aren't just going after big targets anymore.",
      "They're going after everyone, and they're doing it with infostealer malware. These small, sneaky programs are quietly stealing passwords, browser data and login tokens from everyday devices.",

      "The industrialization of credential theft",
      "In 2024, cybersecurity researchers at Fortinet observed a staggering surge in stolen login data being traded on the dark web. Over 1.7 billion credentials were harvested not from old breaches but through active infections on users\u2019 devices.",
      "At the heart of this epidemic is a class of malware called infostealers, which are programs designed specifically to extract sensitive information like usernames, passwords, browser cookies, email logins, crypto wallets and session tokens. Unlike large-scale data breaches that target centralized databases, infostealers operate on individual machines. They don\u2019t break into a company\u2019s servers; they compromise the end user, often without the victim ever noticing.",
      "These logs are then aggregated and sold by initial access brokers, intermediaries who sell compromised credentials and access tokens to other cybercriminal groups, including ransomware operators. The market has matured to the point where access to a corporate VPN, an admin dashboard or even a personal bank account can be purchased at scale, with verified functionality and region-specific pricing.",
      "Fortinet\u2019s 2025 Global Threat Landscape Report identified a 500% increase in credential logs from infostealer infections over the past year. Among the most widespread and dangerous infostealers identified in the report are RedLine, Vidar and Raccoon.",

      "How infostealers work",
      "Infostealers are typically distributed through phishing emails, malicious browser extensions, fake software installers or cracked applications. Once installed on a device, they scan browser databases, autofill records, saved passwords and local files for any credential-related data. Many also look for digital wallets, FTP credentials and cloud service logins.",
      "Crucially, many infostealers also exfiltrate session tokens and authentication cookies, meaning that even users who rely on multifactor authentication are not entirely safe. With a stolen session token, an attacker can bypass multifactor authentication entirely and assume control of the session without ever needing to log in manually.",
      "Once collected, the data is uploaded to a command and control server. From there, it's either used directly by attackers or bundled into logs and sold on forums. These logs can include everything from the victim\u2019s IP address and geolocation to their browser fingerprint and full credential list, giving attackers everything they need to carry out further exploitation or impersonation.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from infostealer malware",
      "With infostealer malware becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Many infostealers target saved passwords in web browsers. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager. Our No. 1 pick has a\u00a0built-in\u00a0Data Breach Scanner that lets you check if your information has been exposed in known breaches.\u00a0Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.",
      "These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "The 1.7 billion passwords leaked in 2024 are not a relic of past breaches. They\u2019re evidence of an evolving, industrialized cybercrime economy built on the backs of unsuspecting users and quietly infected devices. The tools are cheap, the scale is massive and the impact is personal.

      "How it works",
      "The\u00a0Looking Glass 27 uses light-field display technology, which projects multiple perspectives of an object simultaneously. This allows for \"Super Multi View\" experiences, where everyone around the screen can see a slightly different angle, just like in the real world. It\u2019s a step beyond traditional 3D displays, offering richer depth cues and a more natural viewing experience.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

      "The display sits at just an inch thick but packs a punch with 5K resolution (5,120 x 2,880 pixels) at 60 Hz, delivering up to 16 inches of virtual depth and 8-bit color. The result? Real-time 3D visuals that look and feel like they\u2019re actually present in the room.",
      "But what really sets this display apart is its ability to create a shared 3D experience. Unlike traditional VR or AR setups that require each participant to wear a headset, the Looking Glass 27 can project up to 100 unique perspectives across a 53-degree viewing cone. This means a team can gather around a single screen and see the same digital object from different angles, just as they would with a real-world prototype or artifact.",

      "Looking Glass has made it easier than ever for developers and enterprises to build, test and deploy 3D applications. Content creation starts on a computer running Unity, but the finished product can be deployed on an iPad, which also powers the display and serves as its interface. This approach reduces system costs by about 35% compared to previous models and makes deployment far more flexible. The display also supports Blender, Unreal Engine, WebXR and Looking Glass\u2019 own Studio and Bridge tools, making it compatible with a wide range of 3D workflows.",
      "The display is designed for versatility. It can sit on a desk or be mounted on a wall, and it\u2019s available in both portrait and landscape configurations (though you\u2019ll need to pick one when ordering). The software ecosystem allows for quick creation of 3D apps using Unity templates, and content can be managed just like any other iOS application, streamlining updates and deployment.",

Imagine medical students exploring a virtual anatomy lesson together or design teams collaborating on a 3D prototype without the hassle of headsets.

      "Good news for Fred and other retired military members: Defense Department-issued IDs, including Common Access Cards, Uniformed Services ID cards and older retiree and family member cards, are still accepted by TSA for domestic airline travel. This includes cards with \"INDEF\" (indefinite) expiration dates, despite past confusion and software glitches.",
      "However, travelers have reported occasional issues at some airports, where TSA's system may misread the \"INDEF\" date as expired. In those cases, TSA officers may ask for another acceptable form of ID, such as a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or a passport. If you have no other ID, a supervisor may review your document and allow you to proceed, but expect possible delays.",

      "HOW TO MINIMIZE YOUR DIGITAL FOOTPRINT WHEN YOU TRAVEL",
      "What happens if you don't have a REAL ID yet?",
      "If you show up at the airport today with a standard driver's license that isn't REAL ID compliant, and you don't have a passport or other approved ID, you could face delays, extra screening or even be denied entry at the security checkpoint. TSA is urging travelers to check their IDs before heading to the airport.",
      "However, if you have a valid Global Entry card, you do not need to obtain a REAL ID-compliant driver's license to fly domestically after May 7, 2025. The Global Entry card is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Trusted Traveler card that meets federal identification standards and is explicitly accepted by TSA as an alternative to a REAL ID. This means you can use your Global Entry card at TSA checkpoints to verify your identity when flying within the United States. Other DHS Trusted Traveler cards, like NEXUS, SENTRI and FAST, are also accepted as alternatives.",
      "Important:\u00a0Although the Global Entry card is officially accepted, some travelers have reported occasional confusion among TSA agents. To avoid delays, consider carrying an additional form of ID, such as a U.S. passport or passport card.",

      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "BIG RIGS DELIVER CARGO WITH NO HUMANS AT THE WHEEL",
      "How safe are these trucks?",
      "The safety of autonomous trucks is a primary concern.\u00a0Aurora's 2025 Driverless Safety Report outlines five key principles to ensure safe operation: proficiency, fail-safety, continuous improvement, resilience and trustworthiness. The company uses high-resolution cameras, radar and lidar to understand the environment, with their FirstLight lidar detecting objects from over 1,470 feet away, offering nearly nine seconds of reaction time at highway speeds.",
      "Aurora's fail-safe system includes multiple redundancies, while the company's approach to continuous improvement involves regular software updates and incident reviews. They've driven over 2.6 million miles autonomously, hauling over 9,500 commercial freight loads with a nearly 100% on-time rate and no major safety incidents.",
      "Safety case and validation",
      "Aurora's safety approach is evaluated through a \"safety case\" method, commonly used in aviation and nuclear industries. A third-party audit by T\u00dcV S\u00dcD validated Aurora's safety management system, confirming alignment with SAE International's level 4 and level 5 standards.

      "\"Simulations and supervised testing aren't enough,\" OOIDA states.\u00a0\"Phantom braking and unpredictable road conditions make autonomous trucks a risky proposition. Until there's mandatory, transparent oversight, these safety claims are premature.\"",
      "OOIDA also criticizes the lack of robust federal regulation, pointing to voluntary data programs like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) AV TEST as inadequate.",

He also noted that \"Teamsters are professional drivers who safely handle all conditions with miles driven in the real world.\"",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a\u00a0Second Amended Standing General Order 2021-01 requiring manufacturers and operators of vehicles with automated driving systems (ADS) or level 2 advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) to report crashes to the agency.",
      "This order mandates the reporting of specific crash-related information when ADS or level 2 ADAS is engaged or was recently in use, enabling NHTSA to monitor potential safety defects in these vehicles and ensure compliance with safety standards. The goal is to proactively address safety concerns related to these technologies as they evolve, in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.",
      "Driverless big rig robotruck (Aurora)",
      "What this means for the future",
      "There are undeniable upsides. Autonomous trucks could operate 24/7, slash delivery times, reduce costs and help address the growing driver shortage. They may even improve road safety by eliminating accidents caused by human error. But risks remain. Public trust in driverless tech is still shaky. Many worry about what happens to jobs when machines take the wheel. The Teamsters are particularly vocal about this.",
      "\"Tens of millions of people turn a key for a living, but companies like Aurora couldn't care less if they lose their livelihoods. Eliminating all driving jobs would be disastrous for our communities and the middle class,\" McQuaid said.",
      "That said, a\u00a0Department of Transportation (DOT) study from the Trump administration projected long-haul autonomous trucking could increase U.S. employment by 26,400-35,100 jobs per year as new logistics and tech roles emerge. Aurora, for its part, claims both\u00a0human drivers and AVs are needed to meet demand.",
      "Still, consistent federal regulation is lacking. DOT Secretary Sean Duffy has called for nationwide standards: \"We can't fall behind China or other countries. After safety, we need to give a wide runway for innovation.\"",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Apple's AirPlay was designed to make life easier, letting users stream music, photos and videos from iPhones and MacBooks to TVs, speakers and other compatible devices with just a tap. But now, cybersecurity researchers have revealed that this same convenience may be opening the door to hackers. A new set of vulnerabilities, collectively called AirBorne, could turn AirPlay-enabled gadgets into stealthy entry points for malware and network infiltration.",

      "A person holding an iPhone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Researchers at Tel Aviv-based cybersecurity firm Oligo\u00a0recently disclosed AirBorne, a group of security flaws in Apple's proprietary AirPlay protocol. These bugs exist primarily in the AirPlay software development kit (SDK) used by third-party manufacturers to bring AirPlay support to smart TVs, speakers and other media devices. The security flaws mean if a hacker is on the same Wi-Fi network as a vulnerable device, they can hijack it without ever touching the device.",
      "From there, attackers could move laterally within a home or corporate network, silently hopping from one device to another. They might install malware or ransomware, disrupt operations or even lock users out of their own systems. In some cases, compromised devices could be added to a botnet, a network of hijacked machines working in unison for larger attacks. And because many smart gadgets come equipped with microphones, hackers could even turn them into tools for eavesdropping and surveillance.",

      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "What is Apple doing about the AirBorne bugs?",
      "Apple has already patched the AirBorne bugs on its own devices and issued updates to third-party vendors. However, researchers warn that many third-party AirPlay-enabled products, possibly tens of millions, may never receive a fix, either because they do not auto-update or because vendors are slow or unwilling to release security patches.",
      "A striking demonstration by Oligo showed how easily a Bose speaker was taken over to display the firm's logo, proving how simple it could be for a hacker to silently gain control. Though Bose was not specifically targeted, the example highlights the broader risk. Any unpatched device using AirPlay SDK could be a gateway for malicious actors.",
      "The researchers also discovered that Apple CarPlay is affected. While exploiting it would be harder and would require Bluetooth or USB pairing, more than 800 car and truck models are potentially vulnerable.",

      "HOW TO UPDATE ALL OF YOUR DEVICES AND KEEP THEM SAFE",
      "5 ways to protect yourself from AirPlay hackers",
      "1) Set up a separate Wi-Fi network for smart devices:\u00a0Most modern routers allow you to create multiple networks. Use this feature to keep your smart home devices such as AirPlay-enabled speakers, TVs or receivers on a dedicated \"IoT\" (Internet of Things) network. Keep this separate from your main devices, like phones, laptops and work computers. This segmentation ensures that even if a hacker gains access to a vulnerable smart device, they cannot easily reach more critical or sensitive devices on the primary network.",
      "2) Disable AirPlay when not actively using it:\u00a0AirPlay is designed to always be on and discoverable, which makes it convenient but also leaves it exposed. If you rarely use AirPlay or only use it occasionally, go into your device settings and turn it off completely. On Apple devices, AirPlay settings can be found under \"General\" or \"AirPlay & Handoff.\" For third-party devices, check their companion apps or manuals. Turning off AirPlay removes it as an open door for attackers.",
      "3) Avoid using AirPlay on public or unsecured Wi-Fi and use a VPN:\u00a0One of the key conditions for exploiting AirBorne vulnerabilities is that the attacker must be on the same Wi-Fi network as the target device. This makes public Wi-Fi networks in places like caf\u00e9s, airports, hotels or shared workspaces particularly risky. If you need to use your device in such environments, avoid casting, streaming or pairing with smart devices.",
      "Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Strengthen and secure your home Wi-Fi network:\u00a0Make it more difficult for attackers to gain access to your home network. Use a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi that is different from your other account credentials. Ensure that your router firmware is updated and that encryption is set to WPA2 or WPA3. Avoid older and less secure options like WEP or open networks. Turn off features like WPS, which are designed for easy setup but can also make your network more vulnerable. If possible, disable universal plug and play (UPnP) and similar features that make all devices on your network easily discoverable. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Limit device permissions and exposure:\u00a0Smart devices with AirPlay support often include features like microphones, auto-pairing and remote access. Review each device's settings and disable any features you do not actively use. For example, if your smart speaker has a microphone, but you never use voice commands, turn off the microphone or cover it. The fewer functions a device has exposed, the fewer opportunities a hacker has to exploit it. If your router supports it, use device-level firewall rules to limit which services or internet connections your smart gadgets can access.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Apple likes to market itself as the go-to for privacy and security, but the AirBorne vulnerabilities show that the company's devices are far from bulletproof. While they patched their own products, millions of third-party AirPlay devices are still wide open to attack. It's becoming clear that Apple's control over its ecosystem isn't as tight as they'd like you to believe. If they really want to be the privacy leader, they need to step up and fix these issues across the board, not just when it suits them.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 May 2025 10:00:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Tech expert Kurt \u201cCyberGuy&quot; Knutsson reports that Tesla owners are facing threats as hackers weaponize leaked data. Are you next?",
    "story": [
      "A 35-year-old man is accused of arson after a Cybertruck was burned at a Tesla dealership in Mesa, Ariz., on April 28, 2025. (KSAZ-TV)",
      "The recent surge of attacks on Tesla owners, dealerships and charging stations has morphed into a broader campaign of intimidation, fueled by weaponized personal data. But the fallout isn't limited to Tesla owners alone.",
      "Sites like \"Dogequest\" have published names, addresses and phone numbers supposedly belonging to Tesla owners, yet many victims never owned a Tesla or sold theirs years ago. Some were misidentified due to errors in public records or outdated databases, turning ordinary people into targets for harassment and threats. The site's operators have even demanded proof of sale from anyone seeking removal, putting the burden on innocent people to clear their names.",
      "As the DOJ and FBI label these attacks as domestic terrorism and ramp up investigations, the chilling reality is that anyone, even those only suspected of owning a Tesla, can find themselves exposed and at risk.",

      "A Tesla supercharger (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How innocent people get caught in the crossfire",
      "On March 18, 2025, a hacker group launched \"Dogequest,\" a website featuring a searchable map of supposed Tesla owners and employees. The site didn't just list dealerships and charging stations; it exposed names, home addresses, phone numbers and emails, sometimes even in real time. The twist? Many of the people listed never owned a Tesla at all.",
      "The data fueling this attack came from public vehicle registration records and third-party databases, notorious for their inaccuracies. Some victims had sold their Teslas years ago. Others were never owners, just mistakenly linked by a typo, a recycled phone number or a database error. Yet they found themselves on a digital hit list, with their privacy and safety at risk.",
      "The real-world consequences",
      "This isn't just an online problem. Firebombings at showrooms, bullets through dealership windows and threats to families have all been linked to these doxxing campaigns. Law enforcement, including the DOJ, now calls it domestic terrorism. And because the data is so often wrong, anyone could be next, regardless of whether you've ever set foot in a Tesla.",
      "\"Doxxing\" affecting Tesla and non-Tesla owners alike (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why misidentification matters to everyone",
      "If you think you're safe because you don't own a Tesla, think again. The same flawed data sources that misidentified Tesla owners exist for countless other products, memberships and affiliations. Today, it's electric cars; tomorrow, it could be political donors, healthcare workers or anyone else whose data is bought and sold.",
      "HERTZ DATA BREACH EXPOSES CUSTOMER INFORMATION",
      "What you can do to protect yourself now",
      "Whether your personal data was exposed in a breach, leaked by someone with inside access or scraped from people-finder sites, you're at risk, not just if you own a Tesla, but even if you're misidentified. Here's how to reduce your exposure and protect yourself from becoming the next target of a doxxing attack.",
      "To help prevent your data from ending up in a breach or leak:",
      "Limit what data companies have on you in the first place. Fill in only the required fields, use email aliases and burner or VoIP numbers where possible, and use a P.O. Box in place of a street address. Provide fake details where it\u2019s practical and legal to do so.Delete accounts you no longer need. That online shopping account you used once five years ago? All that personal information is still sitting there, just waiting to be breached or leaked. Look for options like \"delete my data\" and \"delete data and close account\" rather than just \"close account.\"",

      "Also known as people-search sites, these data brokers profit by compiling detailed personal profiles that are fully searchable and available to anyone for a small fee. They're among the most dangerous sources of exposed personal information online. Fortunately, they're also some of the easiest to tackle, especially with the help of a\u00a0personal data removal service.",
      "These services send legally binding opt-out requests to people-search sites and other data brokers on your behalf, ensuring your information is taken down. Some services,\u00a0like our No. 1 pick, even offer custom removal options, where privacy professionals handle complex cases that go beyond automated systems.",
      "While no service can guarantee complete data erasure from the internet, using a trusted removal service is a smart way to automate and maintain ongoing protection from hundreds of data-hungry sites over time.",
      "CHECK OUT MY TOP PICKS FOR DATA REMOVAL SERVICES HERE",
      "Hacker at work (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Additional critical digital defenses to implement",
      "While removing your data from brokers and minimizing online footprints are essential first steps, true safety in this new era of weaponized information also requires securing our digital infrastructure against both physical and virtual threats. Here are a few steps you can take to protect your data.",
      "Use two-factor authentication: Protect your vehicle\u2019s account and associated emails with\u00a0authenticator apps rather than SMS, which is vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "Use a VPN: Mask your IP address when accessing your vehicle\u2019s apps on public Wi-Fi to prevent location tracking and man-in-the-middle attacks. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Cabin cam caution: Disable Cabin Camera Recording under Data Sharing unless essential. While Tesla claims footage isn\u2019t linked to identities by default, third-party app vulnerabilities could expose this data. Newer Teslas process cabin cam footage locally, but legacy models may still use cloud backups, so check your software version.",
      "Report doxxing or cyber harassment: If you\u2019ve been doxxed or targeted online, don\u2019t wait to take action. Report it to the FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3),\u00a0ic3.gov, or to local law enforcement, as many states have laws addressing doxxing, stalking and cyber harassment. File a police report with documented evidence (screenshots, URLs, timestamps). Also, for account-specific threats, contact Tesla customer service directly to report suspicious activity and secure your account.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The reality is unsettling but not hopeless, and while the threats of our hyper-connected world can feel overwhelming, you don\u2019t have to just hope you won\u2019t be targeted. You can take control by arming yourself with knowledge, using the right tools, building smart habits like checking your digital footprint, using removal tools and staying alert to new threats because the attackers are organized, and it\u2019s time we are, too.",

      "Kurt Knutsson discusses how a paper pill bottle could revolutionize pharmacy packaging and cut plastic waste drastically.",
      "Have you ever stopped to think about what happens to those little orange pill bottles after you finish your prescription? Every year, around 200 billion of these bottles are produced worldwide, and sadly most of them end up in landfills. In the U.S. alone, about 4 to 5 billion plastic pill bottles are thrown away each year.",
      "That\u2019s enough plastic to circle the Earth multiple times.",

      "Paper Tully Tube pill bottles (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A paper bottle that\u2019s changing the game",
      "Plastic has become the go-to material for packaging, including in medicine, because it\u2019s cheap, durable and easy to produce. However, the environmental cost is huge, and the pharmaceutical industry has struggled to find a sustainable alternative.",
      "Enter the\u00a0Tully Tube, a revolutionary new pill bottle made mostly from 100% sustainably sourced paper. Developed by Parcel Health, this isn\u2019t just any paper bottle. It\u2019s the first one to meet the strict U.S. FDA regulations for food-contact packaging, making it safe to use for prescription medications.",
      "What makes the Tully Tube really impressive is how it balances sustainability with practicality. The body of the bottle is made from recyclable and compostable paper, which means it can break down naturally instead of piling up in landfills. The cap, which needs to be child-resistant for safety, is still made from plastic but uses recycled materials to reduce its environmental impact.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "STOP SORTING YOUR GARBAGE WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY",
      "How does it keep pills safe?",
      "You might be wondering how a paper bottle can protect pills from moisture, heat or damage during shipping. The Tully Tube uses a clever three-layer construction. It\u2019s coated with a food-safe compostable layer that keeps water and humidity out, ensuring your medication stays fresh and effective.",
      "When it\u2019s time to toss the bottle, a patented pull tab makes it easy to separate the paper body from the plastic cap and neck. This means the paper part can be composted or recycled, while the plastic pieces can be recycled separately. It\u2019s a simple but smart way to make sure every part of the bottle is handled properly at the end of its life.",
      "Tully Tube (Parcel Health) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "IS THIS TECHNOLOGY THE ANSWER TO CLEANING UP OUR OCEAN'S PLASTIC PROBLEM?",
      "Why should pharmacies care?",
      "One of the biggest hurdles for sustainable packaging is cost. Fortunately, the Tully Tube is priced competitively with traditional plastic bottles, so pharmacies don\u2019t have to pay more to go green. Plus, because the paper surface is easier and cheaper to print on, pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies can customize the bottles with logos, designs or even characters to make the packaging more engaging for customers.",
      "From an environmental perspective, the Tully Tube reduces carbon emissions by about 30% compared to plastic bottles. That\u2019s a significant cut in greenhouse gases, especially when you consider the billions of bottles used every year.",

      "AUTONOMOUS TRASH-GOBBLING ROBO BOAT WAGES WAR ON WATERWAY WASTE",
      "Real-world impact",

This move is expected to eliminate millions of plastic bottles from their waste stream, showcasing how sustainable packaging can work even in industries with strict safety and regulatory standards. Their example proves that eco-friendly alternatives aren\u2019t just theoretical, they\u2019re ready for real-world use today.",

      "Kurt Knutsson: Data breaches in 2024 exposed info of millions, stressing the need for better cybersecurity.",
      "Data breaches have become alarmingly common and costly, putting sensitive information at risk. In fact, the number of data breaches in the United States jumped from 447 in 2012 to over 3,200 in 2023.",
      "Even firms entrusted with managing personal information are not immune. The latest example is VeriSource Services, a Texas-based employee benefits and HR administration provider that experienced a major data breach.",
      "The personal information of about 4 million people was exposed in this incident, and it took the company over a year to fully assess its impact, a critical failure for an organization specializing in data management, employee enrollment and HR support services that clients rely on to safeguard their most sensitive information.",

      "What happened at VeriSource?",
      "VeriSource discovered\u00a0the breach Feb. 28, 2024, when it noticed unusual activity disrupting some of its systems. The company later determined an unknown attacker had gained unauthorized access around Feb. 27, 2024, stealing data on or about that date.",
      "Somehow, it took VeriSource over a year to determine the full scope of the breach, including the identification all individuals who had their information exposed.",
      "According to the investigation, this was a criminal cyberattack carried out by external threat actors (hackers), as opposed to an insider mishandling data. The perpetrators accessed sensitive personal records stored by VeriSource. In a\u00a0sample notice filed with state authorities, VeriSource reported that the compromised information included individuals' full names, mailing addresses, dates of birth, gender and Social Security numbers (via\u00a0BleepingComputer).",

Information like your Social Security number, birth date and address can be misused for identity theft, such as opening fraudulent accounts or filing false tax returns in your name. Even beyond financial fraud, having such personal data in the wrong hands can lead to targeted phishing scams.",
      "What worries me the most is the delay in fully notifying everyone affected. VeriSource had sent out preliminary breach notices to about 55,000 people in May 2024 and then to another 112,000 people in September 2024. However, those early notifications covered only a small fraction of the approximately 4 million victims eventually identified. This means the majority of affected individuals did not learn of the breach until the final notification wave in April 2025, more than a year after the data was actually compromised.",

      "If you think you were affected by the VeriSource data breach or just want to be cautious, here are some steps you can take right now to stay safe from the data breach:",
      "1. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0VeriSource hackers have access to your name, Social Security number, mailing address and more, which they can easily use against you.\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to scam you. After the VeriSource breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "2. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the VeriSource breach, including Social Security numbers. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. You can freeze your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "3. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus. They\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "4. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per yearor more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "5. Be wary of social engineering attacks and use strong antivirus software: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birthdates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Also, never click on unexpected links or attachments in emails, texts or messages because they may contain malware or lead to phishing sites designed to steal your information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "What stands out in the VeriSource breach isn\u2019t just the scale, but the silence. When a company sits on breach data for over a year, regardless of intent, it erodes trust in systems designed to protect workers. These aren\u2019t just compliance failures. They\u2019re human ones. Four million people had their most sensitive information exposed, and for many of them, the warning came far too late. This should be a moment of reckoning for how organizations define responsibility after a breach. A timely response isn\u2019t just good PR. It\u2019s a baseline expectation. And if it takes over a year to realize the full scope of a cyberattack, maybe the incident isn\u2019t the only vulnerability worth addressing.",

      "The Parolin-brokered deal was and remains a controversial agreement between the leaders of the Catholic Church and the CCP, which has long oppressed Catholics across China.",
      "While the agreement was championed by the late Pope Francis and his secretary of state, Parolin \u2014 the Vatican\u2019s top diplomat \u2014 as a step toward \"normalizing\" Catholicism in the communist nation, experts argue it has brought dangerous consequences for the faithful.",

      "Under this agreement, all Catholic clergy are required to register with the CCP\u2019s Patriotic Association \u2014 which was created in 1957 and was long rejected by the Catholic Church as illegitimate because it required that all clergy reject foreign influence, including that of the pope.",
      "Parolin in 2019 said the aim of this agreement was \"to advance religious freedom in the sense of finding normalization for the Catholic community.\"",
      "Details of the deal remain unclear because it has been kept secret, explained Shea.",

      "The ban effectively blocks the continuation of the Catholic Church in China.",
      "\"The underground, even during the harshest period under Mao, carried out this education and evangelization,\" Shea said. \"Without being able to perpetuate itself, the Catholic Church in China could die out in a couple generations.\"",

      "Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said using the Kremlin\u2019s interpreter was \u201ca very bad idea\u201d that put Witkoff \u201cat a real disadvantage.\u201d",
      "\u201cI speak Russian and have listened to Kremlin interpreters and U.S. interpreters at the same meeting, and the language is never the same,\u201d McFaul said via email Wednesday.",
      "Having a U.S. interpreter present also ensures a more accurate written account of the meeting for the rest of the government, known as a memorandum of conversation or \u201cmemcon,\u201d said McFaul, now professor of political science at Stanford University.",
      "\u201cAt the end of every meeting that I attended, I debriefed the interpreter to make sure we heard everything correctly, to get the \u2018memcom\u2019 exactly right. You can\u2019t do that using a Russian official,\u201d he added.",
      "Not having detailed notes about the meetings could create problems for other senior members of the Trump administration, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, as they try to advance discussions, McFaul said.",
      "\u201cHow does Kellogg know what Witkoff agreed to with Putin? He only knows it through a \u2018memcom,\u2019\u201d he added.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s dealings with sensitive information as he plays a key role in trying to resolve not only the war in Ukraine, but also the conflict in Gaza and the nuclear deal with Iran, have also raised eyebrows.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s plane, which he uses to fly to Russia for the meetings, is not fitted with a secure government communications system, according to two Western officials, including one previously quoted in this article. However, the officials said he has made sensitive calls from the U.S. Embassy before boarding the plane and has a secure cellphone.",
      "NBC News approached the White House National Security Council for comment and was referred to Witkoff\u2019s team, which did not respond. The State Department has also been asked for comment.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s efforts appear to have yielded little results in ending the war, at least from Russia\u2019s side.",
      "A proposal that Trump should meet with Putin on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week was nixed because there was no movement on Russia\u2019s part toward a ceasefire, according to two administration officials and one U.S. official familiar with the planning. A meeting would have been contingent on Russia agreeing to a ceasefire in Ukraine, the administration officials said.",
      "Separately, a European official said intelligence assessments indicate Putin remains committed to maximalist goals in the war in Ukraine and has no interest in coming to a negotiated settlement.",
      "Putin has previously said he wants Ukraine to withdraw from four regions \u2014 Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 which Russia illegally annexed shortly after invading Ukraine in February 2022. He has also insisted that Ukraine promise never to join NATO, accept restrictions on the size of its army, and protect Russian culture and language inside the country.",
      "Since his last meeting with Witkoff, the White House has signed an \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d with Ukraine that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn nation\u2019s critical minerals and natural resources.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians have been cooperative, flexible, supportive and eager to move forward, but the Russians have not,\u201d said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and now a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, adding that it was \u201cstandard, basic practice that you have your own interpreter,\u201d in high-level diplomatic meetings.",
      "Ukraine, he said, had agreed to U.S. proposals on a comprehensive air, sea and land ceasefire, while extending a truce to Black Sea shipping lanes.",
      "A \u201cterm sheet\u201d with 22 proposals, including a 30-day ceasefire, has been drawn up by American, European and Ukrainian negotiators, one of the Western officials said, adding that it met Putin\u2019s demand that the U.S. will not support Ukraine joining NATO.",
      "\u201cIf Putin wants a way out, here is his way out,\u201d the official said of the proposals. Witkoff will have to present them to the Russian president, they added.",
      "In remarks published Sunday, Putin said Russia had sufficient strength and resources to take the war in Ukraine to its logical conclusion, though he hoped there would be no need to use nuclear weapons.",
      "In a film broadcast by state television titled \u201cRussia, Kremlin, Putin, 25 years,\u201d he said, \u201cThere has been no need to use those weapons ... and I hope they will not be required.\u201d",
      "Keir Simmons reported from Moscow. Carol Lee, Dan De Luce and Courtney Kube reported from Washington, D.C."

    "summary": "James Antaki, a Cornell biomedical engineering professor, recently lost a federal grant to support PediaFlow, a device to help babies with heart defects.",
    "story": [
      "For James Antaki, a biomedical engineering professor at Cornell University, the $6.7 million government\u00a0grant meant babies would be saved. Awarded by the Department of Defense on March 30, it would allow his team at Cornell to ramp up production and testing of PediaFlow, a device that boosts blood flow in infants with heart defects.",
      "A week later, that all changed.",
      "The Defense Department sent Antaki a stop-work order on April 8 informing him that his team wouldn\u2019t get the money, intended to be distributed over four years. Three decades of research is now at risk, and Antaki said he has no idea why the government cut off funding.",
      "\u201cI feel that it\u2019s my calling in life to complete this project,\u201d he said Friday, in his first news interview since losing funding. \u201cOnce a week, I go through this mental process of, \u2018Is it time to give up?\u2019 But it is not my prerogative to give up.\u201d",
      "Neither the Defense Department nor the White House press office responded to requests for comment.",
      "Antaki is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of academics nationwide who\u2019ve lost funding in a variety of fields since President Donald Trump came to office, due to a mix of new executive orders limiting what government money can support and the\u00a0sweeping grant cancellations ordered by Elon Musk\u2019s\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "One in 100 babies in the U.S. are born with heart defects, and about a quarter of them need surgery or other procedures in their first year to survive, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Worldwide, it\u2019s estimated that 240,000 babies die within their first 28 days due to congenital birth defects.",
      "An infant\u2019s heart is about the size of a large walnut. When a baby is born with a hole between the chambers of the heart, it can be a life-threatening condition.\u00a0Antaki\u2019s creation is a AA battery-sized device that uses a rotating propeller on magnets to increase blood flow, helping them to survive surgery or live at home with their family until a donor heart is available, if needed.",
      "The new round of funding Antaki expected would have supported further testing of the prototype, including placement in an animal to ensure it won\u2019t harm humans, and completion of the mountain of paperwork needed to move through the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s regulatory process.",
      "The device has received several grants over the years from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense without issue, Antaki said.",
      "Antaki began work on the technology in 2003. He was already developing a similar technology for adults at the University of Pittsburgh when the National Institutes of Health issued a call for proposals on a pediatric heart assist system.",
      "He had already been trying, without success, to interest private companies in a pediatric device. They may have declined, he speculates, because the\u00a0market is smaller\u00a0for children\u2019s medical devices than for adult ones.",
      "After Antaki arrived at Cornell in 2018, he secured research funding from the Defense Department to keep the project moving forward. He submitted a 300-page proposal last June for the next cash infusion he needed, and the Defense Department notified his team in March that it was approved, before reversing course in April, he said.",
      "A copy of the stop-work order, reviewed by NBC News, does not specify a reason why the government canceled the grant beyond that it was \u201cat the direction of the Administration.\u201d",
      "Dr. Evan Zahn, a pediatric interventional cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who is not involved with PediaFlow, said cutting funding for Antaki\u2019s research is a step backward for children\u2019s health care because there are few commercially available solutions for babies with heart defects.",
      "\u201cTechnology specifically designed for our children, particularly babies across the board, is desperately needed, so losing funding for something like that is a real loss,\u201d Zahn said.",
      "If funding isn\u2019t restored within 90 days, Antaki said, he and his team will need to begin laying off lab staff and Ph.D. students will have to change their research focus.",
      "In the grand scheme of what the government funds, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a small amount of money that could do so much good for so many people, and it\u2019s just the right thing to do. It just it kind of speaks for itself.\u201d"

      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was once the life of the party. He was known for hosting lavish and exclusive gatherings in the Hamptons, having seemingly countless celebrity pals and toasting to the good life with powerful allies in the music industry.",
      "Yet a question remains as opening statements approach next week in his federal sex-trafficking trial: Why haven\u2019t more of his famous friends come to his defense?",
      "\u201cThe music industry is fickle,\u201d said Ramal \u201cThe Hometown Heat\u201d Brown, a former hip-hop disc jockey at 105.3 KJAMZ in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \u201cEveryone wants to be around when you\u2019re on top.\u201d",
      "But when a video of Combs beating his former girlfriend Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura was aired by CNN last year, \u201cnobody wanted to be around because it could tarnish their image and name,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing around Diddy could get you implicated in the case.\u201d",
      "After the video aired, Combs apologized publicly, saying his behavior in it was \u201cinexcusable\u201d and that he took full responsibility for his actions.",
      "Combs is charged in a five-count indictment with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and faces 10 years to life in prison if convicted.",
      "Opening statements in the federal trial in Manhattan are expected to begin next week.",
      "The government\u2019s case centers on allegations that Combs forced women to participate in drug-fueled sexual encounters with male sex workers that he directed and filmed. He called the sex parties \u201cfreak offs,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "In addition to the federal charges, Combs has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct in more than 50 civil lawsuits, including one filed by Ventura in 2023 that was privately settled within a day.",
      "His attorney said the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing, and Combs has vehemently denied the allegations in the pending civil suits.",
      "The past year has seen a stark turn of events for the hitmaker, who has been nominated for 14 Grammy Awards over three decades while turning unknown musicians, such as Ma$e, Total and Carl Thomas, into platinum-selling recording artists.",
      "During jury selection last week, as the magnitude of the moment began to mount, Combs appeared to nervously look around the courtroom and asked U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian for a bathroom break.",
      "No celebrity supporters have shown up in court during jury selection.\u00a0Being associated with Combs and his federal case is risky and can only tarnish the burnished images of A-list celebrities, music experts said.",
      "\u201cPeople aren\u2019t speaking out because they don\u2019t want any level of implication,\u201d said Gerrick Kennedy, a freelance journalist and culture critic based in Los Angeles.",
      "Madison Gray, a former website editor for Black Entertainment Television, said he thinks many of Combs\u2019 associates have distanced themselves because of the heinous acts he\u2019s accused of.",
      "\u201cCelebrity friends and powerful friends scatter. Nobody wants to be attached,\u201d said Gray, pointing to similar scenarios when Bill Cosby and R. Kelly faced legal battles. \u201cWhen things are good, the parties are great, the liquor is flowing. But as soon as something goes wrong, friendships are fleeting.\u201d",
      "Rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has been one of Combs\u2019 staunchest celebrity supporters leading up to the trial, defending him online on multiple occasions and accusing Ventura, who was once signed to Combs\u2019 record label, of attempting to pressure him for money.",
      "Ye accused Ventura of attempting to extort Combs in a since-deleted post on X on March 18.",
      "Ventura responded the next day by resharing a post from the culture website Shade Room showing a screenshot of rapper Playboi Carti telling Ye to shut up. Ventura\u2019s attorney, Douglas Wigdor, declined to comment this week.",
      "Ye\u2019s comments came amid controversy over a slew of posts on X in which he made hate-filled remarks about the Jewish community and said \u201cI love Hitler\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a Nazi.\u201d",
      "Former in-house Bad Boy Records producer Stevie J has also expressed support for Combs, calling many of the civil lawsuits filed against his ex-boss \u201cbogus\u201d and saying he prays for Combs and his family every day.",
      "\u201cI never knew of an instance where you\u2019ll be guilty before you even go to f-----g court,\u201d he told the\u00a0entertainment YouTube channel VladTV. \u201cI\u2019m never going to stop being there for someone I consider to be a friend. I\u2019m not going to turn my back. I\u2019ve been scrutinized just by being a friend. I guess someone has never had a true friend before.\u201d",
      "Singer Ray J has acknowledged attending Combs\u2019 parties in multiple interviews but said he never saw any freak offs or orgies.",
      "\u201cI can guarantee you most of the celebrities that went to Diddy\u2019s parties never even heard of a freak off,\u201d he told News Nation host Chris Cuomo in November. \u201cIn the beginning it sounded really interesting and entertaining, I would say, but when you look back, where were the freak offs? From my knowledge, I\u2019ve never seen a freak off.\u201d",
      "Ventura is expected to take the stand once the trial begins, but a witness list has not been released. Potential jurors this week received a list of places and names that might be mentioned during the trial, including celebrities such as Michael B.

    "story": [
      "In the eyes of many LGBTQ Catholics, the late Pope Francis created a \u201cseismic shift\u201d toward acceptance. Now, as the world welcomes the newly elected Pope Leo XIV, these lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer faithful say they hope he will continue to move in the same direction.",
      "Marianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of the LGBTQ Catholic advocacy group DignityUSA, was in Rome on Thursday when Cardinal Robert Prevost, a 69-year-old Chicago native who holds both U.S. and Peruvian citizenship, became the new pontiff.",
      "\u201cI was actually quite excited to see that Cardinal Prevost had been elected as Pope Leo XIV and thrilled that he took the name of a pope rooted in social justice. I think what a clear signal to a hurting world that that\u2019s where his energy is going to be focused,\u201d she told NBC News in an interview Friday. \u201cI also found a lot of hope in his remarks from the balcony \u2026 where he talked about God\u2019s all-inclusive love without any condition, and where he talked about being a church for all of God\u2019s people.\u201d",
      "Jason Steidl Jack, a gay Catholic and an assistant teaching professor of religious studies at St. Joseph\u2019s University, New York, described his reaction to the election of Pope Leo, the first-ever American to lead the Holy See, as \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do see him continuing Pope Francis\u2019 legacy, especially of dialogue and synodality,\u201d Steidl Jack said, describing synodality as \u201cthis idea of journeying together\u201d and \u201clistening to one another.\u201d However, he said the new pope\u2019s election \u201cdoesn\u2019t assuage all of the fears that I have as an LGBTQ Catholic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe church\u2019s teaching, even under Pope Francis, remains incredibly homophobic, and the church goes on inventing new ways of being transphobic as it really avoids learning about trans people and their experiences,\u201d he said, adding, however, that the new pontiff seems \u201copen to dialogue and inclusion\u201d given his remarks on Thursday.",
      "Chicago resident Greg Krajewski said he\u2019s been a practicing Catholic his whole life and sings at his local parish every Sunday. However, he said, as a gay man, he\u2019s \u201ccareful who I talk to and how I present myself.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a few things in his opening speech that he gave that really give me a lot of hope,\u201d he said of Leo. \u201cThe first thing is he said a couple of times, \u2018God loves us without limits or conditions.\u2019 I think this is a really big indication that even if he himself maybe has more reservations about the LGBTQ issues in the church, he is open to those discussions. He is open to bringing us in.\u201d",
      "Track record on LGBTQ issues",
      "Leo\u2019s past comments on LGBTQ issues are limited, though several LGBTQ Catholics expressed concern about remarks he reportedly made in an address to church leaders over a decade ago. During the 2012 Synod of Bishops, then-Father Prevost reportedly lamented the challenges presented to the Catholic Church due to sympathetic media portrayals of \u201calternative families.\u201d",
      "\u201cNote, for example, how alternative families comprised of homosexual partners and their adopted children are so benignly and sympathetically portrayed on television programs and in cinema,\u201d he told\u00a0a group of bishops at the time, according to the Catholic News Service. \u201cThe sympathy for anti-Christian lifestyle choices that the mass media fosters is so brilliantly and artfully engrained in the viewing public that when people hear the Christian message, it often inevitably seems ideological and emotionally cruel by contrast to the ostensible humaneness of the anti-Christian perspective.\u201d",
      "Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Ways Ministry, which works to foster LGBTQ inclusion in the Catholic Church, called the remarks \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe pray that in the 13 years that have passed, 12 of which were under the papacy of Pope Francis, that his heart and mind have developed more progressively on LGBTQ+ issues, and we will take a wait-and-see attitude to see if that has happened,\u201d DeBernardo said in a statement.",
      "Steidl Jack said Leo seemed to have a \u201cculture warrior mentality\u201d on same-sex marriage and LGBTQ representation in pop culture back in 2012, but he expressed hope that the new pope\u2019s views have changed since then.",
      "\u201cA lot of the world has changed since 2012 \u2014 even Pope Francis changed a great deal over the course of his pontificate,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I hope that Pope Leo has been listening to LGBTQ Catholics. I hope he\u2019s been paying attention and growing, just as Pope Francis did, just as the rest of the world has been.\u201d",
      "Views on LGBTQ issues have shifted dramatically over the past decade, including the views of practicing Catholics. For example, the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study, which found 19% of U.S. adults identify as Catholics, found 70% of Catholics favor allowing same-sex couples to marry, up from 57% in 2014.",
      "Michael O\u2019Loughlin, the executive director of Outreach, an LGBTQ Catholic organization, was in Rome for the announcement of the new pope. He said the 2012 comments were disappointing but that he was keeping an open mind.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m willing to look at his wider message, which was one of peace and standing up for the marginalized,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he switched to Spanish to address his former community in Peru I thought was a nice sign that he\u2019s a man of the people.\u201d",
      "After 2012, the future pope\u2019s subsequent remarks on LGBTQ issues are sparse.",
      "In 2017, when he was bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, and spokesman of the Peruvian Episcopal Conference, he appeared to speak out against \u201cgender ideology,\u201d a term some people use to refer to transgender identities, telling local media that this ideology \u201cseeks to eliminate biological differences between men and women.\u201d",
      "Then, in 2024, a year after Pope Francis formally approved allowing Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples, then-Cardinal Prevost said the subsequent pushback from bishops in Africa highlighted the need to give more doctrinal authority to local bishops, according to CBCPNews, the news service of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of the Philippines.",
      "\u201cThe bishops in the episcopal conferences of Africa were basically saying that here in Africa, our whole cultural reality is very different. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t rejecting the teaching authority of Rome, it was saying that our cultural situation is such that the application of this document is just not going to work,\u201d Prevost said at the time, according to CBCPNews. \u201cYou have to remember there are still places in Africa that apply the death penalty, for example, for people who are living in a homosexual relationship. \u2026 So, we\u2019re in very different worlds.\u201d",
      "Hopes for the future",
      "When asked what she\u2019d like to see from Leo\u2019s papacy, Duddy-Burke said she hopes he can serve a \u201ctrusted moral voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe world is so broken at the moment in so many places \u2014\u00a0you know, this rise of nationalism, the increased xenophobia, so many wars that are very vicious happening around the world \u2014 I just hope that he can become a very clear and trusted moral voice in the world, and some of that means dealing with the inequities and failings within our own church as well,\u201d she said.",
      "Steidl Jack said he hopes Leo listens to Catholics with differing viewpoints.",
      "\u201cOne of the gifts of Pope Francis\u2019 papacy was that he encouraged church leaders to go outside of the church, to listen to people outside of the hierarchy, and that\u2019s really what Pope Leo needs to do, especially regarding same-sex relationships and transgender experience,\u201d he said.",
      "DeBernardo, of New Ways Ministry, said in his statement that he hopes Leo continues to build upon the foundation that Francis laid out.",
      "\u201cPope Francis opened the door to a new approach to LGBTQ+ people,\u201d he said. \u201cPope Leo must now guide the church through that door.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 12:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Business travel was finally making a post-Covid comeback, but recent U.S. policy swings have upended the $1 trillion industry's sunny outlook just months ago.",
    "story": [
      "Business travel\u2019s four-year crawl out the pandemic was on track to continue this year, but the U.S. trade war has scrambled that outlook.",
      "\u201cThe big word is uncertainty,\u201d said Suzanne Neufang, CEO of the Global Business Travel Association, which had forecast worldwide spending to surge to $1.64 trillion in 2025, up from an expected $1.48 trillion in 2024. Last year\u2019s estimated total, if preliminary data bears out, would mark the first time the sector surpassed its pre-Covid levels.",
      "But pessimism has risen sharply amid President Donald Trump\u2019s deep cuts to the government workforce and a dizzying range of tariffs. Now, about 29% of U.S. corporate travel managers and an equal share abroad expect business travel to decline this year due to government actions, according to a recent GBTA survey. The expected pullbacks could dent business trips by as much as 22%, the group found.",
      "Industry experts caution that souring expectations so far haven\u2019t translated to a collapse in bookings, despite signs of cooler demand.",
      "Business travel \u201chasn\u2019t fallen off a cliff,\u201d said Jonathan Kletzel, a travel, transportation and logistics leader at the consulting firm PwC. \u201cIt is definitely constrained right now, but will people stop traveling? Probably not. If you\u2019re a sales-heavy organization and you\u2019re not out in the market meeting with your clients, your competitors are.\u201d",
      "Still, growing concerns around business travel coincide with corporate leaders\u2019 warnings that U.S. trade policies have injected fresh uncertainty into an economy that just months ago looked on track to build on its strengths.",
      "Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian told CNBC last month that the carrier has had to check its expectations for what was shaping up to be the \u201cbest financial year in our history.\u201d Travel demand was growing about 10% at the start of the year but has since slowed, he said, partly due to companies rethinking business trips and cuts to the federal workforce. Other airlines have flagged similar concerns, in some cases adjusting their growth plans or scaling back capacity.",
      "Hotel operators and booking platforms are feeling it, too. Expedia said Friday that U.S. travel demand is cooling. Marriott, Hyatt and Hilton have each reduced their financial forecasts in recent weeks, with the first of those hospitality giants warning investors of \u201can expected continuation of declines in U.S. government demand.\u201d",
      "Since retaking office, Trump has overseen mass firings and spending reductions across the federal bureaucracy, with many of the changes led by multibillionaire adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency project. While some of the cuts have been halted in court, travel bookers for government contractors have weathered a hectic few months.",
      "Global Travel Associates, a Washington, D.C.-area agency that mainly serves government contractors, said travel sales slid 20% in the first quarter. Several had funding tied to the U.S. Agency for International Development, which the Trump administration gutted this spring, and those accounts are down by 75%-90%, Managing Director Tom Ollinger estimated.",
      "Some of GTA\u2019s clients switched to buying only refundable plane tickets; others canceled scheduled meetings or halted any new travel plans indefinitely, he said. In some cases, those with staffers on long-term assignments overseas were told to drop everything and head back to home base. \u201cThe organization provided them one-way tickets to return,\u201d Ollinger said.",
      "\u201cGovernment groups are not happening,\u201d said Jan Freitag, national director for market analytics at the real estate data firm CoStar. But many business meetings are still taking place, and while individual business travel is a bit softer, \u201cthat could just be people not booking as much ahead,\u201d he said.",
      "However, Freitag cautioned, \u201cshould [more] tariffs hit and corporations have less sense of where their costs are going, they\u2019ll start looking to cut costs. And the easiest place to control costs is travel and training.\u201d",
      "Navan, a corporate travel management service based in Palo Alto, California, said bookings were up in the first four months of the year from the same period in 2024, despite a slight slowdown in April.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certainly this feeling of waiting for another shoe to drop,\u201d said Rich Liu, Navan\u2019s CEO of travel. While CEOs are telling him they\u2019re \u201cfeeling the squeeze\u201d from new import taxes and other policy moves, \u201cthey still have businesses to run,\u201d Liu said.",
      "Individual business travelers seem to be getting anxious. The online travel insurance comparison site Squaremouth saw a 223% annual surge in searches for \u201ccancel for work reasons\u201d travel coverage last month, with purchases of those policies jumping 53%.",
      "\u201cThat tells us that travelers are feeling uneasy,\u201d said Squaremouth CEO Rupa Mehta. \u201cIn uncertain economic times, they want to understand the cost and value of flexible coverage before committing.\u201d",
      "The current outlook is \u201ca mixed bag,\u201d said Lorraine Sileo, founder of Phocuswright, a global travel research firm. At the moment, \u201cit looks like leisure travel will be impacted more than business travel,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cit will take longer for corporations to feel the pinch of an economic downturn\u201d than it will for vacationers.",
      "\u201cWe need to take a wait-and-see approach\u201d to see how business trips fare, Sileo said, \u201cbut there are indications that it will be a slow year for all types of travel for the U.S. market in 2025.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs was once the life of the party. He was known for hosting lavish and exclusive gatherings in the Hamptons, having seemingly countless celebrity pals and toasting to the good life with powerful allies in the music industry.",
      "Yet a question remains as opening statements approach next week in his federal sex-trafficking trial: Why haven\u2019t more of his famous friends come to his defense?",
      "\u201cThe music industry is fickle,\u201d said Ramal \u201cThe Hometown Heat\u201d Brown, a former hip-hop disc jockey at 105.3 KJAMZ in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \u201cEveryone wants to be around when you\u2019re on top.\u201d",
      "But when a video of Combs beating his former girlfriend Casandra \u201cCassie\u201d Ventura was aired by CNN last year, \u201cnobody wanted to be around because it could tarnish their image and name,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing around Diddy could get you implicated in the case.\u201d",
      "After the video aired, Combs apologized publicly, saying his behavior in it was \u201cinexcusable\u201d and that he took full responsibility for his actions.",
      "Combs is charged in a five-count indictment with sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. He has pleaded not guilty and faces 10 years to life in prison if convicted.",
      "Opening statements in the federal trial in Manhattan are expected to begin next week.",
      "The government\u2019s case centers on allegations that Combs forced women to participate in drug-fueled sexual encounters with male sex workers that he directed and filmed. He called the sex parties \u201cfreak offs,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "In addition to the federal charges, Combs has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct in more than 50 civil lawsuits, including one filed by Ventura in 2023 that was privately settled within a day.",
      "His attorney said the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing, and Combs has vehemently denied the allegations in the pending civil suits.",
      "The past year has seen a stark turn of events for the hitmaker, who has been nominated for 14 Grammy Awards over three decades while turning unknown musicians, such as Ma$e, Total and Carl Thomas, into platinum-selling recording artists.",
      "During jury selection last week, as the magnitude of the moment began to mount, Combs appeared to nervously look around the courtroom and asked U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian for a bathroom break.",
      "No celebrity supporters have shown up in court during jury selection.\u00a0Being associated with Combs and his federal case is risky and can only tarnish the burnished images of A-list celebrities, music experts said.",
      "\u201cPeople aren\u2019t speaking out because they don\u2019t want any level of implication,\u201d said Gerrick Kennedy, a freelance journalist and culture critic based in Los Angeles.",
      "Madison Gray, a former website editor for Black Entertainment Television, said he thinks many of Combs\u2019 associates have distanced themselves because of the heinous acts he\u2019s accused of.",
      "\u201cCelebrity friends and powerful friends scatter. Nobody wants to be attached,\u201d said Gray, pointing to similar scenarios when Bill Cosby and R. Kelly faced legal battles. \u201cWhen things are good, the parties are great, the liquor is flowing. But as soon as something goes wrong, friendships are fleeting.\u201d",
      "Rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, has been one of Combs\u2019 staunchest celebrity supporters leading up to the trial, defending him online on multiple occasions and accusing Ventura, who was once signed to Combs\u2019 record label, of attempting to pressure him for money.",
      "Ye accused Ventura of attempting to extort Combs in a since-deleted post on X on March 18.",
      "Ventura responded the next day by resharing a post from the culture website Shade Room showing a screenshot of rapper Playboi Carti telling Ye to shut up. Ventura\u2019s attorney, Douglas Wigdor, declined to comment this week.",
      "Ye\u2019s comments came amid controversy over a slew of posts on X in which he made hate-filled remarks about the Jewish community and said \u201cI love Hitler\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m a Nazi.\u201d",
      "Former in-house Bad Boy Records producer Stevie J has also expressed support for Combs, calling many of the civil lawsuits filed against his ex-boss \u201cbogus\u201d and saying he prays for Combs and his family every day.",
      "\u201cI never knew of an instance where you\u2019ll be guilty before you even go to f-----g court,\u201d he told the\u00a0entertainment YouTube channel VladTV. \u201cI\u2019m never going to stop being there for someone I consider to be a friend. I\u2019m not going to turn my back. I\u2019ve been scrutinized just by being a friend. I guess someone has never had a true friend before.\u201d",
      "Singer Ray J has acknowledged attending Combs\u2019 parties in multiple interviews but said he never saw any freak offs or orgies.",
      "\u201cI can guarantee you most of the celebrities that went to Diddy\u2019s parties never even heard of a freak off,\u201d he told News Nation host Chris Cuomo in November. \u201cIn the beginning it sounded really interesting and entertaining, I would say, but when you look back, where were the freak offs? From my knowledge, I\u2019ve never seen a freak off.\u201d",
      "Ventura is expected to take the stand once the trial begins, but a witness list has not been released. Potential jurors this week received a list of places and names that might be mentioned during the trial, including celebrities such as Michael B. Jordan, Mike Myers and Ye, none of whom are implicated in the case."

    "published": "Sat, 10 May 2025 11:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "James Antaki, a Cornell biomedical engineering professor, recently lost a federal grant to support PediaFlow, a device to help babies with heart defects.",
    "story": [
      "For James Antaki, a biomedical engineering professor at Cornell University, the $6.7 million government\u00a0grant meant babies would be saved. Awarded by the Department of Defense on March 30, it would allow his team at Cornell to ramp up production and testing of PediaFlow, a device that boosts blood flow in infants with heart defects.",
      "A week later, that all changed.",
      "The Defense Department sent Antaki a stop-work order on April 8 informing him that his team wouldn\u2019t get the money, intended to be distributed over four years. Three decades of research is now at risk, and Antaki said he has no idea why the government cut off funding.",
      "\u201cI feel that it\u2019s my calling in life to complete this project,\u201d he said Friday, in his first news interview since losing funding. \u201cOnce a week, I go through this mental process of, \u2018Is it time to give up?\u2019 But it is not my prerogative to give up.\u201d",
      "Neither the Defense Department nor the White House press office responded to requests for comment.",
      "Antaki is one of hundreds, if not thousands, of academics nationwide who\u2019ve lost funding in a variety of fields since President Donald Trump came to office, due to a mix of new executive orders limiting what government money can support and the\u00a0sweeping grant cancellations ordered by Elon Musk\u2019s\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "One in 100 babies in the U.S. are born with heart defects, and about a quarter of them need surgery or other procedures in their first year to survive, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Worldwide, it\u2019s estimated that 240,000 babies die within their first 28 days due to congenital birth defects.",
      "An infant\u2019s heart is about the size of a large walnut. When a baby is born with a hole between the chambers of the heart, it can be a life-threatening condition.\u00a0Antaki\u2019s creation is a AA battery-sized device that uses a rotating propeller on magnets to increase blood flow, helping them to survive surgery or live at home with their family until a donor heart is available, if needed.",
      "The new round of funding Antaki expected would have supported further testing of the prototype, including placement in an animal to ensure it won\u2019t harm humans, and completion of the mountain of paperwork needed to move through the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s regulatory process.",
      "The device has received several grants over the years from the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense without issue, Antaki said.",
      "Antaki began work on the technology in 2003. He was already developing a similar technology for adults at the University of Pittsburgh when the National Institutes of Health issued a call for proposals on a pediatric heart assist system.",
      "He had already been trying, without success, to interest private companies in a pediatric device. They may have declined, he speculates, because the\u00a0market is smaller\u00a0for children\u2019s medical devices than for adult ones.",
      "After Antaki arrived at Cornell in 2018, he secured research funding from the Defense Department to keep the project moving forward. He submitted a 300-page proposal last June for the next cash infusion he needed, and the Defense Department notified his team in March that it was approved, before reversing course in April, he said.",
      "A copy of the stop-work order, reviewed by NBC News, does not specify a reason why the government canceled the grant beyond that it was \u201cat the direction of the Administration.\u201d",
      "Dr. Evan Zahn, a pediatric interventional cardiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who is not involved with PediaFlow, said cutting funding for Antaki\u2019s research is a step backward for children\u2019s health care because there are few commercially available solutions for babies with heart defects.",
      "\u201cTechnology specifically designed for our children, particularly babies across the board, is desperately needed, so losing funding for something like that is a real loss,\u201d Zahn said.",
      "If funding isn\u2019t restored within 90 days, Antaki said, he and his team will need to begin laying off lab staff and Ph.D. students will have to change their research focus.",
      "In the grand scheme of what the government funds, he said, \u201cit\u2019s a small amount of money that could do so much good for so many people, and it\u2019s just the right thing to do. It just it kind of speaks for itself.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "A growing number of red states have expanded their school voucher programs in recent years, a trend that is likely to only spike further amid a push led by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to return education \u201cback to the states.\u201d",
      "Conservative education activists have long lauded such programs as a way to give greater control to parents and families. But public education advocates warn that the expansion of these voucher programs presents further risk to the broader school system as it faces peril from Trump\u2019s dismantling of the Department of Education.",
      "\u201cMany states came into this administration with a track record of trying to privatize education, and I think they see this move to dismantle and defund the Department of Ed and President Trump\u2019s support of school privatization as a green light to be more expansive in their approach moving forward,\u201d said Hilary Wething, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute who closely studies the impact of voucher programs on public education.",
      "Just last week, Texas enacted a statewide private school voucher program, becoming the 16th state to offer some form of a universal school choice program. In private school voucher programs, families can receive a certain amount of public money to use toward private K-12 school tuition or school supplies. In some states, such programs have previously come with limitations, including narrow eligibility, such as private schools that can accommodate families with children who have special needs or families that are below certain income levels.",
      "Proponents of the program in Texas and others like it dub it a \u201cuniversal voucher\u201d program because it has no restrictions on who is eligible. Under the program, any family in the state may receive about $10,000 to pay for their children\u2019s K-12 private school education. Texas\u2019 program will launch in the 2026-27 school year.",
      "Statewide voucher programs are far from a new phenomenon. But they have exploded in recent years amid a growing political effort by conservatives at the local, state and federal levels to boost \u201cschool choice\u201d \u2014 the notion that parents should have far more options than only their neighborhood public schools.",
      "Sixteen states offer at least one voucher program that has universal eligibility, while another 14 offer voucher programs with eligibility requirements, according to the Education Law Center, a public education advocacy group that is critical of voucher programs.",
      "At least three states, Texas, Idaho and Tennessee, have enacted their universal programs this year, while in another eight states, attempts by conservative lawmakers to create new voucher programs or expand existing ones stalled or failed, according to the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union.",
      "\u201cEven though this is not a new explosion of voucher laws, this year continues the explosion of vouchers \u2026 and even though the USDOE [dismantling] isn\u2019t necessarily the one driving force, it\u2019s definitely connected,\u201d said Jessica Levin, the litigation director at the Education Law Center, which is assisting with lawsuits challenging Trump\u2019s moves to dismantle the Department of Education. \u201cThe bottom line is that this is a concerted strategy on the part of those who want to defund and dismantle public schools and privatize public education.\u201d",
      "The most prominent argument made by critics of voucher programs is that they take public money that would have otherwise been allocated to help fund public schools and deliver it to private schools.",
      "Private schools, they note, do not face most of the accountability requirements that public schools do under federal laws. For example, private schools retain the ability to refuse admission to students, are not required to provide individualized education plans to children with learning disabilities and are not required under law to provide disabled students or students facing disciplinary measures certain protections or due process rights.",
      "At the same time, funding formulas for public schools are predominantly based on enrollment numbers. So, as students flee public schools \u2014 even if in just small numbers \u2014 overall funding decreases.",
      "\u201cThe students who remain in public schools lose resources,\u201d Levin said, while \u201cvoucher students lose rights.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Levin explained, voucher-driven pupil departures from public school means \u201cyou\u2019re now concentrating higher-need, higher-cost kids in public schools that now have less funding.\u201d",
      "Those situations are now compounded by Trump\u2019s moves to wind down the Education Department, which experts have said will further upend civil rights enforcement in schools as well as the distribution of billions of dollars to help impoverished and disabled students.",
      "U.S. Department of Education spokesperson Savannah Newhouse said in an email to NBC News that \u201cPresident Trump and Secretary [Linda] McMahon believe that our nation\u2019s students will thrive when parents are given the freedom to choose a school setting that best fits their child\u2019s academic needs.\u201d",
      "Newhouse added that the administration \u201cwill provide states with best practices on how they can expand educational opportunities and empower local leaders to implement customized policy that will benefit their communities the most.\u201d",
      "While some states have had voucher-like programs allowing families to use public money for parochial education dating back more than 100 years, modern voucher programs have been around for about 30 years, having launched in large part in the 1990s amid a grassroots conservative movement to increase options for parents unhappy with their local public schools.",
      "But the Covid-19 pandemic emerged as a flashpoint for conservative education activists, who utilized widespread anger among parents unhappy with school closings and remote learning as a launchpad for new and expanded voucher programs across the nation.",
      "School voucher proponents say the programs maximize choice for parents, who can use the funds to subsidize the cost of expensive private schools, which, they argue, deliver better outcomes for students. Supporters have also touted the programs as offering a market-based approach that helps promote the best schools and have argued that they have the potential to benefit low-income families or families with uniquely few options for public school.",
      "Tommy Schultz, the CEO of the American Federation for Children, a conservative group that advocates for school voucher programs, told Fox News this week that universal voucher programs like the one enacted in Texas give parents \u201ceducation freedom.\u201d",
      "He praised a similar program that Florida expanded in 2023, claiming it had caused the state\u2019s public schools to \u201chave gotten better.\u201d Schultz denied that Texas\u2019 program, or ones like it,\u00a0would result in fewer resources for public schools, calling that \u201cthe same argument for 30 years\u201d by public education advocates.",
      "Andrew Mahaleris, a spokesperson for Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, said in an email that the Republican \u201cmade education freedom a priority because no one knows the needs of their child better than a parent.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to education, parents matter, and families deserve the ability to choose the best education opportunities for their children,\u201d Mahaleris added. \u201cThe Governor signing school choice into law is an unprecedented victory for Texas families, students, and the future of our great state.\u201d",
      "But critics point to examples showing that universal school voucher programs are disproportionately used by wealthy families whose children are already enrolled in private schools, or that children in rural areas with few schools have limited options to put the money to use. They also point to studies that refute the claim that private schools deliver better outcomes for students.",
      "In addition, enrollment in private schools, even with a voucher to help cover the cost, can still be prohibitively expensive for low-income families, they said.",
      "Wething, of the EPI, said analyses have shown that between 60% and 90% of students who take advantage of universal-eligibility voucher programs across the U.S. were already enrolled in private school when they participated in the programs.",
      "She warned of the harms she said programs like the one in Texas posed.",
      "\u201cAs soon as you get rid of income limits or carveouts for, say, only low-income families or only students with disabilities, you basically open the gates for students who are already attending private school, or who already have enough income to attend private school, to now use state funding to subsidize their private school,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s kind of the next step in what we think of as this voucher evolution.\u201d"

      "A Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 on a failed mission to Venus is believed to have crashed back onto Earth early on Saturday morning.",
      "The European Space Agency, which was monitoring the craft's uncontrolled descent, said it was last spotted by radar over Germany. At at the time of its expected crash, radars could no longer detect the Kosmos 482, concluding that \u201cit is most likely that the reentry has already occurred.\u201d",
      "No injuries or damage have been reported.",
      "The Kosmos 482 spacecraft was part of the U.S.S.R's Venera program, a series of probes that were developed to research the planet Venus. Ten of those missions successfully landed on the hot, barren planet, but the rocket carrying Kosmos 482 malfunctioned. Its upper stage, which contained the descent craft, got stuck in Earth orbit.",
      "Over the following fifty-three years, the approximately three-foot wide, 1,069 pound spacecraft circled the Earth in an ever-smaller elliptical orbit, until it came close enough to fall into the planet's atmosphere.",
      "It's not unusual for space junk to fall back to earth. More than 2,400 human-made objects fell from space in 2022, a record number, according to ESA. The vast majority of them burned up in Earth's atmosphere, and most of those that didn't splashed into an ocean.",
      "But Kosmos 482 was built to withstand a descent through Venus' dense atmosphere, and to operate on the planet's surface, where the mean temperature is 867 degrees Fahrenheit (464 C). That meant it was theoretically hardy enough to survive a comparatively easy re-entry through Earth's atmosphere.",
      "There\u2019s no record of space debris ever causing a human fatality. \u201cThe risk of any satellite reentry causing injury is extremely remote,\u201d ESA officials wrote in a\u00a0blog post about Kosmos-482. \u201cThe annual risk of an individual human being injured by space debris is under 1 in 100 billion. In comparison, a person is about 65,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the U.S. Space Force forecasted that the spacecraft would re-enter the atmosphere at 1:52 a.m. ET on Saturday morning above the Pacific Ocean, west of Guam."

    "story": [
      "MOSCOW \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy broke with long-standing protocol by not employing his own interpreter during three high-level meetings with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, opting instead to rely on translators from the Kremlin, a U.S.\u00a0official and two Western officials with knowledge of the talks told NBC News.",
      "Steve Witkoff, who has been tasked with negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, met with Putin in Moscow for several hours on Feb. 11, on March 13, and in St. Petersburg on April 11, and \u201cused their translators,\u201d one of the Western officials said. \u201cIf they speak to each other in Russian, he doesn\u2019t know what they are saying,\u201d the official added, referring to Putin and the interpreters.",
      "Witkoff, a former real estate mogul and cryptocurrency trader, does not speak Russian. By using Kremlin interpreters, he ran the risk that some of the nuance in Putin\u2019s messages was missed and he would not have been able to independently verify what was being said to him, two former American ambassadors said.",
      "Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement that Witkoff \u201cabides by all security protocols in coordination with the State Department.\u201d  Witkoff\u2019s team did not respond. Both the State Department and the Kremlin have also been asked for comment.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have been killed since Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump campaigned on ending the war on \u201cday one\u201d and has made it one of his top priorities. Putin, meanwhile, has shown little interest in ending the conflict, and in remarks broadcast Sunday, referenced Russia\u2019s nuclear capability as he talked about bringing the war to an end.",
      "The Russian leader, who is known to speak some English, communicates through an interpreter during negotiations and when he is conducting official meetings. At a meeting with Witkoff on April 25, he was flanked by his special adviser Yuri Ushakov, who served as Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States between 1998 and 2008, and Kirill Dmitriev, his special envoy for investment and economic cooperation. An interpreter joined Putin\u2019s team.",
      "A short video of the meeting released by the Kremlin shows a smiling Witkoff entering the room alone before he shakes hands with Putin, who is also broadly beaming. Witkoff does not appear to be accompanied by any advisers or experts who typically support American officials conducting delicate and complicated negotiations.",
      "As a woman joined Witkoff on his side of the table, he pointed at her and\u00a0said, \u201cInterpreter? From the embassy? OK.\u201d",
      "Kelly, the White House deputy press secretary and Witkoff\u2019s team did not identify the woman when asked by NBC News. The State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the Kremlin have also been asked for comment.",
      "Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said using the Kremlin\u2019s interpreter was \u201ca very bad idea\u201d that put Witkoff \u201cat a real disadvantage.\u201d",
      "\u201cI speak Russian and have listened to Kremlin interpreters and U.S. interpreters at the same meeting, and the language is never the same,\u201d McFaul said via email Wednesday.",
      "Having a U.S. interpreter present also ensures a more accurate written account of the meeting for the rest of the government, known as a memorandum of conversation or \u201cmemcon,\u201d said McFaul, now professor of political science at Stanford University.",
      "\u201cAt the end of every meeting that I attended, I debriefed the interpreter to make sure we heard everything correctly, to get the \u2018memcom\u2019 exactly right. You can\u2019t do that using a Russian official,\u201d he added.",
      "Not having detailed notes about the meetings could create problems for other senior members of the Trump administration, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, as they try to advance discussions, McFaul said.",
      "\u201cHow does Kellogg know what Witkoff agreed to with Putin? He only knows it through a \u2018memcom,\u2019\u201d he added.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s dealings with sensitive information as he plays a key role in trying to resolve not only the war in Ukraine, but also the conflict in Gaza and the nuclear deal with Iran, have also raised eyebrows.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s plane, which he uses to fly to Russia for the meetings, is not fitted with a secure government communications system, according to two Western officials, including one previously quoted in this article. However, the officials said he has made sensitive calls from the U.S. Embassy before boarding the plane and has a secure cellphone.",
      "NBC News approached the White House National Security Council for comment and was referred to Witkoff\u2019s team, which did not respond. The State Department has also been asked for comment.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s efforts appear to have yielded little results in ending the war, at least from Russia\u2019s side.",
      "A proposal that Trump should meet with Putin on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week was nixed because there was no movement on Russia\u2019s part toward a ceasefire, according to two administration officials and one U.S. official familiar with the planning. A meeting would have been contingent on Russia agreeing to a ceasefire in Ukraine, the administration officials said.",
      "Separately, a European official said intelligence assessments indicate Putin remains committed to maximalist goals in the war in Ukraine and has no interest in coming to a negotiated settlement.",
      "Putin has previously said he wants Ukraine to withdraw from four regions \u2014 Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 which Russia illegally annexed shortly after invading Ukraine in February 2022. He has also insisted that Ukraine promise never to join NATO, accept restrictions on the size of its army, and protect Russian culture and language inside the country.",
      "Since his last meeting with Witkoff, the White House has signed an \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d with Ukraine that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn nation\u2019s critical minerals and natural resources.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians have been cooperative, flexible, supportive and eager to move forward, but the Russians have not,\u201d said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and now a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, adding that it was \u201cstandard, basic practice that you have your own interpreter,\u201d in high-level diplomatic meetings.",
      "Ukraine, he said, had agreed to U.S. proposals on a comprehensive air, sea and land ceasefire, while extending a truce to Black Sea shipping lanes.",
      "A \u201cterm sheet\u201d with 22 proposals, including a 30-day ceasefire, has been drawn up by American, European and Ukrainian negotiators, one of the Western officials said, adding that it met Putin\u2019s demand that the U.S. will not support Ukraine joining NATO.",
      "\u201cIf Putin wants a way out, here is his way out,\u201d the official said of the proposals. Witkoff will have to present them to the Russian president, they added.",
      "In remarks published Sunday, Putin said Russia had sufficient strength and resources to take the war in Ukraine to its logical conclusion, though he hoped there would be no need to use nuclear weapons.",
      "In a film broadcast by state television titled \u201cRussia, Kremlin, Putin, 25 years,\u201d he said, \u201cThere has been no need to use those weapons ... and I hope they will not be required.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the eyes of many LGBTQ Catholics, the late Pope Francis created a \u201cseismic shift\u201d toward acceptance. Now, as the world welcomes the newly elected Pope Leo XIV, these lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer faithful say they hope he will continue to move in the same direction.",
      "Marianne Duddy-Burke, executive director of the LGBTQ Catholic advocacy group DignityUSA, was in Rome on Thursday when Cardinal Robert Prevost, a 69-year-old Chicago native who holds both U.S. and Peruvian citizenship, became the new pontiff.",
      "\u201cI was actually quite excited to see that Cardinal Prevost had been elected as Pope Leo XIV and thrilled that he took the name of a pope rooted in social justice. I think what a clear signal to a hurting world that that\u2019s where his energy is going to be focused,\u201d she told NBC News in an interview Friday. \u201cI also found a lot of hope in his remarks from the balcony \u2026 where he talked about God\u2019s all-inclusive love without any condition, and where he talked about being a church for all of God\u2019s people.\u201d",
      "Jason Steidl Jack, a gay Catholic and an assistant teaching professor of religious studies at St. Joseph\u2019s University, New York, described his reaction to the election of Pope Leo, the first-ever American to lead the Holy See, as \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do see him continuing Pope Francis\u2019 legacy, especially of dialogue and synodality,\u201d Steidl Jack said, describing synodality as \u201cthis idea of journeying together\u201d and \u201clistening to one another.\u201d However, he said the new pope\u2019s election \u201cdoesn\u2019t assuage all of the fears that I have as an LGBTQ Catholic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe church\u2019s teaching, even under Pope Francis, remains incredibly homophobic, and the church goes on inventing new ways of being transphobic as it really avoids learning about trans people and their experiences,\u201d he said, adding, however, that the new pontiff seems \u201copen to dialogue and inclusion\u201d given his remarks on Thursday.",
      "Chicago resident Greg Krajewski said he\u2019s been a practicing Catholic his whole life and sings at his local parish every Sunday. However, he said, as a gay man, he\u2019s \u201ccareful who I talk to and how I present myself.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a few things in his opening speech that he gave that really give me a lot of hope,\u201d he said of Leo. \u201cThe first thing is he said a couple of times, \u2018God loves us without limits or conditions.\u2019 I think this is a really big indication that even if he himself maybe has more reservations about the LGBTQ issues in the church, he is open to those discussions. He is open to bringing us in.\u201d",
      "Track record on LGBTQ issues",
      "Leo\u2019s past comments on LGBTQ issues are limited, though several LGBTQ Catholics expressed concern about remarks he reportedly made in an address to church leaders over a decade ago. During the 2012 Synod of Bishops, then-Father Prevost reportedly lamented the challenges presented to the Catholic Church due to sympathetic media portrayals of \u201calternative families.\u201d",
      "\u201cNote, for example, how alternative families comprised of homosexual partners and their adopted children are so benignly and sympathetically portrayed on television programs and in cinema,\u201d he told\u00a0a group of bishops at the time, according to the Catholic News Service. \u201cThe sympathy for anti-Christian lifestyle choices that the mass media fosters is so brilliantly and artfully engrained in the viewing public that when people hear the Christian message, it often inevitably seems ideological and emotionally cruel by contrast to the ostensible humaneness of the anti-Christian perspective.\u201d",
      "Francis DeBernardo, the executive director of New Ways Ministry, which works to foster LGBTQ inclusion in the Catholic Church, called the remarks \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe pray that in the 13 years that have passed, 12 of which were under the papacy of Pope Francis, that his heart and mind have developed more progressively on LGBTQ+ issues, and we will take a wait-and-see attitude to see if that has happened,\u201d DeBernardo said in a statement.",
      "Steidl Jack said Leo seemed to have a \u201cculture warrior mentality\u201d on same-sex marriage and LGBTQ representation in pop culture back in 2012, but he expressed hope that the new pope\u2019s views have changed since then.",
      "\u201cA lot of the world has changed since 2012 \u2014 even Pope Francis changed a great deal over the course of his pontificate,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I hope that Pope Leo has been listening to LGBTQ Catholics. I hope he\u2019s been paying attention and growing, just as Pope Francis did, just as the rest of the world has been.\u201d",
      "Views on LGBTQ issues have shifted dramatically over the past decade, including the views of practicing Catholics. For example, the Pew Research Center\u2019s 2023-24 Religious Landscape Study, which found 19% of U.S. adults identify as Catholics, found 70% of Catholics favor allowing same-sex couples to marry, up from 57% in 2014.",
      "Michael O\u2019Loughlin, the executive director of Outreach, an LGBTQ Catholic organization, was in Rome for the announcement of the new pope. He said the 2012 comments were disappointing but that he was keeping an open mind.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m willing to look at his wider message, which was one of peace and standing up for the marginalized,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that he switched to Spanish to address his former community in Peru I thought was a nice sign that he\u2019s a man of the people.\u201d",
      "After 2012, the future pope\u2019s subsequent remarks on LGBTQ issues are sparse.",
      "In 2017, when he was bishop of Chiclayo, Peru, and spokesman of the Peruvian Episcopal Conference, he appeared to speak out against \u201cgender ideology,\u201d a term some people use to refer to transgender identities, telling local media that this ideology \u201cseeks to eliminate biological differences between men and women.\u201d",
      "Then, in 2024, a year after Pope Francis formally approved allowing Catholic priests to bless same-sex couples, then-Cardinal Prevost said the subsequent pushback from bishops in Africa highlighted the need to give more doctrinal authority to local bishops, according to CBCPNews, the news service of the Catholic Bishops\u2019 Conference of the Philippines.",
      "\u201cThe bishops in the episcopal conferences of Africa were basically saying that here in Africa, our whole cultural reality is very different. \u2026 It wasn\u2019t rejecting the teaching authority of Rome, it was saying that our cultural situation is such that the application of this document is just not going to work,\u201d Prevost said at the time, according to CBCPNews. \u201cYou have to remember there are still places in Africa that apply the death penalty, for example, for people who are living in a homosexual relationship. \u2026 So, we\u2019re in very different worlds.\u201d",
      "Hopes for the future",
      "When asked what she\u2019d like to see from Leo\u2019s papacy, Duddy-Burke said she hopes he can serve a \u201ctrusted moral voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe world is so broken at the moment in so many places \u2014\u00a0you know, this rise of nationalism, the increased xenophobia, so many wars that are very vicious happening around the world \u2014 I just hope that he can become a very clear and trusted moral voice in the world, and some of that means dealing with the inequities and failings within our own church as well,\u201d she said.",
      "Steidl Jack said he hopes Leo listens to Catholics with differing viewpoints.",
      "\u201cOne of the gifts of Pope Francis\u2019 papacy was that he encouraged church leaders to go outside of the church, to listen to people outside of the hierarchy, and that\u2019s really what Pope Leo needs to do, especially regarding same-sex relationships and transgender experience,\u201d he said.",
      "DeBernardo, of New Ways Ministry, said in his statement that he hopes Leo continues to build upon the foundation that Francis laid out.",
      "\u201cPope Francis opened the door to a new approach to LGBTQ+ people,\u201d he said. \u201cPope Leo must now guide the church through that door.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "NEW YORK  \u2014 Federal agents investigating New York City Mayor Eric Adams were still seizing phones and applying for search warrants days before Justice Department leaders ordered prosecutors to drop the corruption case, according to documents released Friday.",
      "The trove of court records, which had been sealed, opens a window into the criminal case and shows that even as Washington officials were backing away from the prosecution, investigators in Manhattan were moving forward.",
      "The documents also confirm something prosecutors revealed previously: That a federal investigation into whether Adams took improper campaign contributions began in August of 2021, when the Democrat was still in his old job of Brooklyn borough president but was widely expected to win the mayor\u2019s race that fall.",
      "Adams has repeatedly said he believed he was prosecuted because, much later, as mayor, he criticized former President Joe Biden\u2019s immigration policies.",
      "The investigation first\u00a0spilled into public view\u00a0in November 2023, when FBI agents seized Adams\u2019 phones and iPad as he was leaving an event in Manhattan. He was\u00a0charged\u00a010 months later with accepting free travel and illegal campaign contributions from people seeking to buy his influence, including a Turkish diplomat.",
      "But on Feb. 10, weeks after President Donald Trump took office, the new leadership of the Justice Department\u00a0ordered federal prosecutors in New York to drop the charges, arguing the case was hindering the mayor\u2019s ability to assist in the Republican administration\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "The extraordinary directive roiled federal prosecutors\u2019 offices in Manhattan and Washington. Rather than implement the order, multiple prosecutors resigned, including the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan,\u00a0Danielle Sassoon. A judge ultimately said he legally had no choice but to dismiss the case at the request of senior Justice Department officials.",
      "Prosecutors were continuing to dig into Adams in the weeks before the case got halted, and Sassoon has said they were on the verge of bringing additional charges against him for obstruction of justice.",
      "On Feb. 7 a judge had signed off on an application to search a phone that an unidentified subject of the investigation had turned over in response to a subpoena. Weeks earlier, a judge had signed a warrant to search a home in Middletown, New York, in connection with a probe of alleged straw donations made to Adams\u2019 campaign in 2020. Around the same time, prosecutors requested a warrant to access location data for a mobile phone in that investigation. On Dec. 4, a judge had approved a request by federal investigators to search a home in Queens.",
      "U.S. District Judge Dale E. Ho ordered the records unsealed at the request of The New York Times and, later, the New York Post. The Times argued in court papers that there was a \u201cparticularly compelling\u201d case for making them public because there would be no trial. Neither Adams\u2019 lawyers, nor prosecutors opposed the request.",
      "The documents offer a behind-the-scenes look at how investigators pieced their case together through searches of electronics and physical locations around New York and beyond.",
      "The unsealed documents also revealed that in May 2024, a magistrate judge signed off on a warrant to search the Fort Lee, New Jersey, condominium home of the mayor\u2019s longtime romantic partner, Tracey Collins, who formerly served as a senior official in the city\u2019s Department of Education.",
      "The warrant application does not name Collins directly but identifies her as Adams\u2019 partner and says the mayor also sometimes uses the home. Agents wanted to do the search to get access to five iPhones as they looked into whether an official connected to the Turkish consulate sought help getting a child admitted to a highly sought-after public middle school.",
      "Also included was the September 2024 application for a warrant to search Gracie Mansion, the mayor\u2019s official residence in Manhattan, providing photos of the building from multiple angles.",
      "An affidavit from an FBI agent notes that location data for one of Adams\u2019 phones suggests he spends the \u201covernight hours\u201d of Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday at the residence \u201cand occasionally does so on other days as well.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the new documents, Adams\u2019 lawyer, Alex Spiro, criticized the now-ended prosecution.",
      "\u201cThis case \u2014 the first of its kind airline upgrade \u2018corruption\u2019 case \u2014 should never have been brought in the first place and is now over,\u201d Spiro, said.",
      "Adams has touted the dismissal of the case as a vindication, while denying that he cut a deal with Trump in exchange for leniency. But he has maintained a warm relationship with the president after his case was dismissed. The two leaders met in Washington on Friday, with Trump later telling reporters that \u201cI think he actually came in to thank me.\u201d",
      "Adams\u2019 office released a statement that said they discussed \u201ccritical infrastructure projects, as well as the preservation of essential social services, among other topics.\u201d",
      "Even with the criminal charges behind him, Adams faces an uncertain political future. He recently\u00a0announced\u00a0that he would skip the Democratic primary in June and instead run as an independent in the November general election."

      "A federal judge in California on Friday temporarily blocked plans for reductions-in-force and reorganization at 21 departments and agencies across the federal government, a significant setback as the Trump administration works to downsize.",
      "\u201cThe President has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch,\u201d Judge Susan Illston wrote in her order after hearing arguments on the issue earlier in the day.",
      "\u201cMany presidents have sought this cooperation before; many iterations of Congress have provided it. Nothing prevents the President from requesting this cooperation\u2014as he did in his prior term of office. Indeed, the Court holds the President likely must request Congressional cooperation to order the changes he seeks, and thus issues a temporary restraining order to pause large-scale reductions in force in the meantime,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The temporary restraining order, in effect for two weeks, puts the president\u2019s \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201d Workforce Optimization Initiative on hold for 21 departments and agencies. The order also includes memos issued to the same effect by the Office of Personnel Management and DOGE.",
      "Illston, appointed by President Bill Clinton, said she believes there\u2019s no statute that gives the Office of Personnel Management, the Office of Management and Budget, or DOGE the authority to direct other federal agencies to engage in large-scale terminations, restructuring, or elimination of itself. \u201cSuch action is far outside the bounds of any authority that Congress vested in OPM or OMB, and, as noted, DOGE has no statutory authority whatsoever,\u201d she wrote.",
      "While thousands of federal employees working in departments and agencies across the country have been RIF\u2019ed since Trump took office in January, the Trump administration has not made an exact number of affected employees available.",
      "The departments and agencies blocked from instituting reductions-in-force or reorganizations include DOGE, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Interior and Transportation.",
      "The Trump administration argued the lawsuit, filed April 28, lacked timeliness because the Executive Order was issued nearly three months ago. In similar cases around the country, the administration has argued lawsuits filed immediately after Executive Orders were issued are premature. \u201cDefendants cannot have it both ways,\" Judge Illston wrote. \u201cThe Court finds that plaintiffs reasonably waited to gather what information they could about the harm they may suffer from the Executive Order, the OMB/OPM Memorandum, and the ARRPs (Agency RIF and Reorganization Plans).\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration\u2019s unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation,\u201d the coalition of non-profits, unions, and local governments said in a statement Friday.",
      "\u201cEach of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government \u2014 laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that. We are gratified by the court\u2019s decision today to pause these harmful actions while our case proceeds.\u201d",
      "Illston is scheduled to hear further arguments in this case on May 22.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment."

      "\u201cWhat\u2019s happening in South Africa fits the textbook definition of why the refugee program was created,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThis is race-based persecution. The refugee program is not intended as a solution for global poverty, and historically, it has been used that way.\u201d",

The pair, bonded by an intense emotional connection and teenage promises, must confront a truth: love alone isn\u2019t always enough to anchor two people amid dreams, expectations and self-discovery.",
      "By Episode 8, the cracks are no longer subtle. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to fight for us, then fight for Justin,\u201d Keisha pleads. It\u2019s a turning point. She urges him to stop orbiting their relationship and start choosing himself. Justin listens \u2014 and walks away. Their parting is soft, tearful and filled with affection.

      "In Episode 7, Keisha\u2019s father warns her that Justin is still lost, not out of judgment, but recognition. He, too, once wandered without direction. Justin\u2019s internal struggle, college versus music, becomes a metaphor for the fork in the road every young adult faces.",
      "By the final episode, Keisha and Justin take a break. Then they reunite, reaffirm their love and break up again, this time for good. Not in anger. Not in bitterness. But out of necessity.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t leave because he stops loving her,\u201d Cooper says. \u201cHe leaves because he needs to know who he is. And that\u2019s what hurts the most.\u201d",

      "\u201cAnything that goes and takes away from you,\u201d Keisha\u2019s mother tells her, \u201che will replace it with the same or better.\u201d It reframes their breakup not as a loss, but as a necessary chapter.",
      "Despite its title, \"Forever\" doesn\u2019t glorify permanence. Instead, it frames love as a rite of passage \u2014 something that shapes us, challenges us and sometimes leaves us.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re that age, everything feels intense,\u201d Simone says. \u201cEvery choice feels like the most important decision of your life.\u201d",
      "\u201cTheir relationship felt high-stakes, like the world would end if it didn\u2019t work out. But that\u2019s just part of growing up,\u201d Cooper says.",
      "That\u2019s why the ending lingers \u2014 not because it\u2019s sad, but because it\u2019s honest. \"Forever\" doesn\u2019t claim love always lasts. It shows how even the right love, if it ends, can leave you better than it found you."

      "Taylor Swift\u2019s spokesperson is speaking out after the pop star was reportedly subpoenaed in Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni\u2019s \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d legal case.",
      "According to Swift\u2019s rep, the singer has no connection to the film other than the use of her song \u201cMy Tears Richochet\u201d for the soundtrack, adding that the subpoena was issued in an attempt to use Swift to create \u201ctabloid clickbait\u201d instead of focusing on the case.",
      "\u201cTaylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, she did not score the film, she never saw an edit or made any notes on the film, she did not even see \u2018It Ends With Us\u2019 until weeks after its public release, and was traveling around the globe during 2023 and 2024 headlining the biggest tour in history,\u201d the statement reads.",
      "\u201cThe connection Taylor had to this film was permitting the use of one song, \u2018My Tears Ricochet,\u2019\u201d the statement continues.\u00a0\u201cGiven that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift\u2019s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case.\u201d",
      "Freedman and Lively's attorneys did not immediately respond in NBC News and TODAY.com's request for comment.",
      "Baldoni and Blake are scheduled to go on trial in March 2026.",
      "After the release of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d in August, Lively filed a sexual harassment complaint against Baldoni, claiming that on multiple occasions he crossed the line on set during intimate scenes and harrassd her on set, according to an administrative complaint\u00a0filed Dec. 20, 2024 and obtained by TODAY.com.",
      "Weeks later, Lively then filed a\u00a0lawsuit against Baldoni, his production company Wayfarer Studios, producer Jamey Heath, Baldoni\u2019s publicist Jennifer Abel, crisis publicist Melissa Nathan and others connected to the director and the film, arguing that she had been a victim of a smear campaign and sexual harassment, per NBC News-obtained court documents.",
      "Baldoni's attorney denied the allegations at the time, and in response, in January 2025, he sued Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds publicist Leslie Sloane and her PR firm of\u00a0defamation\u00a0and\u00a0other contractual claims.",
      "Lively's team, in a statement to NBC News at the time, denied the allegations.",
      "Swift\u2019s name came into play after Baldoni and his team created a website\u00a0about the lawsuit against Lively, which includes their complaint as well as alleged emails and texts from people who worked on \u201cIt Ends With Us.\u201d",
      "One email claims that Lively would \u201cchange her mind\u201d about calling Swift to use \u201cMy Tears Ricochet\u201d for the trailer \u201cif her demands are not met.\u201d",
      "Lively's reps did not respond to TODAY.com's request for comment on the launch of the website and its content at the time.",
      "In February, Lively filed an amended complaint against Baldoni, claiming she \"was not alone in raising allegations of on-set misconduct,\" according to the complaint obtained by NBC News. At the time, Baldoni's attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

    "story": [
      "A new Netflix documentary, \u201cA Deadly American Marriage,\u201d explores the case of Molly Martens, who was charged along with her father with the 2015 murder of her husband, Jason Corbett.",
      "Martens and her dad, Tom Martens, were charged and convicted of second-degree murder, a conviction later downgraded to voluntary manslaughter, after Corbett was found with severe head trauma at the couple\u2019s home in Davidson County, North Carolina.",
      "Molly Martens has said that the killing was an act of self-defense, and that Corbett was emotionally and physically abusive during their marriage.",
      "Meanwhile, Corbett\u2019s relatives have disputed this and have alleged that Corbett\u2019s killing was an act of calculated murder on the part of Martens and her father.",
      "The Netflix documentary explores the case from both perspectives, including sharing the viewpoints of Corbett\u2019s now-grown children, Jack and Sarah Corbett, who have defended their father against Martens\u2019 claims.",
      "Molly Martens, now released from prison, was also interviewed extensively for the documentary, and she shared where her relationship stands now with her former stepchildren. Her stepchildren also spoke out in the documentary with daughter Sarah saying her father was a \u201cvictim.\u201d",
      "Keep reading to learn more about Molly Martens and where she is now.",
      "Who is Molly Martens?",
      "Molly Martens is the second wife of Jason Corbett.",
      "Corbett hired Martens as an au pair after his first wife, Margaret, died of an asthma attack in the early 2000s. After \u201cseveral weeks\u201d living together, they began a romantic relationship, according to a 2020 document from the Court of Appeals of North Carolina concluding that the Martens warranted a retrial.",
      "In 2011, they moved from Ireland, where Corbett and his first wife were from, to Davidson County, South Carolina, near Molly Marten's home state of Tennessee, then married.",
      "Why did Molly Martens go to prison?",
      "Molly Martens and her father, Tom Martens, were found guilty of second-degree murder in August 2017 for the killing of Corbett. They were both sentenced to between 20 and 25 years in prison.",
      "On the night of Corbett\u2019s killing, Tom Martens beat Corbett with a baseball bat at the couple\u2019s home, allegedly after discovering Corbett choking his daughter, according to Tom Martens\u2019 court testimony included in a 2020 document from the Court of Appeals of North Carolina.",
      "Molly Martens also hit Corbett with a paving brick, according to her testimony included in the appeals document.",
      "Corbett died from blunt force head trauma and \u201cextensive skull fractures,\u201d according to his autopsy, which was cited in the 2020 Court of Appeals document.",
      "Molly and Tom Martens have never denied that their actions that night led to Corbett\u2019s death, but they have both argued that they were carried out in self-defense, and defense of each other.",
      "In 2021, the father and daughter were granted a retrial after they appealed the court\u2019s original ruling, arguing that statements from Corbett\u2019s children should have been considered in the original trial.",
      "The trial court found that Jcak and Sarah\u2019s testimonies \u201cwere not made at a time when (they) were motivated to speak the truth but were rather motivated to affect future custody arrangements,\u201d per the 2020 document from the Court of Appeals.",
      "Jack and Sarah said during a medical evaluation at a children\u2019s advocacy center in Mocksville, North Carolina they had witnessed their father get angry at Molly Martens. Jack specifically said his father had \u201cpunched, hit, and pushed\u201d her, and that Corbett\u2019s anger problems had \u201cgotten worse.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe children appear to have known that if they were not in the custody of defendant Molly Corbett they would be taken to live in the Republic of Ireland with relatives of their father,\u201d the Court of Appeals document cites the trial court as stating.",
      "Both Jack and Sarah later recanted their statements, both saying that Molly Martens had coached them on what to say during their interviews. Jack said during a 2017 Skype call with a Davidson County district attorney that Molly Martens had made up stories about Corbett being abusive \u201cstarted saying if you don\u2019t lie (she would) never see (us) again.\u201d",
      "Both defendants struck plea deals before a retrial could take place. Molly Martens pleaded no contest to a downgraded charge of second-degree manslaughter, while her father pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "Both Tom and Molly Martens received credit for time already served, and were both released from prison on June 6, 2024.",
      "Where is Molly Martens now?",
      "Molly Martens was released from prison in Raleigh, North Carolina, on June 6, 2024, according to her inmate record from the North Carolina Correctional Institute for Women.",
      "She is currently on parole, with a parole end date set for June 6, 2025, according to her inmate record.",
      "Released from prison in June 2024, both Molly and Tom Martens were required to remain in Tennessee throughout their one-year parole, Brad Deen, a communications officer at the North Carolina Department of Adult Correction, told the Irish newspaper The Times last year.",
      "Under the terms of their post-release supervision, the father and daughter have not been allowed to live together, but may visit each other, Deen told The Times. He also said they are both allowed to travel around the United States but must notify authorities of their movements.",
      "According to an email from Deen to TODAY.com, Molly and Thomas Martens will complete their post-release supervision on June 6, 2025.",
      "Martens\u2019 brother, Connor Martens, shared an update about how his sister and dad are doing in a May 7 interview with NBC affiliate WBIR Channel 10 in Knoxville, Tennessee.",
      "Tom Martens, he said, is \u201cdoing really well\u201d and is \u201cjust so grateful for all the small things in life,\u201d such as spending time with his wife and grandkids.",
      "\u201cMolly definitely has elements of that but it\u2019s harder for her,\u201d he continued.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s in kind of the thick of her life and she\u2019s not retired, and there\u2019s been a lot more media scrutiny and harassment and she struggles a little bit more with the trauma, but overall I think she\u2019s really grateful and she\u2019s doing really well, all things considered.\"",

      "Brinkley, who was married to French illustrator Jean Francois Allaux prior to meeting Joel, went on to marry and divorce twice again after her and Joel's divorce, and welcomed Jack and Sailor with her ex\u00a0Peter Cook.",
      "Joel, who married and divorced his first wife, Elizabeth Webber, in the 1970s, also walked down the aisle two more times after his divorce from Brinkley.",
      "The Grammy winner was married to author Katie Lee from 2004 to 2009 before tying the knot with his fourth wife Alexis Roderick, in 2015. Joel and Roderick share two young daughters, Della Rose, 9, and Remy Anne, 7."

      "Jason Corbett, who was Irish, lived with his first wife, Margaret \u201cMags\u201d Fitzpatrick, in Ireland, and they had two children, Jack and Sarah.",
      "After Fitzpatrick\u00a0died unexpectedly of an asthma attack in the early 2000s, Corbett hired Molly Martens to work as an au pair. Romance bloomed between them and in 2011, they married and moved with Jack and Sarah to Davidson County, North Carolina.",
      "In 2015, a fateful altercation occurred between Corbett, Martens, and Martens\u2019 father, Tom Martens, a retired FBI agent.",
      "Tom Martens and his wife, Sharon, were staying with their daughter and husband at their home in Davidson County, visiting from Tennessee. One night in August 2015, Tom Martens said he heard a commotion coming from the couple\u2019s bedroom, including \u201ca scream and loud voices,\u201d according to his court testimony, included in a 2020 document from the Court of Appeals of North Carolina.",
      "Tom Martens said he went to the couple\u2019s room with an aluminum baseball bat and discovered Corbett with his hands around Molly Martens\u2019 neck. Corbett then reportedly moved his wife into a chokehold using his right arm, according to Tom Martens\u2019 testimony per the Court of Appeals document.",
      "A fight ensued, and Tom Martens hit Corbett on the head with the bat, attempting to free his daughter. As the two men struggled for control of the bat, Molly Martens grabbed a paving brick from her nightstand and used it to hit her husband, according to Molly Martens\u2019s testimony included in the Court of Appeals document.",
      "Tom Martens regained control of the bat and continued to strike Corbett \u201cuntil he was down, and he felt certain that Jason \u2018could not kill them,\u2019\u201d according to his testimony.",
      "Tom Martens then called 911 and told the dispatcher that Corbett was \u201cin bad shape\u201d and \u201cbleeding all over\u201d and said, \u201cI may have killed him.\u201d",
      "Sergeant Barry Alphin, a paramedic, testified he found Corbett had experienced \u201csevere heavy trauma to the back of the head.\u201d",
      "An autopsy two days later determined Corbett\u2019s cause of death to be blunt force head trauma, including \u201cextensive skull fractures,\u201d according to the Court of Appeals document.",
      "Deputy David Dillard from the Davidson County Sheriff\u2019s Office wrote in a report that Molly Martens was \u201cvery obviously in shock\u201d from the incident, according to the court document.",
      "He also wrote that Molly\u00a0Martens\u00a0\u201cwas making crying noises but (he) didn\u2019t see any visible tears. She was also rubbing her neck \u2026 It wasn\u2019t a constant. She would do it and stop to do it and then stop while continuing to make the crying noises.\u201d",
      "Deputies also retrieved the children, who had been sleeping undisturbed throughout the incident, according to the court document.",
      "A few days later, Jack and Sarah were separately interviewed and evaluated at a children\u2019s advocacy center in Mocksville, North Carolina.",
      "Both children said their father often got angry at Molly\u00a0Martens\u00a0for small things, and Jack said he had personally witnessed times his father \u201cpunched, hit, and pushed\u201d Molly\u00a0Martens, according to the Court of Appeals document.",
      "The children\u2019s statements were not admitted as evidence in the subsequent trial, partly because \u201cthe court (was) not assured of the children\u2019s motivation to speak the truth,\u201d according to the appeals document.",
      "Questions arose over whether the children had been coached by Molly Martens to give certain answers, so that the children would be allowed to continue living with Martens in the United States.",

Both Jack and Sarah Corbett continue to deny allegations that their father was ever abusive, and they now accuse their step-mother of manipulating them and lying about Corbett\u2019s killing, according to the documentary.",
      "Today, Jack and Sarah Corbett do not have a relationship with Molly Martens and they expressed their anger at her in the documentary.",
      "What crimes were Molly Martens and her dad charged with?",
      "In\u00a0December 2015, Molly Martens and her father, Tom Martens, were indicted by a grand jury for second-degree murder and voluntary manslaughter. They both pleaded not guilty to the charges, according to a 2020 document from the Court of Appeals of North Carolina.",
      "In August 2017, the defendants were found guilty\u00a0of second-degree murder, and both were sentenced to 20 to 25 years in prison under the custody of the North Carolina Division of Adult Correction.",
      "Molly and Tom Martens appealed the court\u2019s ruling, arguing that certain statements made by Corbett\u2019s children, Jack and Sarah, should have been included as evidence in the original trial, according to the 2020 appeals document.",
      "In 2021, both defendants were granted\u00a0a retrial. However, they both struck plea deals before the new trial began.",
      "Molly Martens pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter, meaning she accepted the charge but did not admit guilt. Her father, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter.",
      "In a 2023 document, the Davidson County Superior Court Division outlined certain mitigating factors that led to the reduced voluntary manslaughter charge for Molly Martens.",
      "The document stated that the \u201cdefendant acted under strong provocation,\u201d and committed her offense under \u201cduress,\u201d \u201ccoercion,\u201d \u201cthreat\u201d and \u201ccompulsion.\u201d",
      "These factors were not enough to justify a defense claim, but they \u201csignificantly reduced the defendant\u2019s culpability,\u201d the court found, according to the 2023 document.",
      "After Molly and Tom Martens pleaded to the reduced charge of voluntary manslaughter, they were sentenced to between 51 and 74 months, or between just over four to six years, in prison.",
      "They were given credit for the more than three-and-a-half years they had already served, meaning they would serve just an additional seven months behind bars.",
      "The father and daughter were both released from prison in June 2024.",
      "What have family members said about the case?Molly Martens\u2019 family and the Corbett family have shared very different narratives about the case, and about the nature of their relationship.",
      "Molly Martens has maintained that her late husband was emotionally and physically abusive, and that her acts on the night of Corbett's death were committed in self-defense.",
      "\u201cSometimes he would just be kind of seething and angry because I hadn\u2019t abided by something, or I\u2019d been somewhere I shouldn\u2019t have been,\u201d she alleged in the documentary. \u201cAnd sometimes that would lead to a violent situation.\u201d",
      "She also accused Corbett of coercively controlling her by not allowing her to formally adopt Jack and Sarah. She alleged that by preventing her from adopting them, Corbett ensured she would never divorce him, because she knew she would lose access to the children if she left him.",
      "Molly Martens has also accused Corbett\u2019s family of \u201cbrainwashing\u201d the children and using them \u201cas tools of evil.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been weaponized against me, and they wanted to hurt me, and they did,\u201d she said in the documentary.",
      "Tom Martens has also stood by his actions on the night of Corbett\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if a father can see something worse than watching his child die in front of him. I was going to save her life or die trying,\u201d he said in the documentary. \u201cAnd I have no regrets.\u201d",
      "He said in the documentary that he believes his daughter was abused by Corbett.",
      "\u201cMolly was becoming a shell of what she had been. She was definitely not as happy,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was definitely not as confident. She was acting beaten down. I did not realize the extent or seriousness of the domestic abuse, but I do now.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Corbett\u2019s relatives allege that Molly Martens did not kill Corbett in self-defense, and deny accusations that Corbett was abusive.",
      "Corbett\u2019s sister, Tracey Corbett-Lynch, who took care of Jack and Sarah following her brother\u2019s death, said in the documentary she wants \u201cthe world to know the truth about Jason.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was very charismatic \u2026 family meant everything to him,\u201d she said in the documentary.",
      "In February, Corbett\u2019s daughter, Sarah Corbett Lynch, now 18, released a memoir about her late dad, \u201cA Time for Truth: My Father Jason and My Search for Justice and Healing.\u201d",
      "In a March interview with Ireland\u2019s Newstalk FM, she alleged that Molly Martens had coached her and her brother to tell authorities they had witnessed domestic abuse at home.",
      "\u201cWe loved Molly and we trusted her, and we were told that if we didn\u2019t lie that we would never see each other again and that we would be taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had been coached for years. Yes, the Martens sat us down before we went into those interviews and told us that we needed to say certain things.\u201d",
      "She has also shared her belief in the documentary that her dad was \u201cthe victim\u201d in the case, and expressed her anger over the Martens\u2019 reduced sentence and release from prison.",
      "\u201cThis is not what my dad deserves, it\u2019s not what I deserve,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not right, it\u2019s not fair.\u201d",
      "Jack, now 20, also shared his belief in the documentary that his father\u2019s death was a calculated murder, not an act of self defense. He said that now, he has \u201cno feelings\u201d toward Molly Martens.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t hate her, I just don\u2019t want to give her any power over me anymore,\u201d he said.",

      "Eyes closed, foot tapping on the dark hardwood floor, Ela Taubert tucks a pink strand of hair behind her ears. The 24-year-old singer-songwriter is vibing to her debut album, \u201cPreguntas a Las 11:11.\u201d",
      "A new voice among Latin pop music, Taubert is cementing herself as one to watch with her heartbreak anthems, raw and sharp lyrics, catchy melodies and messages of empowerment and hope.",
      "Taubert has been catching the industry\u2019s and people\u2019s attention over the last year. The Colombian musician won the best new artist Latin Grammy Award in November, following her energetic performance of \u201c\u00bfC\u00f3mo Pas\u00f3?\u201d with Joe Jonas. She collaborated with the singer after she DM\u2019d him on Instagram \u2014 and he responded.",
      "\u201cWorking with Ela was one of those rare moments where the energy in the room just clicks. She has this beautiful vulnerability in her voice that immediately pulls you in,\u201d Jonas tells TODAY.com. \u201cFrom the first demo, I knew this song had heart \u2014 and collaborating with her just made it even more special. She brings so much truth to her music, and it was a privilege to be a part of that.\u201d",
      "The Jonas Brother adds that Taubert has a \u201cquiet power\u201d when it comes to her songwriting that \u201cfeels personal and poetic, but also universal. That balance is hard to find.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s creating her own space in Latin pop, and you can feel her heart in every lyric and melody. I love working with artists who have a real point of view, and she definitely does,\u201d he says.",

      "\u201cSince I was a little girl, anytime I would see the time 11:11 or the numbers together, I would make a wish,\u201d Taubert tells TODAY.com in Spanish about the significance of the album's title. \u201cI was always a horrible overthinker, a person who would ask myself the same questions over and over again.\u201d",
      "One night at 11:11 p.m., she recalls, she hoped a certain someone would write her back. They did.",
      "\u201cThen I began to think, \u2018Why did you ask for that?\u2019\u201d she says, making her further spiral. This nightly ritual of asking questions and making wishes inspired her album. \u201cThis is like a midnight diary of all the questions I\u2019ve asked myself over the last 10 years.\u201d",

Despite releasing her debut single, \u201cSalto de Fe\u201d (\u201cLeap of Faith\u201d in Spanish), in 2019, Taubert gained fans with her unique covers. In 2023, the singer caught the attention of Colombian reggaetonero Feid (and Billboard) when she put a melancholic twist on his song \u201cSi Te La Encuentras Por Ah\u00ed.\u201d From there, she began working with the Latin Grammy-winning Julio Reyes Copello and was part of the inaugural generation of aspiring singers in Universal Music Latino\u2019s Abbey Road Institute & Art House Academy.",

      "\u201cAll the song titles are questions, with Track 11 being the most special,\u201d Taubert teases. \u201cThe way they are listed is so people can feel a roller coaster of emotions, from falling in and out of love, making mistakes and growing up.\u201d",

      "\u201c\u2018\u00bfTe Imaginas?\u2019 is a song where I ask myself, \u2018Imagine if I hadn\u2019t been scared, maybe I wouldn\u2019t have done things in that way,\u2019\u201d she explains.",
      "'\u00bfQui\u00e9n Soy Yo Para Juzgar?'",
      "For Track Eight, Taubert asks, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d The spicy and in-your-face song, she says, is about her first boyfriend in school and what she\u2019s heard about him from her hometown friends.",
      "She jokes that when getting the tea on her ex, she thinks, \u201cWe listen and we don\u2019t judge.\u201d",
      "\"I was very young but it was my first heartbreak and it hit me hard,\" she says with a laugh. \"Looking back at it, I can laugh and say, 'You haven't changed at all!'\"",
      "Taubert notes that her favorite part of the song is the pre-chorus and chorus, which makes her chuckle thinking of the absurdity of her first love.",

      "'\u00bfQu\u00e9 M\u00e1s Quieres?'",
      "By the ninth song, the emotions explode. Taubert says that she wrote \u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 M\u00e1s Quieres?\u201d \u201ccon mucha rabia,\u201d or \u201cwith a lot of anger\u201d about another undisclosed former lover.",
      "The title translates to \u201cwhat more do you want.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a point in the album where you say the things as they are, as you feel them. It\u2019s not coming from a place of processing (your feelings), rather from anger and tears,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s the moment you explode.\u201d",
      "She feels that many of her fans might not know that part of her, but hopes they can relate to the song and know it\u2019s OK to vent and let the frustration out.",
      "'Preguntas'",
      "Track 11, which translates to \u201cQuestions,\u201d is Taubert\u2019s \u201cmost personal\u201d song that touches on the special moments in her life. She describes the song as a sequel to her 2022 single \u201cCrecer\u201d and touches on the growing pains of life and everything she has gone through since moving to the U.S.",
      "Three years later, Taubert is making her dream come true as a singer-songwriter. Yet, as she sings in the track, she's lost half of her friends and has experienced the death of a loved one, her grandfather.",
      "\u201cI always thought I was very alone in how I felt about these types of situations, but my song \u2018Crecer\u2019 showed me that more people feel the way I do,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery lyric in this song describes every piece of who I am in the most blue and vulnerable way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe chorus says, \u2018You will be OK, I will be fine, so is life and you have to embrace it,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "She and her producer Kevin Aguirre wrote the song last year during a blue moon and decided to incorporate the sound of the ocean that was nearby."

      "Reba McEntire on cowboy boot collection",
      "For those who can\u2019t incorporate a room filled with cowboy boots into their space, McEntire says she makes a house a home through pictures, family and pets. She says the location is also of importance, as well as \u201chow it makes you feel inside and out.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd then if the kitchen is really good,\u201d McEntire continues. \u201cI have to have a good kitchen, not because I\u2019m a good cook but because no matter how many people you bring over to your house for a party, everybody winds up in the kitchen.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s a very important place,\u201d she adds.",

      "\u201cOh, the scheduling was totally it,\u201d she says, before crediting a new Season 27 judge. \u201cI thought Kelsey Ballerini did such a great job. That was a really good pick with her.\u201d",
      "The energy and chemistry among \u201cThe Voice\u201d judges is \u201cvery important,\u201d McEntire says. \u201cFans are not stupid. They know when people are not getting along and they\u2019re acting like they are.\u201d",

      "As someone who sat next to Snoop Dogg for the entirety of the singing competition show season, McEntire says some fans might not realize that he \u201cgives out some of the best one-liners.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was so glad I got to sit by him because a lot of times he\u2019ll say stuff and people might not hear it, but I was very entertained all the time sitting by Snoop,\u201d McEntire adds.",
      "The virality of 'I'm a Survivor' over 20 years later",
      "If McEntire\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a Survivor\u201d doesn\u2019t resonate from being a Billboard No. 1 hit when it released in 2001, anyone on TikTok surely recognizes the tune.",
      "Ushering a new generation of McEntire fans, the song has gone viral on the social media platform, particularly the following lines: \u201cA single mom who works two jobs/ Who loves her kids and never stops/ With gentle hands and the heart of a fighter/ I\u2019m a survivor.\u201d",
      "The popular videos typically capture a person dramatically completing mundane tasks to no recognition.",
      "McEntire even hopped on the trend herself, sharing a video carrying two buckets of food across the yard to feed her donkeys. In the caption, she wrote, \u201cWhen it\u2019s time to feed your donkeys and they\u2019re not the least bit impressed.\u201d",
      "McEntire reminds that the hit song is \u201cfairly old,\u201d but is not surprised that the relatability remains years later.",
      "\u201cAll of us are survivors. We\u2019ve been through situations that are different from our neighbor, our family members, and we get through them by the grace of God,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cSo, \u2018I\u2019m a Survivor\u2019 is a relatable song, and that\u2019s when you know you found a song that touched people\u2019s hearts,\u201d McEntire adds.",
      "When she was originally pitched the song, the three-time Grammy Award winner recalls listening and thinking about her cousin, who she says has \u201cbeen through an awful lot,\u201d then remembering her own journey.",
      "\u201cIt all goes back to a successful song is a song that people can relate to,\u201d McEntire says. \u201cAnd then when they relate to it, they sing along with it; and when they sing along with it, they\u2019re a part of the concert. They\u2019re part of the of every aspect of the song.\u201d",
      "Reba McEntire reveals dream collabs \u2014 with 1 singer outside country altogether",

      "Reminiscing on the \u201chealthy\u201d shifts within country music, McEntire says, \u201cIt's gone cyclical. It\u2019s gone contemporary. It\u2019s gone traditional. It\u2019ll go back and forth. It\u2019s a different kind of country music than what I grew up on.\u201d",

      "Reba McEntire on role of country artists",
      "When it comes to the greats, McEntire says her \"Mount Rushmore of country artists\" would be Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Barbara Mandrell and Merle Haggard.",
      "\u201cThey were very strong people who came from assorted backgrounds, most of them with very rough upbringings, with lessons that they can teach other people in their songs, in their stories, in their biographies, in their documentaries,\u201d McEntire says.",
      "She continued, \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019re put on Earth for \u2013 to help heal people who have hurts, and that you can help heal those hurts by past experiences.\u201d",
      "Music specifically, McEntire explains, is \u201cso valuable\u201d when it comes to healing because \u201cyou can tell in a song things that you can\u2019t tell in person because it might be too personal.\u201d",
      "As for whom she hopes to collaborate with next, McEntire says, \u201cI\u2019ve always said Bette Midler. I think she\u2019d be a hoot to create a song with.\u201d",
      "But McEntire gave another dream singing partner, who has taken the pop world by storm but has yet to publicly give country a try.",
      "\u201cDua Lipa, I met her at an award show last year, and I\u2019d never met her before. I was not familiar with her music,\u201d she says. \u201cNow in my concerts, I do \u2018Don\u2019t Start Now\u2019 I watched her documentaries and her concerts, and she\u2019s wonderful.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "MOSCOW \u2014 President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy broke with long-standing protocol by not employing his own interpreter during three high-level meetings with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin, opting instead to rely on translators from the Kremlin, a U.S.\u00a0official and two Western officials with knowledge of the talks told NBC News.",
      "Steve Witkoff, who has been tasked with negotiating an end to the war in Ukraine, met with Putin in Moscow for several hours on Feb. 11, on March 13, and in St. Petersburg on April 11, and \u201cused their translators,\u201d one of the Western officials said. \u201cIf they speak to each other in Russian, he doesn\u2019t know what they are saying,\u201d the official added, referring to Putin and the interpreters.",
      "Witkoff, a former real estate mogul and cryptocurrency trader, does not speak Russian. By using Kremlin interpreters, he ran the risk that some of the nuance in Putin\u2019s messages was missed and he would not have been able to independently verify what was being said to him, two former American ambassadors said.",
      "Anna Kelly, a White House deputy press secretary, said in a statement that Witkoff \u201cabides by all security protocols in coordination with the State Department.\u201d  Witkoff\u2019s team did not respond. Both the State Department and the Kremlin have also been asked for comment.",
      "Tens of thousands of people have been killed since Putin launched his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump campaigned on ending the war on \u201cday one\u201d and has made it one of his top priorities. Putin, meanwhile, has shown little interest in ending the conflict, and in remarks broadcast Sunday, referenced Russia\u2019s nuclear capability as he talked about bringing the war to an end.",
      "The Russian leader, who is known to speak some English, communicates through an interpreter during negotiations and when he is conducting official meetings. At a meeting with Witkoff on April 25, he was flanked by his special adviser Yuri Ushakov, who served as Russia\u2019s ambassador to the United States between 1998 and 2008, and Kirill Dmitriev, his special envoy for investment and economic cooperation. An interpreter joined Putin\u2019s team.",
      "A short video of the meeting released by the Kremlin shows a smiling Witkoff entering the room alone before he shakes hands with Putin, who is also broadly beaming. Witkoff does not appear to be accompanied by any advisers or experts who typically support American officials conducting delicate and complicated negotiations.",
      "As a woman joined Witkoff on his side of the table, he pointed at her and\u00a0said, \u201cInterpreter? From the embassy? OK.\u201d",
      "Kelly, the White House deputy press secretary and Witkoff\u2019s team did not identify the woman when asked by NBC News. The State Department, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and the Kremlin have also been asked for comment.",
      "Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said using the Kremlin\u2019s interpreter was \u201ca very bad idea\u201d that put Witkoff \u201cat a real disadvantage.\u201d",
      "\u201cI speak Russian and have listened to Kremlin interpreters and U.S. interpreters at the same meeting, and the language is never the same,\u201d McFaul said via email Wednesday.",
      "Having a U.S. interpreter present also ensures a more accurate written account of the meeting for the rest of the government, known as a memorandum of conversation or \u201cmemcon,\u201d said McFaul, now professor of political science at Stanford University.",
      "\u201cAt the end of every meeting that I attended, I debriefed the interpreter to make sure we heard everything correctly, to get the \u2018memcom\u2019 exactly right. You can\u2019t do that using a Russian official,\u201d he added.",
      "Not having detailed notes about the meetings could create problems for other senior members of the Trump administration, like Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, as they try to advance discussions, McFaul said.",
      "\u201cHow does Kellogg know what Witkoff agreed to with Putin? He only knows it through a \u2018memcom,\u2019\u201d he added.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s dealings with sensitive information as he plays a key role in trying to resolve not only the war in Ukraine, but also the conflict in Gaza and the nuclear deal with Iran, have also raised eyebrows.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s plane, which he uses to fly to Russia for the meetings, is not fitted with a secure government communications system, according to two Western officials, including one previously quoted in this article. However, the officials said he has made sensitive calls from the U.S. Embassy before boarding the plane and has a secure cellphone.",
      "NBC News approached the White House National Security Council for comment and was referred to Witkoff\u2019s team, which did not respond. The State Department has also been asked for comment.",
      "Witkoff\u2019s efforts appear to have yielded little results in ending the war, at least from Russia\u2019s side.",
      "A proposal that Trump should meet with Putin on his trip to Saudi Arabia next week was nixed because there was no movement on Russia\u2019s part toward a ceasefire, according to two administration officials and one U.S. official familiar with the planning. A meeting would have been contingent on Russia agreeing to a ceasefire in Ukraine, the administration officials said.",
      "Separately, a European official said intelligence assessments indicate Putin remains committed to maximalist goals in the war in Ukraine and has no interest in coming to a negotiated settlement.",
      "Putin has previously said he wants Ukraine to withdraw from four regions \u2014 Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson \u2014 which Russia illegally annexed shortly after invading Ukraine in February 2022. He has also insisted that Ukraine promise never to join NATO, accept restrictions on the size of its army, and protect Russian culture and language inside the country.",
      "Since his last meeting with Witkoff, the White House has signed an \u201ceconomic partnership\u201d with Ukraine that will give Washington access to some of the war-torn nation\u2019s critical minerals and natural resources.",
      "\u201cThe Ukrainians have been cooperative, flexible, supportive and eager to move forward, but the Russians have not,\u201d said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and now a fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, adding that it was \u201cstandard, basic practice that you have your own interpreter,\u201d in high-level diplomatic meetings.",
      "Ukraine, he said, had agreed to U.S. proposals on a comprehensive air, sea and land ceasefire, while extending a truce to Black Sea shipping lanes.",
      "A \u201cterm sheet\u201d with 22 proposals, including a 30-day ceasefire, has been drawn up by American, European and Ukrainian negotiators, one of the Western officials said, adding that it met Putin\u2019s demand that the U.S. will not support Ukraine joining NATO.",
      "\u201cIf Putin wants a way out, here is his way out,\u201d the official said of the proposals. Witkoff will have to present them to the Russian president, they added.",
      "In remarks published Sunday, Putin said Russia had sufficient strength and resources to take the war in Ukraine to its logical conclusion, though he hoped there would be no need to use nuclear weapons.",
      "In a film broadcast by state television titled \u201cRussia, Kremlin, Putin, 25 years,\u201d he said, \u201cThere has been no need to use those weapons ... and I hope they will not be required.\u201d",
      "Keir Simmons reported from Moscow. Carol Lee, Dan De Luce and Courtney Kube reported from Washington, D.C."

Born prematurely, Yussuf is now suffering from acute malnutrition, with the family unable to obtain formula or medication as Israel\u2019s blockade of aid and goods reaching Gaza enters its third month.",
      "After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that he would give an order to ramp up the military offensive in Gaza with a plan to seize the entire strip, Yussuf\u2019s future is increasingly uncertain. Palestinians and observers fear fresh bombings and displacement, and aid groups warn of a spiraling humanitarian crisis marked by scarce food supplies.",
      "Yussuf is among the 9,000 children in Gaza to have been admitted or treated for acute malnutrition since the war began, with UNICEF saying in March that it had seen a surge in cases.

      "\u201cIsn\u2019t it a sin for a child to die like this?\u201d Al-Najjar, 30, told NBC News\u2019 crew on the ground, her face wracked with grief.",

      "Around 1,200 people were killed and more than 250 were taken hostage into Gaza in the attacks, with more than 50 people, both dead and alive, believed to remain in Hamas' captivity, according to Israeli officials.",
      "The families of hostages who remain held in Gaza have warned that a ramped-up offensive will only put the lives of their loved ones at further risk.",
      "Meanwhile, right-wing ministers in Netanyahu\u2019s fragile government coalition celebrated the plans for an expanded offensive, having advocated for such a move before and after the last ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, which held for two months from Jan. 19 to March 18.",
      "Prior to that ceasefire, the Israeli military had taken control of around a third of Gaza.",
      "Even so, hopes remained in Gaza and Israel for a resumption of that truce ahead of a visit from President Donald Trump to the region planned for next week.",

      "From outside of his Cabinet, Netanyahu has faced growing criticism for resuming and expanding Israel's offensive in Gaza. The latest denunciation came from Eran Duvdevani, a prominent retired colonel who led a campaign by former and reserve Israeli paratroopers calling for an end to the war.",
      "Duvdevani told NBC News that a growing number of reservists were already rejecting calls to return to service in a war they increasingly view as politically motivated.",
      "He added that without a fresh truce between Israel and Hamas, Trump's intervention was likely the only thing that could stop an expanded offensive.",
      "\"This is the only way, to press Netanyahu,\" Duvdevani said in a phone interview early Tuesday. \"Nothing will happen if Trump will not press him.\"",

      "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan \u2014 Pakistan said that  India fired missiles at three air bases inside the country Saturday but most of the missiles were intercepted and that retaliatory strikes on India were underway. It\u2019s the latest escalation in a conflict triggered by a massacre last month that India blames on Pakistan.",
      "The Pakistani military said it used medium-range Fateh missiles to target an Indian missile storage facility and airbases in Pathankot and Udhampur.",
      "Army spokesman Lt. Gen. Ahmad Sharif said that Pakistan's air force assets were safe following the Indian strikes. He added that some of the Indian missiles also hit India\u2019s eastern Punjab.",
      "\u201cThis is a provocation of the highest order,\u201d Sharif said. There was no immediate comment from India.",
      "State-run Pakistan Television reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has convened a meeting of the National Command Authority, the body responsible for overseeing the country\u2019s missile program and other strategic assets.",
      "Tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals have soared since an attack at a popular tourist site in India-controlled Kashmir left 26 civilians dead, mostly Hindu Indian tourists, on April 22. New Delhi has blamed Pakistan for backing the assault, an accusation Islamabad rejects.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Pakistani Army Chief Asim Munir on Friday.",
      "State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Rubio continued to urge both parties to \u201cfind ways to deescalate and offered U.S. assistance in starting constructive talks\u201d in order to avoid future conflicts.",
      "The call for calm came ahead of Saturday\u2019s Indian missile strikes, which targeted Nur Khan air base in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, near the capital Islamabad, Murid air base in Chakwal city and Rafiqui air base in the Jhang district of eastern Punjab province, according to Pakistan\u2019s military spokesman.",
      "There was no media access to the air base in Rawalpindi, a densely populated city, and no immediate reports of residents hearing or seeing the strike or its aftermath.",
      "Following the announcement of Pakistani retaliation, residents in Indian-controlled Kashmir said they heard loud explosions at multiple places in the region, including the two big cities of Srinagar and Jammu, and the garrison town of Udhampur.",
      "\u201cExplosions that we are hearing today are different from the ones we heard the last two nights during drone attacks,\u201d said Shesh Paul Vaid, the region\u2019s former top police official and Jammu resident. \u201cIt looks like a war here.\u201d",
      "Vaid said explosions were heard from areas with military bases, adding it appeared that army sites were being targeted.",
      "Srinagar appeared calm early Saturday but some residents in neighborhoods close to the city\u2019s airport, which is also an air base, said they were rattled by the explosions and booming sound of fighter jets.",
      "\u201cI was already awake but the explosions jolted my kids out of their sleep. They started crying,\u201d said Srinagar resident Mohammed Yasin, adding he heard at least two explosions.",
      "Praveen Donthi, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group for India, said the two countries were at war even if they had not yet labelled it as one.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become a remorseless race for military one-upmanship with no apparent strategic end goals from either side,\u201d said Donthi. \u201cWith increasing civilian casualties on both sides, finding an exit or off-ramp is going to be challenging.\u201d",
      "India\u2019s army said it destroyed multiple armed Pakistani drones that were spotted flying over a military cantonment in northern Punjab state\u2019s Amritsar city early Saturday.",
      "\u201cPakistan\u2019s blatant attempt to violate India\u2019s sovereignty and endanger civilians is unacceptable.\u201d the statement said.",

      "\u201cThe situation is under close and constant watch, and prompt action is being taken wherever necessary,\u201d the statement added.",
      "India and Pakistan have traded strikes and heavy cross-border fire for days, resulting in civilian casualties on both sides.",

      "They added that the original event did not take place because of Japan\u2019s \u201cintensifying war\u201d in the region.",

      "But after wondering whether it could be used for this year's event, he said he approached the organizers who agreed he could use it.",
      "\u201cThis is my first expo, and I feel part of history,\u201d he said, adding that he visited the Czech and Saudi Arabian pavilions at the expo. \u201cThe person who had this ticket before me waited 85 years, and now their wish finally came true,\u201d he said.",
      "Although he lives in Tokyo, he said he would like to revisit the expo when he travels to Osaka to see his family.",

      "The event in 1940 is known as the \u201cphantom Expo\u201d as it never happened, the organizers said, adding that those with tickets for it have previously been allowed to attend the 1970 expo in Osaka and the 2005 expo in the Japanese prefecture of Aichi.",

    "story": [
      "The election of an American as pope is being recognized as a historic choice, but Chicago-born missionary Robert Prevost represents another notable departure from pontiffs of the past.",
      "Prevost, 69, is the first Augustinian friar to become pope, the Vatican News reported.",
      "\"The fact that the pope is from the Augustinian order is the most surprising thing for me,\" Charles Gillespie, an assistant professor of Catholic Studies at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut, said Friday. \"It's extraordinary, and it's been rare for a reason.\"",
      "Prevost, who took the name Leo XIV after being elected Thursday to guide the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, had assumed several leadership roles within the Catholic Order of St. Augustine.",
      "The order, formed in the 13th century and based on the writings of Augustine of Hippo, a theologian who lived in modern-day Algeria, is smaller compared to other religious communities within the church. It has about 2,800 members in 47 countries, and sponsors just two universities within the United States: Villanova near Philadelphia, which Prevost attended, and Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "Friars of the Augustinian order typically stand out in hooded black habits made of wool. Rather than being cloistered in a monastery, they live a mendicant lifestyle, in which they go out into the community and rely on charitable kindness, Gillespie said.",
      "\u201cThey place a real, prayerful emphasis on the heart, and the beauty in the world as it connects with God,\u201d he added.",
      "An Augustinian friars\u2019 purpose is to serve with humility within their communities. Until Leo, it was unlikely that a member would be called on to leave the order and take on a larger responsibility in the upper echelons of the Catholic Church, much less become pope, Gillespie said.",
      "The largest male Catholic order is the Jesuits, with about 16,000 members worldwide and more than two dozen higher education institutions in the U.S.",
      "Notably, Prevost's predecessor, Francis, was the first Jesuit \u2014 and first from Latin America \u2014 to become pope.",
      "Historically, popes have not been associated with any specific religious order, but instead have been former priests who've ascended the church's hierarchy from diocesan seminaries and parishes. Before Francis, the last pope from a religious order was Gregory XVI, a Benedictine Camaldolese monk who was pope from 1831 to 1846, according to America magazine, a Jesuit publication.",
      "\"I cannot help but reflect on what his Augustinian papacy will mean to our University community and our world,\" the Rev. Peter Donohue, president of Villanova, said in a statement. \"Known for his humility, gentle spirit, prudence and warmth, Pope Leo XIV's leadership offers an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to our educational mission.\"",
      "In 1977, the year that he graduated from Villanova, Prevost joined the Order of St. Augustine. He would go on to be ordained as a priest in 1982 and then sent to an Augustinian mission in Peru in 1985.",
      "Upon returning to his hometown, Chicago, in 1999, Prevost was promoted within the order's ranks until Francis elevated him as a bishop in Peru in 2015, and eventually rising to a cardinal in 2023. One of his last jobs before becoming pope was in Rome, running the office that helps decide who will be appointed a bishop.",
      "Martin Luther, who in the 16th-century would reject Catholicism and become central to the Protestant Reformation, was a former Augustinian friar.",
      "Gillespie said given Pope Leo's background, he is certain to follow in Francis' footsteps when it comes to being a moral voice focused on unity, humanity and understanding social issues.",
      "\"With Augustinians, there's going to be a real sense that our political involvements and spiritual commitments can't be in separate lanes,\" he said. \"They're about responding to the world, how we organize our social lives, and knowing it's centered out of God's love.\""

      "Records from Will County show a Robert F. Prevost (the new pontiff's birth name) registered in the county using an address that belongs to the pope's brother. His brother confirmed that Prevost receives his mail at that address as well. Those records show Prevost voting in the 2012, 2014 and 2016 Republican primaries, as well as in the 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2024 general elections.",
      "Voters in Illinois do not register by party, so Prevost's decision to vote in Republican primaries doesn't necessarily mean he is a Republican. Instead, voters can select which party's primary they want to vote for each year, and are not bound to pick the same party year-to-year.",
      "Now that Prevost has been named pope, details like his voting history, social media footprint and more have gained new relevance.",
      "An occasional user of social media in recent years, Prevost had occasionally posted on X criticism of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance, as well as their policies. One recent post from another user that Prevost shared on his account criticizes Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele over the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia\u00a0of Maryland, linking to a Catholic newspaper piece.",

      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 The U.S. now has two top-level leaders on the global stage \u2014 and there is evidence to suggest Pope Leo XIV will cut a stark contrast with President Donald Trump.",
      "The Chicago-born pontiff, 69, is known as a humble moderate who used his first papal words to urge building \u201cbridges.\u201d Seen as a spiritual successor to the late Pope Francis, Leo was echoing his predecessor\u2019s refrain of building \u201cbridges not walls\u201d \u2014 a theme Francis used to openly criticize the Trump administration.",
      "As Cardinal Robert Prevost, Leo also criticized both Trump and Vice President JD Vance on social media. As recently as February, he shared a headline saying that Vance, who is Catholic, was \u201cwrong\u201d to suggest Christians should prioritize loving their countrymen over foreigners.",
      "And like Francis, Leo has expressed deep sympathy for migrants, the poor and those affected by the climate crisis. He has shared the late pope\u2019s support for appointing women to senior Vatican roles \u2014 and his resistance against going all-out in support of female ordination. And he has similarly advocated for an inclusive church that reaches out to other faiths and cultures.",
      "On the other hand, he has not followed Francis\u2019 relative support for LGBTQ+ communities, lamenting in 2012 how TV shows \u201cbenignly and sympathetically portrayed\u201d same-sex couples, according to a report by The Arlington Catholic Herald at the time.",
      "The lock-in secrecy of the conclave means we don\u2019t know why the 133 cardinal electors voted for Leo by at least a two-thirds majority. And scholars are divided about how the decision should be interpreted.",
      "For Steven Millies, a professor of public theology at the Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, it\u2019s an unambiguous repudiation of the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe cardinals took a side: This new pope will stand against this 21st-century variety of authoritarianism we see getting underway in the U.S. and in too many other parts of the globe,\u201d Millies told NBC News. \u201cTo choose an American while a second Trump administration is deporting, disappearing [people] and disrupting to such an alarming extent, again, is a message.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment about these criticisms, the White House directed NBC News toward a social media post in which Trump said it was a \u201cgreat honor\u201d to have an American pope and that he looked forward to meeting him, and one from Vance saying he was \u201csure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the church.\u201d",
      "Millies likens the cardinals\u2019 choice to the conclave of 1978, when they selected a Polish pontiff in John Paul II, \u201cfrom behind the Iron Curtain,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cardinals were taking a side \u2014 they aimed a new pope at the Soviet Union.\u201d",
      "Others are less sure about the conclave\u2019s intentions.",
      "\u201cEither they\u2019ve chosen an American because they think it sends a message that he stands up to Donald Trump and offers an alternative vision of American leadership, or they\u2019ve chosen him despite the fact that he\u2019s American,\u201d said Miles Pattenden, a historian of the Catholic Church at Britain\u2019s University of Oxford.",
      "\u201cIt would seem to me to be rather sensational if they picked him just because he was American and could stand up to President Trump,\u201d he added, if nothing else because Trump\u2019s term is brief compared with a potential papal lifetime.",
      "Whatever the cardinals\u2019 reasoning, they have elected a pope whose personality is night and day to Trump\u2019s brusque persona.",
      "Leo is \u201ca quietly confident person, not a flashy personality,\u201d Bishop Robert Barron of the Diocese of Winona-Rochester, Minnesota, told NBC\u2019s \u201cNightly News\u201d on Thursday. These are qualities that few, including Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters, would attribute to the president.",
      "Even the new pope\u2019s name carries hints he may oppose Trump\u2019s worldview. The last pontiff to take this name was Pope Leo XIII, who in his 25-year papacy, from 1878 to 1903, advocated for social justice and workers rights against the nascent forces of capitalism.",
      "\u201cThe pope is not going to agree with anything Trump is saying,\u201d said Bill Ciotti, 63, from Boston, who before he retired was responsible for planning liturgy at his church. Ciotti was staying in Rome, a 10-minute walk from the Vatican, with his friend Bill Champlin, a priest at St. Leo Parish in Leominster, Massachusetts. When they saw white smoke billowing on TV while eating dinner, they got up and ran to St. Peter\u2019s Square.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s already criticized Trump and Vance, so I think it\u2019s going to be a major clash,\u201d Ciotti said Friday.",
      "Politically, Leo is \u201cnot going to be real far left and he\u2019s not going to be real far right,\u201d his brother John Prevost said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. But he is widely seen as continuing the program that Francis started, which was disliked by many conservative U.S. Catholics.",
      "\u201cI do think one of the dark horses, and unfortunately one of the most progressive, is Cardinal Prevost,\u201d former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, who is Catholic and strongly opposed Francis\u2019 platform, said before Leo was elected. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty shocking given the contempt in which they hold the American church.\u201d He added that \u201cmy understanding is Prevost is one of the closest to Francis ideologically.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, believers and nonbelievers alike will have to wait and see how the Trump-Leo era plays out.",

      "President Donald Trump has signaled a willingness to drastically cut the U.S.' current 145% tariff rate on China ahead of trade talks between the two countries.",
      "Trump wrote in a Truth Social post Friday morning: \"80% Tariff on China seems right! Up to Scott B.,\" appearing to refer to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "The post comes a day before Bessent and U.S. Trade Rep. Jamieson Greer meet with their Chinese counterparts in Geneva for trade discussions.",
      "Trump indicated Thursday that he might be open to lowering the current 145% tariff on China. \u201c\u00a0I mean, we\u2019re going to see. Right now, you can\u2019t get any higher,\u201d he said during remarks from the Oval Office.",
      "A representative for the Chinese embassy in the U.S. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "An 80% across-the-board tariff would still be far beyond the duties the U.S. had in place on China before Trump took office. He first imposed a 20% levy on America's third-largest source of imports in response to its alleged inaction on curbing fentanyl flows, then signed an executive order several weeks later imposing 125% duties.",
      "In general, Trump's unwieldy approach to tariffs negotiations has continued unabated: On Thursday, he announced an agreement was being worked out with the U.K. that contained few details but which would leave the U.S.'s 10% across-the-board duty on all countries mostly intact. Yet while the agreement signaled pathways to expand U.S. exports of beef, ethanol and other agricultural products, it provided no guarantees, as yet, that the U.K. would actually increase imports of those products.",
      "Trump has attempted to walk back the eye-watering country-by-country duties he announced during his shock \"Liberation Day\" speech more than a month ago.",
      "But sizable levies remain, including 25% duties on all steel, aluminum and auto imports. While discussion of trade deals remains plentiful, actual progress on them has been relatively scarce \u2014\u00a0leaving business confidence throttled.",
      "A number of companies have already changed their forward guidance or reversed it entirely as a result of the uncertainty.",
      "It's also not clear that the China tariffs are having Trump's desired effect. In April, according to CNBC calculations, China\u2019s exports surged amid a ramp up in shipments to Southeast Asian countries \u2014 an indicator that China may simply be increasing trans-shipment of goods to third-party countries that then export to the U.S., an expert told CNBC."

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with officials in both countries Thursday in the latest U.S. effort to ease tensions.",
      "Speaking with Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Rubio reiterated his condolences over the April 22 terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir, which killed 26 people, most of them Indian tourists. He also \u201creaffirmed the United States\u2019 commitment to work with India in the fight against terrorism,\u201d the State Department said.",
      "In his call with Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Rubio \u201cexpressed sorrow for the reported loss of civilian lives in the current conflict,\u201d\u00a0the State Department said, and \u201creiterated his calls for Pakistan to take concrete steps to end any support for terrorist groups.\u201d",
      "Speaking with NBC News, an official Indian government source dismissed the idea of the U.S. or any other country playing a central mediating role, saying the issues were bilateral and that the message of any government to Pakistan should be to stop supporting terrorism.\u00a0The source said that India\u2019s strikes targeted terrorist infrastructure and followed 15 days of waiting for the Pakistani government to take its own action against militant groups.",
      "An official Pakistani government source called India\u2019s strikes \u201cthe ultimate act of provocation.\u201d The source said that the actions taken by Pakistan so far have been in self-defense and that Pakistan reserves the right to respond to strikes on its soil.",
      "Pakistan has called for a \u201cneutral\u201d international investigation into the Kashmir attack, and the government source said there was \u201cno shred of evidence\u201d that Islamabad had supported it.",
      "President Donald Trump has not engaged directly with the leaders of India and Pakistan but said Wednesday that he wants \u201cto see them work it out\u201d and that \u201cif I can do anything to help, I will be there.\u201d",
      "Lisa Curtis, an expert on South Asia\u00a0at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, said the Trump administration had sent mixed signals to the two countries and needs to \u201cclean up\u201d its public messaging.",
      "Trump initially said the U.S. would not get involved in the crisis, and on Thursday Vice President JD Vance told Fox News, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get involved in the middle of a war that\u2019s fundamentally none of our business.\u201d",
      "Rubio has made measured statements calling for reducing tensions, while Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said India had a right to defend itself.",
      "The U.S. has previously played a key role in defusing conflicts between India and Pakistan, said Curtis, who was senior director for South and Central Asia on the National Security Council from 2017 to 2021. But U.S. relations with Pakistan have deteriorated in recent years, calling into question Washington\u2019s influence with Islamabad.",
      "The U.S. has left the door open to supporting Pakistan\u2019s call for further investigation into the terrorist attack.",
      "\u201cWe want the perpetrators to be held accountable, and are supportive of any efforts to that end,\u201d State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Thursday.",
      "India responded to the attack by launching military strikes on \u201cterror camps\u201d in Pakistan early Wednesday, which according to Pakistan killed 31 people, including civilians. Pakistan immediately claimed partial victory saying it had downed five Indian fighter jets and dozens of drones, which India has not confirmed.",
      "The April 22 attack was the worst of its kind on Indian civilians in two decades and capped years of separatist insurgency and the bitter resentment between the two neighbors over Kashmir, a former princely state and the only Muslim-majority part of India which ceded territory to India in 1947 when the British colonial rule ended.",
      "Pakistan and India have since fought three out of their multiple wars over it, and India has long-accused Pakistan of supporting cross-border terrorism, which Islamabad denies. Both countries now lay claim to Kashmir in full but only partly control."

    "story": [
      "VATICAN CITY \u2014 Pope Leo XIV has inherited a raging battle for not only the soul of the Catholic Church, but also its place in the geopolitical world.",
      "The new pope will have to decide whether his global pulpit will continue Pope Francis\u2019 broadly progressive legacy, or revert to a more conservative approach. The first American pontiff will grapple with the spiritual decline in the church\u2019s European power base, coupled with its rise in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. And he will be forced to confront the legacy of the decadeslong sexual abuse scandal.",
      "\u201cUsually the most important thing that the pope has to take care of is the Catholic Church \u2014 but right now it\u2019s much more complicated because we are in a time of global disruption,\u201d said Massimo Faggioli, a professor and world-leading expert on the church\u2019s inner workings, based at Villanova University. \u201cThe church is much more global than ever before, so the cardinals will have to consider what it means to elect a global leader of the Catholic Church in this situation.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a look at what\u2019s in the ecclesiastical inbox:",
      "Sexual abuse scandal",
      "After hundreds of thousands of cases emerged in dozens of countries over the past century, the church\u2019s endemic sexual abuse scandal is far from resolved.",
      "Cases continue to be uncovered, and although Francis went further than his predecessors in addressing this, campaigners said he did nowhere near enough.",
      "\u201cThe next pope must institute a zero tolerance law for sexual abuse that immediately removes abusive clergy and leaders who have covered up abuse from ministry,\u201d Survivors Network of Those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, a Chicago-based watchdog, said before Leo was elected.",
      "\u201cHe must use his authority to enact fundamental, institutional changes to end the systematic practice of sexual abuse and its concealment,\u201d it said.",
      "Ideology",
      "Francis was widely seen as a progressive force, at least compared with predecessors and peers. He allowed priests to informally bless same-sex couples, asking, \u201cWho am I to judge?\u201d And over doctrinal dogma he favored topics such as global capitalism and the climate crisis.",
      "Though this was not cut-and-dried (he likened abortions to \u201chiring a hitman\u201d), his message enraged conservative traditionalists, including those on the American hard right, who would like to see Francis\u2019 successor revert to what they believe are the church\u2019s core teachings.",
      "\u201cIn a time when illiberalism is gaining ground internationally,\u201d Francis\u2019 \u201cmessaging was an unexpected oasis for many, and unwelcomingly out of step for others,\u201d said Effie Fokas, a research associate specializing in geopolitics and religion at the London School of Economics and Political Science before Thursday\u2019s election of Leo.",
      "\u201cSo there is great anticipation over whether the church will, on the one hand, choose to be an oasis or, rather, in step with the waves of right-wing conservatism sweeping over the United States and much of Europe and beyond.\u201d",
      "Geopolitics",
      "Whether Leo likes it or not, the new leader of 1.4 billion Catholics will become a leading voice in an upended world. Francis chose to use that platform to pontificate against the war in the Gaza Strip, for example, and even rebuked President Donald Trump\u2019s stance on immigration.",
      "The next pope can choose to continue these fulminations, or not. But even a less outspoken pope would be notable by his absence on the world stage.",
      "\u201cFrancis has been a beacon of hope in the world, probably the only ethical helm in the (sinking) ship of global politics,\u201d said Sara Silvestri, a senior lecturer in international politics at City St. George\u2019s, University of London, in an email.",
      "She hoped the new pope wouldn\u2019t \u201cfall in the trap of siding with\u201d any one political faction, but rather \u201cbypass this by emphasizing the universality of the Christian message, and its core values of justice and mercy that are non negotiable and cannot fit into the narrow box of a political party or political ideology.\u201d",
      "Geography",
      "A key element of how the new pontiff navigates these roiling waters will be his approach to the rapidly changing demographics of the church.",
      "Europe\u2019s Catholic population fell by nearly half a million in 2022, according to the Vatican\u2019s most recent figures, released late last year. Meanwhile, the Catholic population grew by 7.3 million in Africa, 5.9 million in North and South America, and about 900,000 in Asia.",
      "The number of priests tracks the European decline and rise elsewhere, the figures show.",
      "So a big issue for the new pope will be how to address the needs of a church whose followers are increasingly based in the Global South.",
      "\u201cWe need a pope who understands the issues facing the Third World,\u201d Piere Domerson, a priest from Haiti who is studying in Rome, told NBC News shortly before Leo\u2019s election was announced.",
      "\u201cWe always remember how Pope Francis understood this universality of the church,\u201d he said in St. Peter\u2019s Square. \u201cAnd because he appointed more cardinals from outside Europe, we have seen that become more universal, too.\u201d",
      "N\u00e9stor Medina, a professor of religious ethics and culture at the University of Toronto, said people in the Global South are \u201cbecoming more actively vocal about the church\u2019s involvement with colonization.\u201d",
      "That means if the new pope wants \u201cto keep people in the church, then social justice, ecology and critique of capitalism will still have to be front and center of the new papacy,\u201d he said.",
      "Managing these changing currents will not be straightforward \u2014 the developing world is not a monolith. While many progressive Catholic voices have come from Latin America, a number of African bishops, also for example, can be among the most conservative when it comes to same-sex couples, divorce and cohabiting outside of marriage."

      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised tests of short-range ballistic missile systems that simulated nuclear counterstrikes against U.S. and South Korean forces, state media said Friday, as the North continued to blame its rivals for escalating tensions through their joint military exercises.",
      "The report came a day after South Korea\u2019s military detected multiple launches from North Korea\u2019s eastern coast and assessed that the tests could also be related to the country\u2019s weapons exports to Russia during its war in Ukraine.",
      "North Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said Thursday\u2019s tests involved a mobile ballistic missile system apparently modeled after Russia\u2019s Iskander, as well as 600-millimeter multiple rocket launchers that South Korean officials classify as ballistic due to their self-propulsion and guided flight. Both are part of a growing lineup of weapons systems that the North says could be armed with \u201ctactical\u201d nuclear weapons for battlefield use.",
      "KCNA said the tests were intended to train military units operating missile and rocket systems to more effectively execute attacks under the North\u2019s nuclear weapons control system and ensure a swift response to a nuclear crisis.",
      "The agency criticized the United States and its \u201cvassal states\u201d for expanding joint military exercises on and around the Korean Peninsula, which the North claims are preparations for nuclear war, and said Thursday\u2019s launches demonstrated the \u201crapid counteraction posture\u201d of its forces.",
      "Kim stressed the need to strengthen the role of his nuclear forces in both deterring and fighting war, and called for continued efforts to improve combat readiness and precision strike capabilities, KCNA said.",
      "Kim Inae, spokesperson for South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, described the latest North Korean launches as a \u201cclear act of provocation\u201d that violates U.N. Security Council resolutions and poses a serious threat to peace and stability in the region.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said multiple missiles of various types were launched from the area around the eastern port city of Wonsan on Thursday from about 8:10 to 9:20 a.m. (7:10 to 8:20 p.m. Wednesday ET), with the farthest traveling about 500 miles.",
      "Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson for the Joint Chiefs, said in a briefing that the North Korean launches were possibly intended to test the performance of weapons it plans to export, as the country continues to send military equipment and troops to fuel Russia\u2019s warfighting against Ukraine.",
      "Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani told reporters that none of the North Korean missiles reached Japan\u2019s exclusive economic zone and there was no damage to vessels or aircraft in the area.",
      "It was the North\u2019s first known ballistic activity since March 10, when it fired several ballistic missiles hours after U.S. and South Korean troops began an annual combined military exercise, and the country\u2019s sixth launch event of the year.",
      "Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have escalated in recent months as North Korean leader Kim continues to accelerate the development of his nuclear and missile programs and supply weapons and troops to support Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "Thursday\u2019s launch came a day after North Korean state media said Kim urged munition workers to increase the production of artillery shells amid his deepening alignment with Moscow."

      "The new pope's online footprint was quickly dissected Thursday just minutes after he was elected the next head of the Catholic Church, sparking a mixed reaction from some on the right.",
      "Before he became Pope Leo XIV, Cardinal Robert Prevost occasionally posted on social media, including some messages that appeared to be critical of President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance and their worldview.",
      "His most recent activity on X came in mid-April, when he shared a post on his account from a Catholic commentator who called out Trump and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele for laughing about the deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia of Maryland. The post linked to an article published by the Catholic Standard newspaper, in which Bishop Evelio Menjivar asked of Catholics about Abrego Garcia: \u201cIs your conscience not disturbed? How can you stay quiet?\u201d",
      "In February, Prevost posted links to stories that were critical of Vance, including one from the National Catholic Reporter. Prevost repeated the headline on X: \u201cJD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn\u2019t ask us to rank our love for others.\" In the article, the writer rebutted Vance\u2019s claim in a Fox News interview that Christians prioritize loving people close to them before those from other countries.",
      "Reached for comment Thursday, the White House directed NBC News to a post on X by Vance.",
      "Vance, who converted to Catholicism in 2019 and happened to meet with Pope Francis the day before he died, congratulated Prevost on being elected the first American pope.",
      "\"I\u2019m sure millions of American Catholics and other Christians will pray for his successful work leading the Church. May God bless him!\u201d he wrote on X.",

      "\u201cWhat excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!\u201d",
      "Other reposts from Prevost's X account have suggested he supports protecting immigrants, reducing gun violence and combating climate change.",
      "The day after the Las Vegas mass shooting in October 2017, Prevost shared a post from Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., that said: \"To my colleagues: your cowardice to act cannot be whitewashed by thoughts and prayers. None of this ends unless we do something to stop it.\"",
      "Also in 2017, Prevost reposted someone who was defending immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children, known as Dreamers.",
      "\"I stand with the #Dreamers and all people who are working toward an immigration system that is fair, just, and moral. #DefendDACA #DACA,\" the post said.",
      "In a matter of hours, his X account had added more than 200,000 followers.",
      "Still, the new pope has not been a prolific poster \u2014 and much of what he shared was fairly standard Catholic fare \u2014 so his social media posts don't give a complete picture of all his political views.",
      "Some conservative commentators have already seized on Prevost's posts and comments.",
      "Laura Loomer, a far-right commentator and close Trump ally, published a series of posts decrying Leo\u2019s politics. \u201cJust another Marxist puppet in the Vatican,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk was more neutral in his reaction to Prevost's election.",
      "\"Let\u2019s just say, not so great tweets about having some willingness for open borders. We\u2019ll see kind of how he is on that. Also some George Floyd stuff that I\u2019m not too crazy about,\" he said in a video on X. \"But overall, it seems like he\u2019s a pro-life warrior. There\u2019s a lot yet to learn about this pope, but I hope that he will be a strong advocate for strong borders. And for sovereignty.\u201d",
      "In 2020, Prevost reposted tweets offering prayers and a message of support for Floyd, whose murder by a Minneapolis police officer led to a national reckoning on race relations and policing.",
      "Other Republicans, like former President George W. Bush, had more positive reactions. Bush said in a statement that it's a \"historic and hopeful moment for Catholics in America and for the faithful around the world.\"",
      "Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat and only the second Catholic to be elected to the White House, also voiced support for the new pope on X: \"Habemus papam \u2014 May God bless Pope Leo XIV of Illinois. Jill and I congratulate him and wish him success.\""
