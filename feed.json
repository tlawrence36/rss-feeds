      "Hundreds of additional visitors came to the Hessische Landesmuseum in central Germany over the weekend to admire the painting, with one family traveling from the northern city of Hamburg especially for the occasion, museum spokesperson Susanne Hirschmann told German news agency dpa on Wednesday.

      "Heyser\u2019s oil-on-canvas painting presents the figure of Ophelia clad in white and surrounded by white water lilies. The painting\u2019s exact year of creation is not known but experts believe it dates back to around 1900.",
      "In the opening scene of the video for the hit song \u201cThe Fate of Ophelia,\u201d Swift slips into the role of Ophelia and becomes a living painting.",

      "Can one documentary encapsulate the life of Martin Scorsese",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The first time the filmmaker Rebecca Miller met Martin Scorsese was on the set of 2002's \u201cGangs of New York.\u201d Miller\u2019s husband, Daniel Day-Lewis, was starring in it. There, Miller found an anxious Scorsese on the precipice of the film\u2019s enormous fight scene, shot on a sprawling set.",
      "\u201cHe seemed like a young man, hoping that he had chosen the right way to shoot a massive scene,\u201d Miller recalls. \u201cI was stunned by how youthful and alive he was.\u201d",
      "That remains much the same throughout Miller\u2019s expansive and stirring documentary portrait of the endlessly energetic and singularly essential filmmaker. In \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d which premieres Friday on Apple TV, Miller captures the life and career of Scorsese, whose films have made one of the greatest sustained arguments for the power of cinema.",
      "\u201cWe talk about 32 films, which is a lot of films. But there are yet more films,\u201d Miller says, referencing Scorsese\u2019s projects to come. \u201cIt\u2019s a life that overspills its own bounds. You think you\u2019ve got it, and then it\u2019s more and more and more.\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s life has long had a mythic arc: The asthmatic kid from Little Italy who grew up watching old movies on television and went on to make some of the defining New York films. That\u2019s a part of \u201cMr. Scorsese,\u201d too, but Miller\u2019s film, culled from 20 hours of interviews with Scorsese over five years, is a more intimate, reflective and often funny conversation about the compulsions that drove him and the abiding questions \u2014 of morality, faith and filmmaking \u2014 that have guided him.",
      "\u201cWho are we? What are we, I should say?\u201d Scorsese says in the opening moments of the series. \u201cAre we intrinsically good or evil?\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the struggle,\u201d he adds. \u201cI struggle with it all the time.\u201d",
      "Miller began interviewing Scorsese during the pandemic. He was then beginning to make \u201cKillers of the Flower Moon.\u201d Their first meetings were outside. Miller first pitched the idea to Scorsese as a multifaceted portrait. Then, she imagined a two-hour documentary. Later, by necessity, it turned into a five-hour series. It still feels too short.",
      "\u201cI explained I wanted to take a cubist approach, with different shafts of light on him from all different perspectives \u2014 collaborators, family,\u201d Miller says. \u201cWithin a very short amount of time, he sort of began talking as if we were doing it. I was a bit confused, thinking, \u2018Is this a job interview or a planning situation?\u2019\u201d",
      "Scorsese\u2019s own documentaries have often been some of the most insightful windows into him. In one of his earliest films, \u201cItalianamerican\u201d (1974), he interviewed his parents. His surveys of cinema, including 1995\u2019s \u201cA Personal Journey With Martin Scorsese Through American Movies\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMy Voyage to Italy,\u201d have been especially revealing of the inspirations that formed him. Scorsese has never penned a memoir, but these movies come close.",
      "While the bulk of \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d are the director\u2019s own film-to-film recollections, a wealth of other personalities color in the portrait. That includes collaborators like editor Thelma Schoonmaker, Paul Schrader, Robert De Niro, Leonardo DiCaprio and Day-Lewis. It also includes Scorsese\u2019s children, his ex-wives and his old Little Italy pals. One, Salvatore \u201cSally Gaga\u201d Uricola for the first time is revealed as the model for De Niro\u2019s troublemaking, mailbox-blowing-up Johnny Boy in \u201cMean Streets.\u201d",

      "It can be easy to think of Scorsese, perhaps the most revered living filmmaker, as an inevitability, that of course he gets to make the films he wants. But \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d is a reminder how often that wasn\u2019t the case and how frequently Scorsese found himself on the outside of Hollywood, whether due to box-office disappointment, a clash of style or the perceived danger in controversial subjects (\u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ\u201d) he was drawn to.",
      "\u201cHe was fighting for every single film,\u201d Miller says. \u201cCutting this whole thing was like riding a bucking bronco. You\u2019re up and you\u2019re down, you\u2019re dead, then alive.\u201d",
      "Film executives today, an especially risk-averse lot, could learn some lessons from \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d in what a difference they can make for a personal filmmaker. As discussed in the film, in the late \u201970s, producer Irwin Winkler refused to do \u201cRocky II\u201d with United Artists unless they also made \u201cRaging Bull.\u201d",
      "For Miller, whose films include \u201cThe Ballad of Jack and Rose\u201d and \u201cMaggie\u2019s Plan,\u201d being around Scorsese was an education. She found his films began to infect \u201cMr. Scorsese.\u201d The cutting of the documentary took on the style of his film\u2019s editing. \u201cIn proximity to these film,\u201d she says, \u201cyou start to breathe the air.\u201d",
      "Nearness to Scorsese also inevitably means movie recommendations. Lots of them. One that stood out for Miller was \u201cThe Insect Woman,\u201d Japanese filmmaker Sh\u014dhei Imamura\u2019s 1963 drama about three generations of women.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still doing it,\u201d Miller says. \u201cHe\u2019s still sending me movies.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d recently debuted at the New York Film Festival, where Miller's son, Ronan Day-Lewis made his directorial debut with \u201cAnemone,\u201d a film that marked her husband's return from retirement. At the \u201cMr. Scorsese\u201d premiere, a packed audience at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall came to enthusiastically revel in, and pay tribute to its subject.",
      "\u201cYou hear all those people laughing with him or suddenly bursting into applause when they see Thelma Schoonmaker or at the end of the \u2018Last Waltz\u2019 sequence,\u201d Miller says. \u201cThere was a sense of such palpable enthusiasm and love. My husband said something I thought was very beautiful: It reminded everyone of how much they love him.\u201d",

      "Richard Linklater likes to joke that if he and Ethan Hawke didn\u2019t know each other so well, Hawke probably would have punched him during the making of \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d",
      "The two Texans have been friends and collaborators for over 30 years. They had made eight films together when they started \u201cBlue Moon,\u201d about the lyricist Lorenz Hart set over one night at Sardi\u2019s restaurant. It\u2019s a project they\u2019d been talking about for over a decade.",
      "One might assume that it would be all old hat between them. And yet this was a film, in select theaters Friday, that would require a vastly different dynamic.",
      "\u201cI was nagging. I was riding his (expletive). It\u2019s not the way I work usually,\u201d Linklater said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cThe film\u2019s small in scale. It seems minimalistic. But what was incumbent on Ethan was pretty massive.\u201d",
      "That punching thing, Hawke said in a separate interview, was completely true. He came to realize that Linklater was channeling his inner Sidney Lumet \u2014 a great actors\u2019 director, but a tough one.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking to me. He didn\u2019t want us to take the work for granted, or that we were friends,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cHe\u2019s been listening to me talk about acting for 30 years and he wanted to give me a chance to really do it. To stop talking about it and do it.\u201d",
      "Hawke has never shied away from a challenge. When they were making \u201cBefore Sunrise\u201d in Vienna in 1994, Linklater remembered Hawke looking at the script and saying \u201cthis probably won\u2019t work\u201d but diving into it anyway. That\u2019s when he was sure he had found a kindred spirit, someone who ran towards the impossible.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be in that territory if you want to do anything that\u2019s different, something someone hasn\u2019t seen before,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to feel like you\u2019re out on some limb going, \u2018We\u2019re risking a huge whopping failure.\u2019\u201d",
      "But Lorenz Hart was not Jesse the writer in the \u201cBefore\u201d movies. Here was a man who was both small in stature (the most generous reports say he was 5-foot-2-inches), balding, extremely self-conscious about his appearance and the biggest personality and wit in the room. He was a genius and an alcoholic who had made himself unemployable. And amid all of this, the times were changing, and he was being left behind.",
      "Every couple of years over the last decade, they would get together and do a reading of the script. Hawke loved the character and felt deeply that he was the right person to do it, but when it came time to take it out of the theoretical, he said, \u201cit got very scary.\u201d During the first couple of days of rehearsal, Hawke got terribly sick.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like my body knew this was about to be something really stressful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe event of the movie is Lorenz Hart and everybody\u2019s actually supporting this portrait.\u201d",
      "That included himself and his ego. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d would require a deconstruction, and disappearance of the movie star that is Ethan Hawke.",
      "The script from author Robert Kaplow takes audiences inside the famed Broadway theater district restaurant Sardi\u2019s on the opening night of \u201cOklahoma!\u201d in 1943. Hart is holding court with a bartender (Bobby Cannavale) waiting for his old collaborator Richard Rodgers (Andrew Scott) to come to the party.",
      "For over 20 years Rodgers and Hart were a prolific and successful songwriting team, behind musical hits and hundreds of classic songs, including \u201cMy Funny Valentine,\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t It Romantic?\u201d \u201cThe Lady is a Tramp\u201d and \u201cBlue Moon.\u201d It\u2019s one of the great artistic partnerships of all time.

      "\u201cThe country is changing, and the jazz era is ending and a new era is beginning and one of these people is going to continue on to lead and the other is going to be completely left behind,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cAnd the fact that he\u2019s so funny in the face of tragedy? That\u2019s where the screenplay really shines: The duality of this man. He\u2019s both absurdly jealous and simultaneously very supportive and loving. He\u2019s wickedly funny and suicidal. He\u2019s a homosexual in love with a woman. The correlation of opposites, that is Larry Hart.\u201d",
      "The production used old school Hollywood tricks to make the 5-foot-10-inch Hawke look tiny on a micro budget. He shaved his head to get that balding look. And they built a Sardi\u2019s set in Ireland.",
      "\u201cI always describe it as this little howl into the night of an artist being left behind. It\u2019s to live through your own extinction,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI hope people respond to it the way you would a beautiful Rodgers and Hart song. It\u2019s lyrical, it\u2019s beautiful in a way, but it leaves you kind of devastated.\u201d",
      "Making a life in the arts requires immense sacrifice no matter how you look at it. And there\u2019s always the possibility that the culture will pass you by. Hawke, for one, said he\u2019s had three distinct moments in his career where he was pretty sure he was washed up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way you could do this for over 30 years and not feel it,\u201d Hawke said. \u201cThey come on like waves and you have to try to survive.\u201d",
      "The experience made him think of a lot of the people he came up with, who mentored him when he was starting out in the theater in the 1980s. Many of them, like Hart, were closeted, and they viewed their vocation not as a job but as a kind of spiritual calling. One stage actor he was thinking a lot about was the late Richard Easton, who he did a few plays with before he passed.",
      "\u201cWhen I was young, he said to me, \u2018One lifetime is not enough. It\u2019s not enough time to learn what you need to learn to be the kind of actor that you dream of being,\u2019\u201d Hawke said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great attitude. It creates a perpetual sense of learning and an ongoing process, and this part really did require everything that I\u2019d learned up until now.\u201d",
      "\u201cBlue Moon\u201d is actually one of two Linklater movies about artists that will be in theaters this month. \u201cNovelle Vague\u201d (out Oct. 31), about the making of Jean-Luc Godard\u2019s \u201cBreathless,\u201d is about the beginnings of a career. \u201cBlue Moon\u201d is about the end of one.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a poignancy to art careers,\u201d Linklater said. \u201cI think we all think we\u2019re just going to run the table and do this until the day we die. But things get in the way.\u201d",
      "One thing we don\u2019t have to worry about (yet) is a creative breakup between Linklater and Hawke. Linklater might have given his friend some tough love, but they never argued, and in the end it was worth it. Hawke lived up to the challenge and no one got punched.",

      "Diane Keaton has always stood out in Hollywood",
      "Diane Keaton never really played the part of glamorous movie star. She was in iconic films and she dated some of the biggest stars of her generation, and yet she somehow remained other and defiantly herself despite so many years working in the Hollywood system. Eccentric and approachable, with a sort of effervescent charm, it\u2019s no surprise that she played muse to so many, from Woody Allen to Nancy Meyers.",
      "People often describe her as self-deprecating, as if it was a choice and not a product of deep-seated insecurity. Keaton was someone who thought herself ugly, who battled eating disorders and who never seemed to give herself enough credit for her successes. But she was also able to channel that into her performances spanning five decades unlike none other.",
      "There are so many Keaton films worth noting, including her full run with Allen. There are the Instagram favorites like \u201cThe First Wives Club\u201d (available to rent), nostalgic classics like \u201cFather of the Bride\u201d (streaming on Hulu) and dramatic turns in \u201cMarvin\u2019s Room\u201d (streaming on Kanopy) and \u201cShoot the Moon\u201d (available to rent).",
      "Here are six essential roles to get you started.",
      "Kay Adams, the future Mrs. Corleone, could have been a wallpaper role. But Keaton, in her breakout role, held the screen next to her flashier counterparts. She was the wife who had something going on behind her eyes, who could hold the screen in the chilling final shot of the first film. Social media doesn\u2019t often produce anything worthwhile but in 2023 Francis Ford Coppola and Keaton had an exchange on an Instagram story \u201cask me anything\u201d session. She wondered why he\u2019d picked her.",
      "\u201cI chose you, because although you were to play the more straight/vanilla wife, there was something more about you, deeper, funnier, and very interesting. (I was right),\u201d Coppola wrote.",

      "\u201cLa-dee-da, la-dee-da\u201d where to even begin with \u201cAnnie Hall?\u201d It is the quintessential Keaton role, a love-letter to her quirks, eccentricities, insecurities and charm all wrapped up in this fictional tie-wearing WASP from Chippewa Falls.",
      "Allen encouraged her to wear what she wanted to wear, and so she assembled her iconic outfit \u2014 khaki pants, vest, tie \u2014 from \u201ccool-looking women on the streets of New York.\u201d The hat was lifted from actor Aurore Clement.",
      "\u201cNo one had any serious expectations. We were just having a good time moving through New York\u2019s landmark locations,\u201d she wrote in her memoir. \u201cAs always, Woody concerned himself with worries about the script.

Keaton plays this brilliant playwright who catches the eye of both an older playboy (Jack Nicholson) with a proclivity for much younger women and a young, handsome doctor (Keanu Reeves). Keaton has called it her favorite movie, in part because she got to kiss Nicholson (who she had acted alongside before, in \u201cReds\u201d) \u201cbecause it was so unexpected at age 57.\u201d",

      "GABES, Tunisia -- GABES, Tunisia (AP) \u2014 Police rained tear gas on crowds and several demonstrators and riot police were injured in the southern Tunisian city of Gabes as thousands of people marched Wednesday to protest worsening air pollution from a phosphate-processing plant.",
      "The protest descended into clashes with police who attempted to disperse protesters trying to reach the plant in an industrial complex, which is a designated military zone. Gabes, home to more than 400,000 residents, lies at the heart of Tunisia\u2019s phosphate industry, one of the key sources of export revenue for the North African country.",
      "Wednesday's protests were the latest since a gas leak near the state-owned Chemical Group of Tunisia industrial complex. The leak sent dozens of residents, including children, to hospitals in recent weeks, according to environmental activist group \u201cStop Pollution.\u201d",
      "The leak reignited long-standing anger in the coastal city, where residents blame more than five decades of industrial activity for rising cancer rates, respiratory illnesses and the collapse of the region\u2019s once-thriving and unique ecosystem.",
      "By nightfall Wednesday, plumes of tear gas, burning tires and trash bins filled the streets as protesters blocked major roads and chanted against what they called \u201cenvironmental crimes.\u201d Many demanded the dissolution of the GCT and closure of its phosphate units, which they accused of slowly poisoning Gabes.",
      "The city\u2019s chemical complex processes raw phosphate into fertilizer, an operation that for decades has discharged toxic waste directly into the Gulf of Gabes. Environmental groups say the pollution has wiped out marine life, turned the waters dark and forced generations of fishermen out of work.",
      "Successive Tunisian governments have promised to relocate or modernize the plant, but environmental activists say those pledges have repeatedly gone unfulfilled.",
      "Tunisia\u2019s National Observatory for Agriculture has repeatedly warned air quality in parts of Gabes exceeds limits set by the World Health Organization. Environmental experts repeatedly noted the persistent high levels of sulfur dioxide and ammonia in the atmosphere, pollutants known to cause respiratory damage and contribute to acid rain.",

      "In the wake of massive U.S. cuts to foreign aid, the tiny country of Lesotho in southern Africa faces deep uncertainty and worry over its HIV-positive residents",
      "HA LEJONE, Lesotho -- HA LEJONE, Lesotho (AP) \u2014 In the snow-topped mountains of Lesotho, mothers carrying babies on their backs walk for hours to the nearest health clinic, only to find HIV testing isn\u2019t available. Centers catering to the most vulnerable are shutting their doors. Health workers have been laid off in droves. Desperate patients ration or share pills.",
      "This Lesotho was unimaginable months ago, residents, health workers and experts say. The small landlocked nation in southern Africa long had the world\u2019s second-highest rate of HIV infections. But over years, with nearly $1 billion in aid from the United States, Lesotho patched together a health network efficient enough to slow the spread of the epidemic, one of the deadliest in modern history.",
      "Then, on Jan. 20, the first day of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, he signed an executive order freezing foreign aid. Within weeks, Trump had slashed overseas assistance and dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development. Confusion followed in nearly all the 130 countries with USAID-supported programs. Nine months later in Lesotho, there\u2019s still little clarity.",
      "With the single stroke of a distant president\u2019s pen, much of a system credited with saving hundreds of thousands of lives was dismantled.",
      "Weeks ago, the U.S. announced it would reinstate some of its flagship initiatives to combat HIV worldwide. Officials here applauded the move. But the measures are temporary solutions that stress countries must move toward autonomy in public health.",
      "The State Department told The Associated Press in an email that its six-month bridge programs would ensure continuity of lifesaving programs \u2014 including testing and medication, and initiatives addressing mother-to-child transmission \u2014 while officials work with Lesotho on a multiyear agreement on funding.",
      "Those negotiations will likely take months, and while programs may have been reinstated on paper, restarting them on the ground takes considerable time, Lesotho health workers and experts told AP.",
      "HIV-positive residents, families and caregivers say the chaos that reigned most of this year has caused irreparable harm, and they\u2019re consumed with worry and uncertainty about the future. Most feel deep disappointment \u2014 even betrayal \u2014 over the loss of funds and support.",
      "\u201cEveryone who is HIV-positive in Lesotho is a dead man walking,\u201d said Hlaoli Monyamane, a 32-year-old miner who couldn\u2019t get a sufficient medication supply to support him while working in neighboring South Africa.",
      "HIV prevention programs \u2013 targeting mother-to-child transmission, encouraging male circumcision, and working with high-risk groups including sex workers and miners \u2014 were cut off. Unpaid nurses and other workers decided to use informal networks to reach isolated communities. Labs shuttered, and public clinics grew overwhelmed. Patients began abandoning treatment or rationing pills.",
      "Experts with UNAIDS \u2014 the U.N. agency tasked with fighting the virus globally \u2014 warned in July that up to 4 million people worldwide would die if funding weren\u2019t reinstated. And Lesotho health officials said the cuts would lead to increased HIV transmission, more deaths and higher health costs.",
      "Calculating how many lives are lost or affected is a massive task, and those responsible for tracking and adding data to a centralized system were largely let go.",
      "Lesotho Health Secretary Maneo Moliehi Ntene and HIV/AIDS program manager Dr. Tapiwa Tarumbiswa declined repeated requests to be interviewed or comment about the aid cuts. But Mokhothu Makhalanyane, chairperson of Lesotho\u2019s legislative health committee, said the impact is huge, estimating the country was set back at least 15 years in its HIV work.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a lot of lives because of this,\u201d he said.",
      "Lesotho reached a milestone late last year \u2014 UNAIDS\u2019s 95-95-95 goal, with 95% of people living with HIV aware of their status, 95% of those in treatment, and 95% of those with a suppressed viral load. Still, the nation must care for the estimated 260,000 of its 2.3 million residents who are HIV-positive.",
      "Overall, Lesotho and even global HIV efforts accounted for small parts of the United States\u2019 massive international aid efforts. USAID spent tens of billions of dollars annually. Its dismantling has rocked the lives of millions of people in low- and middle-income nations around the world.",
      "For many in this mountainous country and elsewhere, a positive HIV test 20 years ago was akin to a death sentence. If untreated, most people with HIV develop AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. At the height of the epidemic in 2004, more than 2 million people died of AIDS-related illness worldwide \u2014 19,000 in Lesotho, UNAIDS estimated.",
      "In 2003, the U.S. launched the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. PEPFAR became the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease, and its main implementing partner was USAID. PEPFAR became so important and well known in Lesotho and other countries that health professionals and residents use the term as shorthand to refer to any HIV aid.",
      "When foreign assistance was frozen, Lesotho lost at least 23% of PEPFAR money, putting it in the top 10 countries for share of such funding cut, according to the Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Mapapali Mosoeunyane is among Lesotho residents who credit PEPFAR with helping save them. After learning she had the virus in 2009, she was certain dying was just a matter of time. Neighbors gossiped, she was fired, and she considered giving up her two young sons for adoption.",
      "But around 2013, she got access to antiretroviral medication \u2014 which suppresses HIV levels in the blood, with the potential to bring it to undetectable levels. In 2016, Lesotho was the first African country to \u201ctest and treat all\u201d \u2014 everyone who tested positive was prescribed ARVs. That work, officials say, was possible because of PEPFAR.",
      "Today, 62-year-old Mosoeunyane leads a peer support group in her village, Ha Koloboi. Neighbors ask for advice and trust her with their green medical booklets, where they record medical history, viral load, symptoms and medications.",
      "Lately, the group mostly worries \u2014 about the future, losing medication access, getting sick again.",
      "\u201cThis has been the most difficult time for me,\u201d Mosoeunyane said.",
      "Many in Mosoeunyane\u2019s group wish Trump himself could hear their concerns. \u201cTrump\u2019s decision is already translating into real life,\u201d said Mateboho Talitha Fusi, Mosoeunyane\u2019s friend and neighbor.",
      "The worries span Lesotho society: from rural to urban, low to middle income, patients to officials. Many Basotho \u2013 as people in Lesotho are known \u2013 feel hopeless.",
      "When Trump dissolved USAID, Lesotho leaders said they tried to talk to U.S. officials, even through their South African neighbors after failing to connect directly. But, they said, they got more information from news reports.",
      "For Lisebo Lechela, a 53-year-old sex worker turned HIV activist and health worker, the news was fast and blunt. Days after Trump\u2019s order, she was about to distribute medication, but a call from her boss interrupted her.",
      "\u201cStop work immediately,\u201d she was told.",
      "Lechela\u2019s organization, the USAID-funded Phelisanang Bophelong HIV/AIDS network, had drop-in centers at gas stations where sex workers could seek services. Workers set up tents outside bars with condoms and the prevention medication known as PreP. Teams delivered medication directly to patients who wouldn\u2019t step foot in public health clinics, for fear of discrimination.",
      "Lechela\u2019s group earned the trust of the skeptics and the stubborn. All that work is gone, she fears. She still gets calls from people desperate for services and refills. She does what she can, and their stories haunt her.",
      "Among them is a textile factory worker who turned to sex work at night to support her three children. She used to take PrEP and isn\u2019t sure how she\u2019ll protect herself. Most clients won\u2019t use condoms, she said, some turning violent if sex workers insist.",
      "\u201cI have to put bread on the table,\u201d said the woman, speaking on condition of anonymity because her husband, who works in South Africa, wouldn\u2019t approve of her sex work. She can\u2019t miss a day of factory work to wait in line at a clinic.",
      "Visiting the woman at home, all Lechela could do was demonstrate how to use a female condom \u2013 and hope her clients wouldn\u2019t notice or protest.",
      "With nearly all community groups and local organizations like Lechela\u2019s closed and 1,500 health workers fired, some Lesotho officials see overdue signs that their nation and others must stop relying on international aid.",

      "\u201cLesotho\u2019s made progress one should not overlook; at the same time, it is still a heavily burdened country with HIV.\u201d",

She also applauded U.S. efforts to buy doses of a twice-a-year HIV prevention shot and prioritize them for pregnant and breastfeeding women in low- to middle-income countries, including Lesotho, via PEPFAR.",

      "But it\u2019s not clear how much the U.S. bridge programs will \u201cclose the gap,\u201d added Chikukwa, even as she\u2019s leaving Lesotho. Her role was eliminated because of the aid cuts. The South Africa UNAIDS office will oversee Lesotho, she said, but she wasn\u2019t sure where she\u2019d be reassigned.",
      "In its email to AP, the State Department said Secretary Marco Rubio had approved lifesaving PEPFAR programs and urged implementers to resume their work. The email emphasized that officials will work with Lesotho to continue providing health foreign assistance, but didn't give specifics about the amount of funding.",
      "Lesotho funded only 12% of its own health budget. The U.S. and other foreign donors provided the rest. USAID alone accounted for 34% of the budget; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 26%, according to a May presentation to lawmakers.",
      "Health committee chair Makhalanyane said this month that it remains unclear how much U.S. aid is being reinstated, even if temporarily. There had been only verbal promises, nothing in writing, he noted, and hundreds of health workers who had been promised they\u2019d be absorbed by the national health system remain unemployed.",
      "Unlike other PEPFAR-supported countries, Lesotho funded medication for 80% of its HIV patients \u2014 a figure officials tout as they try to move toward a self-sustaining system. Still, the aid cuts sparked panic over supply and distribution.",
      "Lesotho regularly gave patients a six- to 12-month supply to help its mobile population, including many who work in South Africa, stick with treatment. But when the cuts were announced, some nurses gave out even more drugs than usual.",
      "Nurses were told to cut back. Patients grew alarmed.",
      "Miner Monyamane said he got a three-month supply, not his usual 12. So instead of continuing to work in South Africa, he decided to remain in his small village of Thaba-Tsoeu Ha Mafa. Like many miners, he chose his health over a job and steady paycheck. He fears diseases such as tuberculosis \u2014 a leading cause of death in Lesotho, attributed to weakened immune systems \u2014 may creep up on him if he interrupts treatment.",

      "Since 2008, Connor\u2019s group received more than $227 million from the U.S. for Lesotho programming, USASpending.gov data shows. This fiscal year, about half the work it planned has been terminated.",

      "It's not clear exactly what may be driving the apparent improvements in obesity. Wider use of drugs such as Wegovy and Zepbound \u2014 which target appetite and slow digestion \u2014 could be starting to show up in reported data, said Aviva Musicus, a science director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group. Increased support for nutrition assistance programs during the COVID-19 pandemic might also be a factor, she suggested.",
      "The report also details a broad range of federal, state and local efforts that focus on improving nutrition and boosting physical activity, said Solveig Cunningham, an Emory University global health expert who specializes in obesity.",
      "\u201cI think the report would argue that some of these interventions may actually be successful,\u201d said Cunningham, who was not involved with the research. \u201cThat would suggest that there are possibly ways in which we could prevent obesity at the population level, which would be a really, really big deal.\u201d",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa's health minister on Tuesday called lenacapavir, the first twice-yearly HIV prevention jab in the world, a \u201cgroundbreaking\u201d tool to fight the disease, but warned initial donated supply would be limited to nearly half a million people in the African country with the highest prevalence rate.",
      "This comes just weeks after the U.S. announced plans to buy 2 million doses of the HIV prevention drug for low-income countries.",
      "The initial supply in South Africa is set to begin in April 2026, funded by a $29.2 million Global Fund grant with an additional $5 million allocated by the Networking HIV and AIDS Community of Southern Africa (NACOSA).",
      "Addressing a national healthcare roundtable dialogue in Johannesburg, Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said the Global Funds\u2019 catalytic commitment will deliver around 456,000 lenacapavir initiations over two years, translating into 912,000 doses.",
      "\u201cWe plan to roll out lenacapavir initially in about 23 high-incident districts across six provinces, targeting around 360 high-performing public clinics within these areas for phase one implementation,\u201d said the minister.",
      "\u201cAbout half a million people will be able to begin using lenacapavir, and thanks to this support, but demand will likely outstrip supply at first,\u201d said Motsoaledi, highlighting that research data suggested that prioritizing vulnerable populations in high-burden districts first would result in the highest impact in terms of new infections prevented.",
      "The minister was quick to caution against complacency with the initial investment after South Africa\u2019s health system was significantly hit by the abrupt cuts to funding from USAID and other U.S. government sources in early 2025. These cuts have had a severe impact on HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis (TB) treatment, prevention, and research programs across the country.",
      "Although Motsoaledi expressed gratitude that Gilead had lowered the price from the $28,000, initially touted to $40, per person annually, he said that South Africa aimed to fund its program independently, with long-term funding hinging on lenacapavir\u2019s integration into local systems, such as the essential medicines list.",
      "The World Health Organization in July recommended the six-month HIV prevention jab that\u2019s already approved in the U.S. and Europe, as an additional prevention choice as part of combination approaches. Gilead is expediting registration in 18 high-incidence countries, including South Africa, to deliver lenacapavir until generic versions become available in 2027.",
      "Early in October, Gilead Sciences announced it had executed voluntary, non-exclusive, royalty-free license contracts with six pharmaceutical companies in Egypt, Pakistan, and India to produce and market generic lenacapavir. Despite participating in the clinical trials for the drug in recent years, South African companies were excluded from Gilead Sciences\u2019 voluntary licensing, which has infuriated civil society.",

      "Fewer choices may be on the menu again as Medicare patients shop for prescription coverage this fall.",
      "The number of available, stand-alone drug plans has fallen for a few years, and that trend will continue for 2026. Most markets will still have several choices, but some options are becoming particularly sparse for shoppers with low-income subsidies. And help may be harder to find because some insurers no longer pay brokers commissions for new business.",
      "Shoppers have from Oct. 15 to Dec. 7 to find new coverage that starts in January.",
      "Some things to consider:",
      "Regular Medicare, which most people qualify for after turning 65, does not come with prescription coverage, known as Part D. People must choose that separately.",
      "About 23 million people with regular Medicare have this standalone coverage, according to the non-profit KFF, which studies health care.",
      "Another roughly 34 million people have Medicare Advantage plans, which are privately run versions of Medicare that often come with prescription coverage.",
      "A typical shopper will be able to choose a standalone drug plan from among eight to 12 options for 2026, according to KFF Medicare expert Juliette Cubanski. That\u2019s down from 12 to 16 options in 2025.",
      "Shoppers had nearly 30 choices as recently as 2021, according to the Commonwealth Fund\u2019s Gretchen Jacobson.",
      "Depending on the state, a range of one to four plans will be available at no premium to people who qualify for low-income subsidies, according to KFF. Eight were available in 2021.",
      "Some insurers are reducing their presence in standalone Part D plans, while the Blue Cross-Blue Shield carrier Elevance is leaving the market entirely. Insurers and analysts who follow the industry note that the Inflation Reduction Act, which will cap annual out-of-pocket drug costs at $2,100 in 2026, puts more financial pressure on insurers. The same law now allows patients to spread the cost of prescriptions over the year.",
      "Most markets will have several choices. But experts say Medicare Part D customers don\u2019t like to shop, especially if they already have a plan that covers their medications. Finding affordable coverage for multiple prescriptions can be tricky.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of inertia and, frankly, people may be concerned that if they switch, they\u2019re going to end up worse off,\u201d Cubanski said.",
      "More people are being pushed to shop. Nearly 11% of those with standalone prescription drug coverage lost their plan in 2024, according to research published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association.",
      "Before 2023, that figure was often under 1%, said Dr. Christopher Cai, one of the researchers involved in the study.",

      "But while plans may provide lower coverage prices, they could also raise deductibles or offer more limited lists of covered drugs, which are called formularies. Shoppers should check these details.",
      "Insurers will be allowed to raise premiums by as much as $50 a month for 2026, up from a $35 increase allowed this year. But Cubanski said only some plans will hit that higher limit and not necessarily in all states.",
      "Shoppers can use a federal government website to compare plan prices and coverage.",

      "\u201cIn the meantime, I will evaluate whether the conditions exist to request my client\u2019s release, since the legal basis for detention has ceased to exist,\u201d Canestrini added.",
      "The explosions ruptured the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, which carried Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea until Russia cut off supplies at the end of August 2022. They also damaged the parallel Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which never entered service because Germany suspended its certification process shortly before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "German prosecutors opened an investigation after the explosions and officials have pointed to an interest in clearing up what happened.",
      "Kuznietsov was detained on a European arrest warrant Aug. 21 at a campground near the Adriatic coastal city of Rimini, where he was vacationing with his family.",

      "JOHANNESBURG (AP) \u2014 South Africa on Thursday welcomed a U.S. bridging plan worth $115 million that would continue funding HIV treatment and prevention programs until the end of March, saying it was a sign of good bilateral relations despite recent tensions.",
      "The U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, has been credited with saving more than 25 million lives over two decades of people with HIV, the vast majority in Africa. South Africa has the highest number in the world of people living with HIV.",
      "In January, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order suspending all foreign aid for South Africa, including PEPFAR.",
      "While a temporary waiver was initially granted for the 90-day suspension, the US began terminating grants in late February 2025, and most funding remained frozen or stopped, leading to job losses and service disruptions.",
      "The U.S. previously contributed more than $400 million a year to South Africa\u2019s HIV programs and nongovernmental organizations, or about 17% of the total funding according to the health department.",
      "As a result of the funding freeze, more than 8,000 health workers were laid off and the 12 specialized HIV clinics were closed that were run by nongovernmental organizations and funded by the now-shuttered United States Agency for International Development, USAID.",
      "South African Minister in the Presidency Khumbudzo Ntshavheni told reporters on Thursday that the cabinet welcomed the approval of the PEPFAR Bridge Plan by the U.S.",
      "She said the minimal warning period for countries to prepare their budgets was one of the primary complaints voiced when President Trump stopped PEPFAR funding, and the \u201cbridge plan\u201d sought to address that.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a confirmation of the good bilateral relations between South Africa and the U.S. so that when we have complaints, they intervene and we find an amicable solution to the problem,\u201d Ntshavheni added.",
      "Although the minister struck a positive tone, relations between the two countries have been strained. Trump accused the Black-majority government of presiding over a genocide against minority white Afrikaners, even fast-tracking refugee applications for Afrikaners to resettle in the U.S.",
      "Along with suspending financial aid and imposing 30% tariffs on South Africa\u2019s exports to the U.S., Trump has denounced the country\u2019s stance on the Israel-Hamas conflict.

      "A bishop in the Armenian Apostolic Church has been charged with coercing citizens into public gatherings",
      "YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) \u2014 A bishop in the influential Armenian Apostolic Church has been charged with coercing citizens into taking part in public gatherings in the latest in a series of arrests against critics of the country's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan.",
      "Bishop Mkrtich Proshyan is also accused of using his office to commit large-scale theft and obstruct electoral rights, Armenia\u2019s Investigative Committee said Wednesday.",
      "The Armenian Apostolic Church, whose leaders largely oppose Pashinyan, condemned the arrest as part of a systematic campaign against it. \u201cThere is obvious malicious intent to hinder the normal activities of the church,\u201d it said on social media.",
      "Twelve other clergymen from the same diocese were detained with Proshyan, the church said. It did not specify if they were still being held.",
      "Police launched an investigation into Proshyan in September after a member of the clergy accused the church of pressuring its members to take part in anti-government rallies in 2021. He also accused unnamed senior clergy in Proshyan\u2019s diocese of corruption and misconduct.",
      "Proshyan\u2019s arrest is the latest in a series of high-profile arrests against leading Armenian clergy in recent months as Pashinyan has sought to discredit his political opponents. Archbishop Mikael Ajapahyan, who was arrested in June, has been sentenced to two years in prison after being found guilty of calling for an overthrow of the government.",
      "Pashinyan has repeatedly called for the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church, Catholicos Karekin II, to resign over accusations that he is a father, despite a vow of celibacy. Proshyan is Karekin II\u2019s nephew.",

      "Many clergy, including those linked to the Sacred Struggle opposition group, have bitterly opposed the handover of the villages. Although the territorial concession was the movement\u2019s core issue, it now includes numerous complaints against Pashinyan, who came to power amid a wave of hopeful, pro-democracy protests that swept Armenia in 2018.",
      "Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locked in territorial disputes since the early 1990s, as various parts of the Soviet Union pressed for independence from Moscow. After the collapse of the USSR in 1991, ethnic Armenian separatist forces backed by the Armenian military won control of Azerbaijan\u2019s region of Karabakh and nearby territories.",
      "In 2020, Azerbaijan recaptured broad swaths of territory in and around Karabakh. A lightning military campaign in September 2023 saw Azerbaijan fully reclaim control of the region. Armenia later handed over the border villages.",
      "In August, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan shook hands at a White House summit before signing a deal aimed at ending decades of conflict.",

      "The Vatican\u2019s child protection board says the Catholic Church has a moral duty to help victims of clergy sexual abuse heal",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 The Vatican\u2019s child protection board said Thursday the Catholic Church has a moral obligation to help victims of clergy sexual abuse heal, and identified financial reparations and sanctions for abusers and their enablers as essential remedies.",
      "The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors focused on the issue of reparations in its second annual report. It\u2019s an often sensitive topic for the church, given the financial, reputational and legal implications it imposes on the hierarchy.",
      "The report was significant \u2014 an official Vatican publication prepared with the input of 40 abuse survivors from around the world and giving voice to their complaints of how badly the church had handled their cases, and their demands of what they need to heal.",
      "It said monetary settlements were necessary to provide victims with needed therapy and other assistance to help them recover from the trauma of their abuse.",
      "But it said the church owed a debt far greater to victims, the broader church community and God. The hierarchy must listen to victims and provide them with spiritual and pastoral help. Church leaders must apologize for the harm done, tell victims what they are doing to punish those who harmed them and what measures they are taking to prevent future abuse, the report said.",
      "\u201cThe church bears a moral and spiritual obligation to heal the deep wounds inflicted from sexual violence perpetrated, enabled, mishandled, or covered up by anyone holding a position of authority in the church,\u201d it said.",
      "The report covers 2024, a period before Pope Leo XIV was elected. History\u2019s first American pope has acknowledged that the abuse scandal remains a \u201ccrisis\u201d for the church, and that victims need more than financial reparations to heal.",
      "He has signaled a commitment to the commission, which was created by Pope Francis in 2014 to advise the church on best practices to prevent abuse. In its first decade, the commission struggled to find its footing in a Vatican often resistant to confronting the abuse crisis and hostile to endorsing victim-focused policies.",
      "But more recently, the commission has carved out its space in the Vatican bureaucracy and in July Leo named a new president, French Bishop Thibault Verny.",
      "At a press conference launching the report, Verny said it was evidence of the commission's belief that a culture of prevention in the church requires the active involvement of victims.",
      "The report itself was prepared with victims in a focus group setting who listed priorities for their healing. They identified accountability for church leaders, information about their cases, true reform of church structures to adequately punish abusers and their enablers, and effective prevention strategies.",
      "\u201cThe commission is committed to saying to victims and survivors: \u2018We want to be by your side,\u2019\u201d Verny said.",
      "Significantly, the 2024 report said the church\u2019s way of handling abuse cases internally, according to a secretive process that provides no tangible accountability, was itself retraumatizing for victims.",

      "It was a reference to the church\u2019s dysfunctional way of dealing with abuse cases according to its in-house canonical code, where the most severe punishment meted out to a serial rapist priest amounts to being fired.",
      "The process is cloaked in secrecy, such that victims have no rights to information about their case other than learning its outcome, which often comes after a yearslong wait. Victims have no real recourse other than going public with their story, which can be retraumatizing.",
      "The report called for sanctions that were \u201ctangible and commensurate with the severity of the crime.\u201d While laicization is a possible outcome for priests who rape children, the church is often loathe to remove priests entirely. It frequently gives out lesser sanctions, such as a period of retreat away from active ministry for even gross cases of abuse.",
      "Even when a bishop is removed for bungling cases, the public is only told that he has retired. The report called for the church to \u201cclearly communicate reasons for resignation or removal.\u201d",
      "The report provided an audit of child protection policies and practices in over a dozen countries, as well as within two religious orders, a lay movement and one Vatican office.",
      "The report found that the Vatican\u2019s missionary evangelization office, which is responsible for the church in Africa, Asia and parts of the developing world, has the resources to handle abuse cases.",

      "Mourners in Jerusalem gathered at Capt. Daniel Peretz\u2019s funeral, where Matan Angrest, a recently released hostage, paid his respects",
      "JERUSALEM -- JERUSALEM (AP) \u2014 Two hostages released by Hamas were reunited Wednesday in a Jerusalem cemetery for a final goodbye.",
      "Surrounded by hundreds of mourners, Matan Angrest, who had returned to Israel just two days earlier, stood before the freshly dug grave cradling his 22-year-old commander, Capt. Daniel Peretz, and paid his respects. He prayed for more to make it home, including Sgt. Itay Chen \u2014 another member of their unit whose body is still held in Gaza.",
      "\u201cIt's the least I can do for Daniel and the team that fought with me,\u201d said Angrest, 22, his voice strong despite his pallor and evident weakness. \u201cI\u2019m sure that they are still guarding me from heaven.\u201d",
      "Angrest, Peretz and Chen were serving on a tank crew when they were taken during the Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023; militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 captives that day.",
      "\u201cI wish he could come back. I\u2019m ready to go to Gaza to bring him back,\u201d Angrest said of Chen.",
      "Under the terms of the ceasefire, Hamas is supposed to return all 28 of the deceased hostages\u2019 bodies held in Gaza, but only 10 bodies were released as of early Thursday. One was determined not to be a hostage\u2019s.",
      "That left some families in the devastating limbo they have endured for more than two years, unable to give their loved ones the proper burial that in Judaism is an essential covenant with God, the deceased and the survivors.",
      "\u201cThis is our obligation to God, we take the body and return it to the land,\u201d said Rabbi Benny Lau, a friend of the Peretz family. \u201cThe soul belongs to God and returns to God, but the body is our responsibility.\u201d",
      "The three largest monotheistic religions \u2014 Christianity, Islam and Judaism \u2014 teach that a person\u2019s soul continues to exist after being separated from the body by death. But in Judaism and Islam, there are also specific teachings that the body needs to be left as intact as possible and buried as quickly as possible, with ritual cleansing and prayers.",
      "\u201cThe idea of respecting the dead is intrinsic to the Jewish life cycle,\u201d explained Sharon Laufer, who has volunteered as part of Jewish burial societies, for decades, and is a reserve soldier in a special unit that identifies and prepares bodies of fallen soldiers for burial. \u201cUntil the body is put in the ground, the soul is not complete, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to us.\u201d",
      "In normal circumstances, that means funerals are held within a day. In the case of the Jewish hostages, it translates into the ongoing struggle \u2014 involving government negotiators and family prayers \u2014 to bring everyone's remains back.",
      "\u201cWe cannot close that chapter of these two years without returning all of them,\u201d Lau said.",

      "Itay Chen was 19 when he was abducted on Oct. 7 while doing mandatory military service. Chen was on duty because he had switched weekends with another soldier so he could attend his brother\u2019s bar mitzvah.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bizarre feeling where you start the day anticipating to get the worst phone call that you will in your lifetime, and then feel disappointed when you do not get that phone call,\u201d said his father, Ruby Chen.",

      "A new wave of protests is unfolding worldwide, driven by young people expressing discontent with their governments",
      "NEW DELHI -- NEW DELHI (AP) \u2014 From the Andes to the Himalayas, a new wave of protests is unfolding across the world, driven by generational discontent against governments and anger among young people.",
      "This week, Madagascar's President Andry Rajoelina was forced out of power and out of the country after a military mutiny, the culmination of weeks of demonstrations led by young protesters referring to themselves as \u201cGen Z Madagascar.\u201d",
      "The rage against the political establishment in the Indian Ocean island country mirrors other recent protests across the world, in countries like Nepal, the Philippines, Indonesia, Kenya, Peru and Morocco. These protests have been sparked by specific grievances but are driven by long-simmering issues like widening inequality, economic uncertainty, corruption, and nepotism of leaders.",
      "But they have one thing in common: Mostly leaderless, they are made up primarily of young people who brand themselves as \u201cGen Z,\u201d defined as those born roughly between 1996 and 2010 \u2014 the first generation to grow up entirely in the internet age.",
      "\u201cWhat connects these youth-led protests is a shared sense that traditional political systems aren\u2019t responsive to their generation\u2019s concerns, whether that\u2019s corruption, climate change, or economic inequality. Protest then becomes the logical outlet when institutional channels feel blocked,\u201d said Sam Nadel, director of Social Change Lab, a U.K.-based nonprofit that researches protests and social movements.",
      "Though their specific demands differ, most of these protests have been sparked by government overreach or neglect. Some have also confronted harsh treatment by security forces and brutal repression.",
      "In Morocco, a leaderless collective called Gen Z 212 \u2014 named after Morocco\u2019s dialing code \u2014 has taken to the streets to demand better public services and increased spending on health and education. In Peru, protests over a pension law exploded into broader demands, including action to tackle rising insecurity and widespread corruption in the government. In Indonesia, deadly protests have erupted over lawmakers\u2019 perks and the cost of living, forcing the president to replace key economic and security ministers.",
      "The most widely recognized movement to be dubbed as a \u201cGen Z\u201d protest was a deadly uprising in Nepal that culminated with the resignation of the prime minister in September. Protesters drew inspiration from successful anti-government movements elsewhere in South Asia \u2014 Sri Lanka in 2022 and Bangladesh in 2024 \u2014 which led to the ouster of incumbent regimes.",
      "In Madagascar in turn, protesters say they were particularly inspired by the movements in Nepal and Sri Lanka.",
      "The protests began against regular water and electricity cuts but quickly morphed into wider discontent, as demonstrators called for the president and other ministers to step down. On Wednesday, Madagascar\u2019s military coup leader said he is \u201ctaking the position of president.\u201d",
      "Across multiple countries, a singular pop culture symbol has emerged: a black flag showing a grinning skull and crossbones wearing a straw hat. The flag comes from a cult Japanese manga and anime series called \u201cOne Piece,\u201d which follows a crew of pirates as they take on corrupt governments.",
      "In Nepal, protesters hung the same flag on the gates of the Singha Durbar, the seat of the Nepalese government, and on ministries, many of which were torched in protests. It was also hoisted by crowds in Indonesia, the Philippines, Morocco and Madagascar.",
      "Last week in the Peruvian capital, Lima, 27-year-old electrician David Tafur stood with the same flag in San Mart\u00edn Square, now the stage for weekly protests.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fighting the same battle \u2014 against corrupt officials who, in our case, are also killers,\u201d he said, recalling that President Dina Boluarte\u2019s government held on to power since December 2022 despite more than 500 protests and the deaths of 50 civilians.",

      "\u201cDigital platforms are powerful tools for information sharing and building connections, but the most effective movements often combine digital mobilization with traditional in-person organizing, as we\u2019ve seen in these recent protests,\u201d said Nadel from Social Change Lab.",

      "The country's previous regulations also allowed abortions if a pregnancy posed a threat to the mother\u2019s health. No legislative approval was required for the change.",
      "In making the rule change through the Health Ministry, Chaves made good on a promise he had given religious conservatives at the Evangelical Alliance earlier this month.",
      "\u201cToday the only reason for which an abortion can be done without penalty is when there are only two options: the mother\u2019s life or the life of the being that is inside,\u201d Chaves said during a news conference.",

      "OUISTREHAM, France -- OUISTREHAM, France (AP) \u2014 The captain of the giant Royal Navy battleship called his officers together to give them a first morsel of one of World War II\u2019s most closely guarded secrets: Prepare yourselves, he said, for \u201can extremely important task.\u201d",
      "\u201cSpeculations abound,\u201d one of the officers wrote in his diary that day \u2014 June 2, 1944. \u201cSome say a second front, some say we are to escort the Soviets, or doing something else around Iceland. No one is allowed ashore.\"",
      "The secret was D-Day \u2014 the June 6, 1944, invasion of Nazi-occupied France with the world\u2019s largest-ever sea, land and air armada. It punctured Adolf Hitler\u2019s fearsome \u201cAtlantic Wall\u201d defenses and sped the dictator\u2019s downfall 11 months later.",
      "The diary writer was Lam Ping-yu \u2014 a Chinese officer who crossed the world with two dozen comrades-in-arms from China to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe.",
      "For 32-year-old Lam, watching the landings in Normandy, France, unfold from aboard the battleship HMS Ramillies proved to be momentous.",
      "His meticulously detailed but long-forgotten diary was rescued by urban explorers from a Hong Kong tenement block which was about to be demolished. It is bringing his story back to life and shedding light on the participation of Chinese officers in the multinational invasion.",
      "As survivors of the Battle of Normandy disappear, Lam\u2019s compelling firsthand account adds another vivid voice to the huge library of recollections that the World War II generation is leaving behind, ensuring that its sacrifices for freedom and the international cooperation that defeated Nazism aren\u2019t forgotten.",
      "\u201cSaw the army\u2019s landing craft, as numerous as ants, scattered and wriggling all over the sea, moving southward,\u201d Lam wrote on the evening of June 5, as the invasion fleet steamed across the English Channel.",
      "\u201cEveryone at action stations. We should be able to reach our designated location around 4-5 a.m. tomorrow and initiate bombardment of the French coast,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Sleuthing by history enthusiasts Angus Hui and John Mak in Hong Kong pieced together the story of how Lam found himself aboard HMS Ramillies and proved vital in verifying the authenticity of his 80-page diary, written in 13,000 wispy, delicate Chinese characters.",
      "Hui and Mak have curated and are touring an exhibition about Lam, his diary and the other Chinese officers \u2014 now on display in the Normandy town of Ouistreham.",
      "One breakthrough was their discovery, confirmed in Hong Kong land records, that the abandoned 9th-floor flat where the diary was found had belonged to one of Lam\u2019s brothers.",
      "Another was Hui\u2019s unearthing in British archives of a 1944 ship\u2019s log from HMS Ramillies. A May 29 entry recorded that two Chinese officers had come aboard. Misspelling Lam\u2019s surname, it reads: \u201cJunior Lieut Le Ping Yu Chinese Navy joined ship.\u201d",
      "Lam\u2019s leather-bound black notebook has had a dramatic life, too.",
      "Lost and then found, it has now gone missing again. Hui and Mak say it appears to have been squirreled away somewhere \u2014 possibly taken to the U.S. or the U.K. by people who emigrated from Hong Kong \u2014 after the explorers riffled through the apartment, salvaging the diary, other papers, a suitcase, and other curios, before the building was demolished.",
      "But Hui, who lived close by, got to photograph the diary\u2019s pages before it disappeared, preserving Lam\u2019s account.",
      "\u201cI knew, \u2018Okay, this is a fascinating story that we need to know more about,\u2019\u201d he says.",

      "Lam was part of a group of more than 20 Chinese naval officers sent during World War II for training in the U.K. by Chiang Kai-shek.

      "Monreal, 47, and her husband, Jorge, 57, rely on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health coverage. If Congress doesn\u2019t extend certain ACA tax credits set to expire at the end of the year, their fully subsidized plan will increase in cost, putting it out of reach. Without insurance, they won\u2019t be able to afford his expected knee replacement surgeries, much less the treatment they need for other issues, like her chronic high blood pressure and his high cholesterol.",
      "\u201cIt worries me sometimes, because if you\u2019re not healthy, then you\u2019re not here for your kids,\u201d Monreal said. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult decision, because, OK, do I spend $500 on a doctor\u2019s visit or do I buy groceries?\u201d",
      "Those are the types of choices facing the millions of Americans whose state or federal marketplace health insurance plans will be up for renewal in November. The enhanced premium tax credits that have made coverage more affordable for low- and middle-income enrollees for the last four years will expire this year if Congress doesn't extend them. On average, that will more than double what subsidized enrollees currently pay for premiums next year, according to an analysis by health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "The tax credits are at the heart of the federal government shutdown, in its third week with no end in sight. Democrats have demanded the subsidies be extended as part of any funding deal they sign, while Republicans say they'll only negotiate on the issue once the government is funded.",
      "With Congress deadlocked and the open enrollment period for ACA plans approaching on Nov. 1 in most states, Americans like Monreal are left to navigate the unknown.",

      "While some premium tax credits will remain, the level of support will decrease for most enrollees. Anyone earning more than 400% of the poverty level \u2014 or around $63,000 per year for a single person \u2014 won\u2019t be eligible for the remaining tax credits.",
      "As a result, especially hard-hit groups will include a small number of higher earners who'll have to pay a lot more without the extra subsidies and a large number of lower earners who'll have to pay a small amount more, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president and director of the ACA program at KFF.",
      "With higher premiums, some people will drop out of health insurance altogether, Cox said. When many younger, healthier people inevitably forgo coverage, insurance companies will increase costs for members of the covered population to account for them being older and sicker.",
      "The change may also strain hospitals, since more uninsured people will need emergency care they can\u2019t afford. That could lead to hospital closures or cost increases.",

      "Russia has launched a heavy bombardment on Ukraine's energy facilities, using hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russia battered Ukraine\u2019s energy facilities with hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in its latest heavy bombardment of the country\u2019s power grid, authorities said Thursday, as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy prepared to ask President Donald Trump at a White House meeting for more American-made air defenses and long-range missiles.",
      "Eight Ukrainian regions experienced blackouts after the barrage, Ukraine\u2019s national energy operator, Ukrenergo, said. DTEK, the country\u2019s largest private energy company, reported outages in the capital, Kyiv, and said it had to stop its natural gas extraction in the central Poltava region due to the strikes. Natural gas infrastructure was damaged for the sixth time this month, Naftogaz, Ukraine\u2019s state-owned oil and gas company, said.",
      "Zelenskyy said Russia fired more than 300 drones and 37 missiles at Ukraine overnight. He accused Russia of using cluster munitions and conducting repeated strikes on the same target to hit emergency crews and engineers working to repair the grid.",
      "\u201cThis fall, the Russians are using every single day to strike our energy infrastructure,\u201d Zelenskyy said on Telegram.",
      "The Ukrainian power grid been one of Russia\u2019s main targets since its invasion of its neighbor more than three years ago. Attacks increase as the bitterly cold months approach in a Russian strategy that Ukrainian officials call \u201cweaponizing winter.\u201d Russia says it aims only at targets of military value.",
      "Ukrainian forces have resisted Russia\u2019s bigger and better equipped army, limiting it to a grinding war of attrition along the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line snaking through eastern and southern regions.",
      "But Ukraine, which is almost the size of Texas, is hard to defend from the air in its entirety, and Kyiv officials are seeking more Western help to fend against aerial attacks and strike back at Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy was expected to arrive in the United States on Thursday, ahead of his Oval Office meeting with Trump on Friday.",
      "Ukraine is seeking cruise missiles, air defense systems and joint drone production agreements from the United States, Kyiv officials say. Zelenskyy also wants tougher international economic sanctions on Moscow.",
      "The visit comes amid signs that Trump is leaning toward steping up pressure on Russian President Vladimir Putin to break the deadlock in U.S.-led peace efforts.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Wednesday in Brussels that if Russia won\u2019t budge from its objections and refuses to negotiate a peace deal, Washington \u201cwill take the steps necessary to impose costs on Russia for its continued aggression.\u201d",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not saying kids shouldn\u2019t go to college,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m just saying all kids don\u2019t have to go in order to be successful.\u201d",
      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump on Wednesday welcomed nearly 130 deep-pocketed donors, allies and representatives of major companies for a dinner at the White House to reward them for their pledged contributions to a massive new ballroom.",
      "The ballroom, whose price tag is now estimated at $250 million, is the most significant renovation that Trump, a former real estate mogul, is undertaking during his second term at the White House.",
      "All four sides of the ballroom \u2014 which Trump said will be large and grand enough to hold even a presidential inauguration -- will be made of bulletproof glass, with its color, window shape and molding keeping in character with the White House. Trump indicated that the fundraising and managing costs for the \u201cphenomenal\u201d ballroom were going well, predicting that he would have money left over after the project is done.",
      "\u201cTo me, there\u2019s nothing like the White House,\u201d Trump said, later adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just a special place so we have to take care of it.\u201d",
      "Men in business suits and women in cocktail attire sat at a dozen round tables, decorated with tall, tapered candles and white floral arrangements, and sipped wine and water as they awaited their dinner to be served on gold-trimmed plates. Later, they would dine on an heirloom tomato panzanella salad, beef Wellington and a dessert of roasted Anjou pears, cinnamon crumble and butterscotch ice cream.",
      "Among the companies that had representatives at the dinner, according to a White House official, were Amazon, Apple, Booz Allen Hamilton, Coinbase, Comcast, Google, Lockheed Martin, Meta Platforms and T-Mobile. The Adelson Family Foundation, founded by GOP megadonors Miriam Adelson and her late husband Sheldon, also had a presence there.",
      "Oil billionaire Harold Hamm, Blackstone CEO Steve Schwarzman, Small Business Administration chief Kelly Loeffler and her husband, Jeff Sprecher, and crypto entrepreneurs Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss were all on the guest list. The list of attendees was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.",
      "Also attending the dinner were Chris LaCivita, Trump's co-campaign manager from his 2024 reelection bid; Reince Priebus, a White House chief of staff during Trump's first term; and Jason Miller, another longtime political adviser.",
      "The new ballroom is planned for the area where the East Wing is located and will encompass 90,000 square feet. The White House has previously said it will have a 650-person capacity, but Trump on Wednesday night said it will be able to hold up to 999 people.",

      "At the dinner, Trump said there are no zoning requirements for him as the president of the United States and he can do whatever he wants with the construction.",
      "The president has repeatedly complained that large White House events require construction of a tent on the South Lawn, since the East Room \u2013 the current largest space at the White House \u2013 can accommodate only about 200 people.",
      "At the dinner, Trump also formally unveiled another project: an arch that will stand on one end of the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which crosses the Potomac River and connects Virginia and the District of Columbia.

      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford has called for economic retaliation against the U.S. after Stellantis decided to move Jeep Compass production from Canada to the U.S. Ford blames U.S. President Donald Trump for the move, which affects workers in Brampton, Ont...",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 The leader of Canada's most populous province called for economic retaliation on the U.S. after auto company Stellantis said it was moving planned production of its Jeep Compass from Canada to the U.S.",
      "Ontario Premier Doug Ford blamed U.S. President Donald Trump for the company's decision this week to shift production of the SUV from Brampton, Ontario, to Illinois as part of plan to invest $13 billion to expand its manufacturing capacity in the United States.",
      "The comments come as Canada is negotiating to reduce tariffs. Trump has been urging the Big 3 American automakers to move production to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThat guy, President Trump, he\u2019s a real piece of work,\u201d Ford said. \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of rolling over. We need to fight back.\"",
      "Ford said Canada needs to hit back with tariffs if Prime Minister Mark Carney can't reach a trade deal with Trump.",
      "Dominic LeBlanc, the minister responsible for Canada-U.S. trade, is in Washington this week for talks to reduce tariffs on certain sectors. Carney left Washington last week without a deal.",
      "Carney said the move by the world\u2019s fourth-largest carmaker was a direct consequence of tariffs and his government would work with Stellantis to create new opportunities in the Brampton area. Carney added that Ottawa expects Stellantis to fulfill its commitment to Brampton workers. The federal government threatened legal action against the company.",
      "Federal Industry Minister M\u00e9lanie Joly said the production shift is \u201cunacceptable\u201d and warned Stellantis made commitments to Canadian production in exchange for substantial financial support.",
      "\"Anything short of fulfilling that commitment will be considered as default under our agreements,\u201d Joly wrote in a letter to the company chief executive.",
      "Fear has spread in Ontario over what will happen to Canada's auto sector. Autos are Canada\u2019s second-largest export and Carney has noted the sector employs 125,000 Canadians directly and almost another 500,000 in related industries.",
      "\u201cStellantis is bowing at the Trump administration with this pledge of massive investments in the U.S.,\u201d Brampton Mayor Patrick Brown told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.",

      "Workers at the Stellantis assembly plant in Brampton were greeted Wednesday with a robocall from their employer that said work they\u2019d been waiting for wouldn\u2019t be coming back. The company closed the factory in 2023 and laid off its roughly 3,000 workers as it retooled the facility.",
      "Stellantis said it would reopen its Belvidere Assembly Plant in Illinois to expand U.S. Jeep production, creating thousands of new jobs there.",
      "Vito Beato, president of Unifor Local 1285, which represents the Brampton plant workers, said the news came as a surprise because Stellantis had said previously it was committed to producing its Jeep Compass in Brampton.",
      "Stellantis said it continues to invest in Canada, including adding a third shift to the Windsor, Ontario assembly plant, and that it is in talks with the government on the future of the Brampton facility.",
      "Carney won the country\u2019s election earlier this year fueled by Trump\u2019s annexation threats and trade war, but has tried to improve relations ahead of a review of the free trade deal next year. More than 75% of Canada\u2019s exports go to the U.S. and Canada recently dropped many of its retaliatory tariffs to match U.S. tariff exemptions for goods covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada trade pact.",
      "Ford said Canada should start responding to Trump's tariffs with its own harsh measures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing that this person understands,\u201d Ford said of Trump. Ford is scheduled to meet with Carney this week.",

      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy says he will withhold $40 million from California because it is the only state that is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Wednesday he will withhold $40 million from California because it is the only state that is failing to enforce English language requirements for truckers.",
      "An investigation launched after a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver who made an illegal U-turn on Aug. 12 found what Duffy called significant failures in the way California is enforcing rules that took effect in June after one of President Donald Trump\u2019s executive orders. California had issued the driver a commercial license, but these English rules predate the crash.",
      "Truckers are supposed to be disqualified if they can\u2019t demonstrate English proficiency, and Duffy said the driver involved in the crash should not have been given a commercial license because of his immigration status. The crash has become increasingly political, with the governors of California and Florida criticizing each other and Duffy highlighting the administration\u2019s immigration concerns in interviews.",
      "\u201cCalifornia is the only state in the nation that refuses to ensure big rig drivers can read our road signs and communicate with law enforcement. This is a fundamental safety issue that impacts you and your family on America\u2019s road,\u201d Duffy said.",
      "California defended its practices in a formal response to the Transportation Department last month, but federal officials weren't satisfied.",
      "The office of California Gov. Gavin Newsom quickly pushed back after the announcement Wednesday. Diana Crofts-Pelayo, a spokesperson for the governor, said statistics show that California commercial truck drivers have a lower crash rate than the national average.",
      "But Duffy said when he announced his concerns in August that California had conducted roughly 34,000 inspections that found at least one violation since the new language standards took effect. But only one inspection involved an English language rules violation that resulted in a driver being taken out of service. And 23 drivers with violations in other states were allowed to continue driving after inspections in California.",
      "The Transportation Department said that to get this funding reinstated, California must adopt regulations to enforce the English rules and ensure that state inspectors are testing truck drivers' English skills during roadside inspections and pulling anyone that fails out of service.",
      "In addition to this English language issue, Duffy has threatened to pull another $160 million from California because of the way the state issues commercial drivers licenses. Duffy significantly restricted who can qualify for those licenses last month.",

      "Journalists at the Pentagon turned in access badges and cleaned out their workspaces, the price for refusing to agree to new restrictions on their jobs at the seat of U.S. military power",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Dozens of reporters turned in access badges and exited the Pentagon on Wednesday rather than agree to government-imposed restrictions on their work, pushing journalists who cover the American military further from the seat of its power. The nation's leadership called the new rules \u201ccommon sense\u201d to help regulate a \u201cvery disruptive\u201d press.",
      "News outlets were nearly unanimous in rejecting new rules imposed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that would leave journalists vulnerable to expulsion if they sought to report on information \u2014 classified or otherwise \u2014 that had not been approved by Hegseth for release.",
      "Many of the reporters waited to leave together at a 4 p.m. deadline set by the Defense Department to get out of the building. As the hour approached, boxes of documents lined a Pentagon corridor and reporters carried chairs, a copying machine, books and old photos to the parking lot from suddenly abandoned workspaces. Shortly after 4, about 40 to 50 journalists left together after handing in badges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad, but I\u2019m also really proud of the press corps that we stuck together,\u201d said Nancy Youssef, a reporter for The Atlantic who has had a desk at the Pentagon since 2007. She took a map of the Middle East out to her car.",
      "It is unclear what practical impact the new rules will have, though news organizations vowed they\u2019d continue robust coverage of the military no matter the vantage point.",
      "Images of reporters effectively demonstrating against barriers to their work are unlikely to move supporters of President Donald Trump, many of whom resent journalists and cheer his efforts to make their jobs harder. Trump has been involved in court fights against The New York Times, CBS News, ABC News, the Wall Street Journal and The Associated Press in the past year.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Trump backed his defense secretary\u2019s new rules. \u201cI think he finds the press to be very disruptive in terms of world peace,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe press is very dishonest.\u201d",
      "Even before issuing his new press policy, Hegseth, a former Fox News Channel host, has systematically choked off the flow of information. He\u2019s held only two formal press briefings, banned reporters from accessing many parts of the sprawling Pentagon without an escort and launched investigations into leaks to the media.",
      "He has called his new rules \u201ccommon sense\u201d and said the requirement that journalists sign a document outlining the rules means they acknowledge the new rules, not necessarily agree to them. Journalists see that as a distinction without a difference.",
      "\u201cWhat they\u2019re really doing, they want to spoon-feed information to the journalist, and that would be their story. That\u2019s not journalism,\u201d said Jack Keane, a retired U.S. Army general and Fox News analyst, said on Hegseth\u2019s former network.",
      "When he served, Keane said he required new brigadier generals to take a class on the role of the media in a democracy so they wouldn\u2019t be intimidated and also see reporters as a conduit to the American public. \u201cThere were times when stories were done that made me flinch a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s usually because we had done something that wasn\u2019t as good as we should have done it.\u201d",

      "In the lawsuit, which was filed Monday in federal court in Ohio, Smucker said the round, crustless sandwiches Trader Joe's sells have the same pie-like crimp markings on their edges that Uncrustables do. Smucker said the design violates its trademarks.",
      "Smucker also asserted that the boxes Trader Joe\u2019s PB&J sandwiches come in violate the Orrville, Ohio-based company's trademarks because they are the same blue color it uses for the lettering on \u201cUncrustables\u201d packages.",
      "Trader Joe\u2019s boxes also show a sandwich with a bite mark taken out of it, which is similar to the Uncrustables design, Smucker said.",
      "\u201cSmucker does not take issue with others in the marketplace selling prepackaged, frozen, thaw-and-eat crustless sandwiches. But it cannot allow others to use Smucker\u2019s valuable intellectual property to make such sales,\u201d the company said in its lawsuit.",
      "Smucker is seeking restitution from Trader Joe's. It also wants a judge to require Trader Joe's to deliver all products and packaging to Smucker to be destroyed.",
      "A message seeking comment was left Wednesday with Trader Joe\u2019s, which is based in Monrovia, California.",
      "Michael Kelber, chair of the intellectual property group at Neal Gerber Eisenberg, a Chicago law firm, said Smucker's registered trademarks will help bolster its argument. But Trader Joe's might argue that the crimping on its sandwiches is simply functional and not something that can be trademarked, Kelber said.",
      "Trader Joe's sandwiches also appear to be slightly more square than Uncrustables, so the company could argue that the shape isn't the same, Kelber said.",
      "Uncrustables were invented by two friends who began producing them in 1996 in Fergus Falls, Minnesota. Smucker bought their company in 1998 and secured patents for a \u201csealed, crustless sandwich\u201d in 1999.",
      "But it wasn\u2019t easy to mass produce them. In the lawsuit, Smucker said it has spent more than $1 billion developing the Uncrustables brand over the last 20 years. Smucker spent years trying to perfect Uncrustables\u2019 stretchy bread and developing new filling flavors like chocolate and hazelnut.",

      "This isn\u2019t the first time Smucker has taken legal action to protect its Uncrustables brand. In 2022, it sent a cease and desist letter to a Minnesota company called Gallant Tiger, which was making upscale versions of crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with crimped edges. Smucker said Wednesday that it hasn't taken further action but continues to monitor Gallant Tiger.",
      "Smucker likely felt it had no choice but to sue this time around, Kelber said.",

      "Cambodia's government says it hopes the U.S. and Britain have enough evidence in their pursuit of Cambodia\u2019s Prince Holding Group and its Chairman Chen Zhi",
      "PHNOM PENH, Cambodia -- PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) \u2014 Cambodia's government said Wednesday it hopes the U.S. and Britain have sufficient evidence in their pursuit of Prince Holding Group and its Chairman Chen Zhi, after both governments imposed coordinated sanctions accusing the Cambodian conglomerate of running massive online scams and using forced labor.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s Interior Ministry spokesman Touch Sokhak said Prince Holding Group has met all legal requirements to operate in Cambodia and has been treated no differently than other major companies investing in the country. He also said the Cambodian citizenship given to China native Chen was in accordance with the law.",
      "Touch Sokhak said Cambodia will cooperate if there is a formal request backed by evidence. \u201cWe do not protect individuals who violate the law,\u201d he said, but stressed that Cambodia\u2019s government itself does not accuse Prince Holding Group or Chen Zhi of wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have much to say about the American and British authorities\u2019 seeking to arrest him, but first, we just hope that there will be arguments and sufficient proof to put against him,\" Touch Sokhak told The Associated Press.",
      "The U.S. Treasury Department and U.K. Foreign Office on Tuesday announced joint sanctions against Chen and his conglomerate, accused of being a transnational criminal network that has defrauded victims worldwide and exploited trafficked workers across Southeast Asia.",
      "It came after U.S. authorities seized more than $14 billion in bitcoin and charged Chen, 38, with wire fraud and money laundering conspiracies. Chen was accused of sanctioning violence against workers, authorizing bribes to foreign officials and using his other businesses, such as online gambling and cryptocurrency mining, to launder illicit profits. U.S. Attorney Joseph Nocella called it \u201cone of the largest investment fraud operations in history.\u201d",
      "In London, British authorities froze Chen\u2019s British businesses and assets, including a 12 million euro ($13.9 million) mansion in North London, a 100 million euro ($116 million) office building in the City of London, and multiple luxury flats across the capital.",
      "John Wojcik, a senior threat researcher for Infoblox, who previously tracked cybercrime in Southeast Asia for the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime, said the joint U.S.-British action marked a major strike against one of the largest cybercriminal and money laundering enterprises in Southeast Asia, but that more must be done.",
      "\"Unless law enforcement and industry partners can trace and dismantle their online infrastructure \u2014 the domains, hosting and payment rails that sustain them \u2014 these networks will rebrand, retool, and continue to scale,\u201d Wojcik said.",
      "Chen remains at large. If convicted in the U.S., he faces up to 40 years in prison. Prince Holding Group has previously denied involvement in scam operations and has not publicly responded to the latest allegations.",
      "The two governments allege that Chen\u2019s network operated scam compounds in Cambodia that used trafficked foreign nationals to run online \u201cromance\u201d and cryptocurrency investment scams. Victims were tricked into investing life savings in fake trading platforms, while trafficked workers were forced to carry out the frauds under threat of torture.",

      "Federal workers furloughed or working without pay are feeling the financial squeeze and fear being swept up in the Trump administration's layoffs",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 With every passing day of the government shutdown, hundreds of thousands of federal employees furloughed or working without pay face mounting financial strain. And now they are confronting new uncertainty with the Trump administration's promised layoffs.",
      "Little progress has been made to end the shutdown as it enters its third week, with Republicans and Democrats digging in and convinced their messaging is resonating with voters. The fate of the federal workers is among several pressure points that could eventually push the sides to agree to resolve the stalemate.",
      "\u201cLuckily I was able to pay rent this month,\u201d said Peter Farruggia, a furloughed federal worker. \u201cBut for sure I am going to have bills that are going to go unpaid this month, and I really don\u2019t have many options.\u201d",
      "The shutdown has a familiar feel for many federal employees who endured past stalemates \u2014 including during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term \u2014 but this time, the stakes are higher. The Republican White House is leveraging federal workers\u2019 jobs to pressure Democrats to soften their demands. A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the administration from firing workers during the shutdown, saying the human cost \u201ccannot be tolerated.\u201d",
      "The shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Trump and other Republican leaders have said the government must reopen before they will negotiate with Democrats on the health subsidies.",
      "Farruggia is the executive committee chair of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, representing employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an agency that faced a wave of layoffs over the weekend. Like 8,000 other CDC employees who have been furloughed from the agency, he was already living paycheck to paycheck, and the partial pay that arrived Friday was his last until the government comes back online.",
      "With the agency's leadership in turmoil and still rattled from a shooting, the shutdown and new firings mean \u201cpeople are scared, nervous, anxious, but also really just exasperated,\u201d Farruggia said.",
      "After Russ Vought, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said last week on social media that the \u201cRIFs have begun,\u201d referring to reduction-in-force plans aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, Vice President JD Vance doubled down on the threat Sunday, saying \u201cthe longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be.\"",
      "The layoffs have begun across federal agencies. Labor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the move by Trump\u2019s budget office.",
      "In a court filing on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees from eight departments and agencies would be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.",
      "Jessica Sweet, an Albany, New York, Social Security claims specialist who is a union steward of AFGE Local 3343 in New York, said, \u201cI, myself, have a backup plan\u201d in case she is fired during the shutdown, \u201cbut I know most people don't.\u201d",
      "She says the Social Security Administration is already so short-staffed from layoffs earlier this year brought on by the Department of Government Efficiency, she doesn't fear a massive layoff during the shutdown.",
      "\u201cThe one thing this administration has taught me is that nothing is ever for certain, even if it's codified into law,\" she said.",
      "Having received a partial payment in her last paycheck, Sweet has begun reaching out to her local power companies to request that she not get charged late fees, since \u201cmy bills won't wait for me to eventually get paid.\u201d",
      "For some federal workers, this isn\u2019t their first shutdown \u2014 the last one, during Trump\u2019s first term in 2019, stretched a record 34 days. But this time, federal employees are being used more directly as leverage in the political fight over government funding.",
      "The Republican administration last week warned that there would be no guaranteed back pay for federal workers during a shutdown \u2014 a reversal of long-standing policy affecting roughly 750,000 furloughed employees, according to a White House memo. The move, which Trump later backtracked on, was widely seen as a strong-arm tactic.",

      "Pelletier, a union leader for NLRB local 3, said \u201cright now, nothing is being investigated at the NLRB. There\u2019s no elections for unions or elections for decertifications. Basically nothing is happening.\u201d",
      "As for the financial strain on workers, he said workers can't even find alternate employment to weather the shutdown because \"the ethics office that would approve of those requests is not staffed now.\"",
      "National Treasury Employees Union President Doreen Greenwald, which represents workers across dozens of federal agencies, said several of the union's members had been laid off as of Friday. The Treasury Department would lose 1,446 workers, according to the filing.",
      "Greenwald said it was unfortunate that the Trump administration was using \u201cfederal employees as political pawns by furloughing and proposing to fire them all to try to cause pressure in a political game of chicken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about one party or the other. It\u2019s about real people,\u201d said Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees.",
      "\u201cThe correction officer worrying about his next paycheck. The TSA officer who still shows up to work because he or she loves their country, even though they\u2019re not getting paid. No American should ever have to choose between serving their country and feeding their family,\u201d Kelley said.",
      "Kelley and other major federal worker union leaders gathered blocks from the Capitol last week, urging congressional leaders to find a solution and put \u201cpeople over politics.\u201d The event grew emotional at times, with union heads outlining the difficulties facing their members and the stakes growing daily.",
      "Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, which represents 110,000 workers nationwide, called on both sides of Congress to find a resolution. He said Trump appeared to aim to \u201cdegrade, frighten, antagonize hardworking federal employees.\u201d",
      "Chris Bartley, political program coordinator for the International Association of Fire Fighters, said thousands of firefighters were showing up for work without pay out of a sense of devotion but stressed that could have broader consequences.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government shutdown\u2019s strain on the aviation system is starting to show",
      "A startling message came over the radio from an air traffic control tower near Los Angeles less than a week into the federal government shutdown: \u201cThe tower is closed due to staffing.\"",
      "Without enough air traffic controllers to guide planes into and out of Hollywood Burbank Airport, the tower went dark for almost six hours on Oct. 6, leaving pilots to coordinate their movements among themselves. Flight delays averaged two-and-a-half hours in one of the first visible signs that the shutdown was already taking a toll on the nation's aviation system.",
      "Since the shutdown began Oct. 1, the Federal Aviation Administration has reported controller shortages in cities across the U.S., from airports in Boston and Philadelphia, to control centers in Atlanta and Houston. Flight delays have spread to airports in Nashville, Dallas, Newark and more.",
      "And already there has been an increase in unscheduled absences among security screeners at some airports. The union representing Transportation Security Administration employees says the absences haven't yet caused major disruptions, but it warned longer lines at security checkpoints could soon become a reality after workers received their final paychecks over the weekend.",
      "Experts and union leaders say the disruptions are a stark reminder that the aviation system is already stretched too thin by chronic understaffing and outdated technology. They warn the cracks in the system could rapidly deepen the longer the shutdown drags on and critical aviation workers are without their regular paychecks.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like having a drought the year after you had a drought,\u201d Greg Raiff, CEO of Elevate Aviation Group, told The Associated Press.",
      "These concerns aren't new. In 2019, the aviation system buckled under the weight of a 35-day government shutdown \u2014 the longest in U.S. history \u2014 during President Donald Trump's first term.",
      "Around the three-week mark, air traffic controllers, many of them working up to 60 hours a week, sued the government over their missed paychecks. One terminal at the Miami International Airport was forced to close because security screeners were calling out sick in large numbers. Some even quit altogether.",
      "\u201cHere we are so many years later, and the problems have not been addressed,\" said aviation attorney Ricardo Martinez-Cid, a Florida Bar-certified expert on aviation law who regularly represents crash victims. \u201cNow we're in a worse position when we had been put on notice. We had the opportunity to address it.\"",
      "Since then, the country has faced repeated warnings. In January, a mid-air crash over the Potomac River involving a commercial jet and a military helicopter killed 67 people. A series of equipment failures and radar outages this year also highlighted the need for upgrades.",
      "Before the latest shutdown, both the FAA and TSA were already dealing with staffing shortages. That includes a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers.",
      "Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, has said staffing levels have reached a \u201ccritical\u201d point, the lowest in decades. The shortage is so severe that even a few air traffic controllers missing work can disrupt operations at already understaffed facilities.",
      "\u201cAnd on top of that,\" he said, \u201cthey\u2019re working with unreliable equipment.\u201d",
      "The shutdown began just as the FAA was starting to make some progress on addressing the shortage of controllers and modernizing the outdated equipment they rely on that keeps disrupting flights when it malfunctions.",

      "Swedish Defense Minister P\u00e5l Jonson said that \u201cSweden stands ready to do more.\u201d He welcomed discussions among other Nordic countries and the Baltic nations \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 on sending an extra load too.",
      "\u201cThis is critical now because we\u2019ve been seeing the wrong trajectory when it comes to support to Ukraine, that it\u2019s been going down and we want to see more stepping up,\u201d Jonson told reporters at NATO headquarters, where defense ministers were meeting.",

      "Indeed, new data on Western military aid to Ukraine shows that despite the PURL program, support plunged by 43% in July and August compared to the first half of the year, according to Germany\u2019s Kiel Institute, which tracks deliveries and funding for Kyiv.",

      "The company is seeking $347 million for the delays, and says if the state blocks it from restarting the onshore pipeline system, it will use a floating facility that would keep its entire operation in federal waters and use tankers to transport the oil to markets outside California. In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the company updated its plan to include the option.",
      "The U.S. Interior Department\u2019s Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement said in July it was working with Sable to bring a second rig online.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump made it clear that American energy should come from American resources,\u201d the agency\u2019s deputy director Kenny Stevens said in a statement then, heralding the \"comeback story for Pacific production.\u201d",
      "The agency said there are an estimated 190 million barrels (6 billion gallons) of recoverable oil reserves in the area, nearly 80% of residual Pacific reserves. It noted advancements in preventing and preparing for oil spills and said the failed pipeline has been rigorously tested.",
      "\u201cContinuous monitoring and improved technology significantly reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future,\u201d the agency said.",
      "On May 19 \u2014 the 10th anniversary of the disaster \u2014 CEO Jim Flores announced that Sable \u201cis proud to have safely and responsibly achieved first production at the Santa Ynez Unit\u201d \u2014 which includes three rigs in federal waters, offshore and onshore pipelines, and the Las Flores Canyon Processing Facility.",
      "State officials countered that the company had only conducted testing and not commercial production. Sable's stock price dropped and some investors sued, alleging they were misled.",
      "Sable purchased the Santa Ynez Unit from Exxon Mobil in 2024 for nearly $650 million primarily with a loan from Exxon. Exxon sold the shuttered operation after losing a court battle in 2023 to truck the crude through central California while the pipeline system was rebuilt or repaired.",
      "Flores said well tests at the Platform Harmony rig indicate there is much oil to be extracted and that it will relieve California's gas prices \u2014 among the nation's highest \u2014 by stabilizing supplies.",
      "\u201cSable is very concerned about the crumbling energy complex in California,\" Flores said in a statement to The Associated Press. \u201cWith the exit of two refineries last year and more shuttering soon, California\u2019s economy cannot survive without the strong energy infrastructure it enjoyed for the last 150 years.\u201d",
      "California has been reducing the state\u2019s production of fossil fuels in favor of clean energy for years. The movement has been spearheaded partly by Santa Barbara County, where elected officials voted in May to begin taking steps to phase out onshore oil and gas operations.",

Mead said Kay was a good employee 95% of the time but occasionally engaged in questionable conduct such as yelling at an intern, having an affair with another and taking money from players for stunts like getting hit by a fast-moving pitch.",
      "\u201cHe was a good worker, he was a good performer. I saw the bounce back if there was to be what I would call an off day,\u201d said Mead, who now works as an adjunct professor. \u201cI took him at his word for knowing his condition and what he was managing.\u201d",
      "Mead said he believed Kay was mismanaging his medication, and said Kay told him sometimes he didn't take it, and never heard anything about him taking illegal drugs. When a lawyer for the plaintiff's family asked why Mead didn't report Kay's issues to the team, Mead said Kay was participating in an employee assistance program that he considered \u201cpart of the organization.\u201d",
      "In April 2019, Mead said concerns about Kay rose to a new level when he was behaving unusually at work then wound up hospitalized later that night. Mead said he went to see Kay the next day.",
      "\u201cHe was a mess. His eyes were half rolled up his head,\u201d Mead said. \u201cThere was obviously something very very wrong.\u201d",
      "Skaggs' wife, Carli, and parents filed a wrongful-death lawsuit contending the team failed to follow its drug policies and allowed an addicted and drug-dealing employee, Kay, to have access to its players.",

The team has also said its officials were not aware Skaggs was taking drugs or they would have tried to help him.",

      "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa apologized for comments he made following Sunday's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers in which he revealed some teammates were showing up late to player-led meetings.",
      "Tagovailoa opened his news conference Wednesday with an apology to his teammates for the comments, which have drawn widespread criticism over the past few days.",
      "\"As a leader of this team, of the Miami Dolphins, the comments that had been said, I've made a mistake,\u201d Tagovailoa said, \u201cand I'm owning up to that right now. I've talked to guys on the team about it, talked to the leaders about it, and they know my heart. They know that the intent was right. But no matter the intent ... when things get misconstrued or however the media wants to portray it, that leaves a void of silence and a lot of questions for the guys on our team.",
      "\"Now being 1-5, we talk a lot about, \u2018We've got to get this going, come in excited to go to work, forget about the noise.\u2019 And I feel like I just added onto that for our guys.\u201d",
      "After the Dolphins fell 29-27 to the Chargers, Tagovailoa was asked how to keep up team morale after a second straight game in which they had a chance to put their opponent away but failed to deliver.",
      "\u201cI think it starts with the leadership in helping articulate that for the guys,\u201d Tagovailoa said Sunday, \u201cand then what we\u2019re expecting out of the guys. We\u2019re expecting this. Are we getting that? Are we not getting that?",
      "\u201cWe have guys showing up to player-only meetings late. Guys not showing up to player-only meetings. There is a lot that goes into that. Do we have to make that mandatory? Do we not have to make that mandatory? So it\u2019s a lot of things of that nature that we got to get cleaned up. It starts with the little things like that.\u201d",
      "His comments drew widespread scrutiny from former NFL players and analysts criticizing the quarterback for publicly calling out teammates. Coach Mike McDaniel said that while Tagovailoa's intent may have been right, a postgame news conference was not the right forum to voice those frustrations.",

And that\u2019s something that I can learn from as a leader on this team. What happens in-house should be protected, and none of that should have gotten out. So I want to publicly apologize about that.\"",
      "Tagovailoa said he has since had conversations with teammates to clear the air. Several players were asked about his comments this week and declined to discuss the matter in detail, only mentioning that team issues should be kept in-house.",

      "The double comets could be visible with binoculars through the end of the month, but experts aren't yet sure how bright they'll remain, said astronomer Valerie Rapson of the State University of New York at Oneonta.",
      "Comets are frozen leftovers from the solar system\u2019s formation billions of years ago. They heat up as they swing toward the sun, releasing their characteristic streaming tails.",
      "Comet Lemmon, also designated C/2025 A6, was discovered in January by a telescope scouring the night sky for near-Earth asteroids. Comet SWAN, also known as C/2025 R2, was spotted in September by an amateur astronomer using photos from a spacecraft operated by NASA and the European Space Agency.",

      "For many young Americans, deciding on college has become a complex choice",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 For a generation of young Americans, choosing where to go to college \u2014 or whether to go at all \u2014 has become a complex calculation of costs and benefits that often revolves around a single question: Is the degree worth its price?",
      "Public confidence in higher education has plummeted in recent years amid high tuition prices, skyrocketing student loans and a dismal job market \u2014 plus ideological concerns from conservatives. Now, colleges are scrambling to prove their value to students.",
      "Borrowed from the business world, the term \u201creturn on investment\u201d has been plastered on college advertisements across the U.S. A battery of new rankings grade campuses on the financial benefits they deliver. States such as Colorado have started publishing yearly reports on the monetary payoff of college, and Texas now factors it into calculations for how much taxpayer money goes to community colleges.",
      "\u201cStudents are becoming more aware of the times when college doesn\u2019t pay off,\" said Preston Cooper, who has studied college ROI at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. \u201cIt's front of mind for universities today in a way that it was not necessarily 15, 20 years ago.\"",
      "A wide body of research indicates a bachelor's degree still pays off, at least on average and in the long run. Yet there\u2019s growing recognition that not all degrees lead to a good salary, and even some that seem like a good bet are becoming riskier as graduates face one of the toughest job markets in years.",
      "A new analysis released Thursday by the Strada Education Foundation finds 70% of recent public university graduates can expect a positive return within 10 years \u2014 meaning their earnings over a decade will exceed that of a typical high school graduate by an amount greater than the cost of their degree. Yet it varies by state, from 53% in North Dakota to 82% in Washington, D.C. States where college is more affordable have fared better, the report says.",
      "It's a critical issue for families who wonder how college tuition prices could ever pay off, said Emilia Mattucci, a high school counselor at East Allegheny schools, near Pittsburgh. More than two-thirds of her school\u2019s students come from low-income families, and many aren't willing to take on the level of debt that past generations accepted.",
      "Instead, more are heading to technical schools or the trades and passing on four-year universities, she said.",
      "\u201cA lot of families are just saying they can\u2019t afford it, or they don\u2019t want to go into debt for years and years and years,\u201d she said.",
      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon has been among those questioning the need for a four-year degree. Speaking at the Reagan Institute think tank in September, McMahon praised programs that prepare students for careers right out of high school.",

      "American higher education has been grappling with both sides of the ROI equation \u2014 tuition costs and graduate earnings. It\u2019s becoming even more important as colleges compete for decreasing numbers of college-age students as a result of falling birth rates.",
      "Tuition rates have stayed flat on many campuses in recent years to address affordability concerns, and many private colleges have lowered their sticker prices in an effort to better reflect the cost most students actually pay after factoring in financial aid.",
      "The other part of the equation \u2014 making sure graduates land good jobs \u2014 is more complicated.",
      "A group of college presidents recently met at Gallup\u2019s Washington headquarters to study public polling on higher education. One of the chief reasons for flagging confidence is a perception that colleges aren\u2019t giving graduates the skills employers need, said Kevin Guskiewicz, president of Michigan State University, one of the leaders at the meeting.",

The goal is to mold degree programs to the job market's needs and to get students internships and work experience that can lead to a job.",
      "Bridging the gap to the job market has been a persistent struggle for U.S. colleges, said Matt Sigelman, president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank that studies the workforce. Last year the institute, partnering with Strada researchers, found 52% of recent college graduates were in jobs that didn\u2019t require a degree. Even higher-demand fields, such as education and nursing, had large numbers of graduates in that situation.",
      "\u201cNo programs are immune, and no schools are immune,\u201d Sigelman said.",
      "The federal government has been trying to fix the problem for decades, going back to President Barack Obama's administration. A federal rule first established in 2011 aimed to cut federal money to college programs that leave graduates with low earnings, though it primarily targeted for-profit colleges.",
      "A Republican reconciliation bill passed this year takes a wider view, requiring most colleges to hit earnings standards to be eligible for federal funding. The goal is to make sure college graduates end up earning more than those without a degree.",
      "Others see transparency as a key solution.",
      "For decades, students had little way to know whether graduates of specific degree programs were landing good jobs after college. That started to change with the College Scorecard in 2015, a federal website that shares broad earnings outcomes for college programs. More recently, bipartisan legislation in Congress has sought to give the public even more detailed data.",
      "Lawmakers in North Carolina ordered a 2023 study on the financial return for degrees across the state\u2019s public universities. It found that 93% produced a positive return, meaning graduates were expected to earn more over their lives than someone without a similar degree.",
      "The data is available to the public, showing, for example, that undergraduate degrees in applied math and business tend to have high returns at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, while graduate degrees in psychology and foreign languages often don't.",

      "Researchers think they have debunked the origin of Chicago's so-called \u201crat hole,\u201d one of the Windy City's weirdest local landmarks.",
      "Hold on. The rat hole wasn't what you think. It wasn't some back alley bar that served as a speakeasy for the city's notorious gangster clientele or a tenement stuffed to the brim with junk. It was actually a full-body impression of an unlucky critter that got trapped in wet sidewalk cement in the city's Roscoe Village neighborhood about 20 or 30 years ago. The imprint closely resembles that of a spread-eagled rat, complete with outlines of what appear to be tiny claws, arms and legs and even a tail.",
      "The rat hole went viral early last year after comedian Winslow Dumaine posted a photo of it on X. The post drew curious tourists to the site at all hours, with some leaving coins and other odd objects around the impression as a tribute.",
      "The constant traffic drew complaints from neighbors, though, and in April 2024 someone filled the impression with a substance resembling plaster. City workers eventually removed that slab of sidewalk and took it to the City Hall-County Building. A plaque honoring the rat hole remains at the actual site.",
      "Researchers hailing from the University of Tennessee, New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine and the University of Calgary published a paper Wednesday in the journal Biology Letters that concludes the rat hole was most likely created not by the titular rodent but a squirrel or a muskrat.",

      "The researchers studied online photos of the rat hole and compared measurements of the imprint to museum specimens of animals commonly found in the Chicago area. The presence of arms, legs and a tail excluded birds, snakes, frogs and turtles, shrinking the possibilities to a mammal. The claw outlines further reduced the field to rats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and muskrats, the study said.",
      "The creature's long forelimbs, third digits and hind paws were too large for a rat but fell into the measurement ranges for Eastern gray squirrels, fox squirrels and muskrats. The most probable suspect is the Eastern gray squirrel given how abundant that creature is in the Chicago area, the study concluded.",
      "Other researchers have theorized that a squirrel created the imprint, the study acknowledged. Cement is typically wet during the day, and rats are nocturnal and the creature didn't leave any tracks, suggesting a squirrel misjudged a leap or slipped from a branch and landed in the wet cement, the study noted.",
      "The imprint didn't show any sign of a bushy tail, but hair often lacks the rigidity to create deep, well-defined impressions, and it would have been surprising to find such an imprint, the study said.",
      "\u201cWe therefore propose that the specimen be rechristened the 'Windy City Sidewalk Squirrel' \u2014 a name more fitting of its likely origins and more aligned with the evidence at hand,\" they wrote.",

      "Hong Kong lawmakers have passed a bill to regulate online ride-hailing services like Uber",
      "HONG KONG -- HONG KONG (AP) \u2014 Hong Kong lawmakers passed a bill Wednesday to regulate online ride-hailing services, requiring platforms like Uber, along with their vehicles and drivers, to be licensed, after years of backlash from the city's taxi industry.",
      "The first licensed platforms are expected to start operating in late 2026 at the earliest, officials said.",
      "In granting a license, Hong Kong's transport commissioner can consider the firm\u2019s experience, financial capacity and intended investments in the region. Licensed companies will need to maintain \u201cproper and efficient\u201d services and ensure all vehicles and drivers on their platforms hold valid permits, according to the new rules.",
      "Drivers are required to be at least 21, have held a private car driving license for at least one year and have no serious traffic convictions within five years. They also need to pass a test and take a pre-service course.",
      "The bill marks an important step in the development of ride-hailing services in Hong Kong, which currently bans drivers of private vehicles from providing paid services to customers without a permit.",
      "Uber Hong Kong welcomed the voting results. \u201cThis decision marks a significant milestone in integrating ridesharing into the city\u2019s transport system and ensuring riders and drivers benefit from clear rules,\u201d it said.",
      "Police have previously arrested some Uber drivers suspected of driving without a permit and in 2018, more than two dozen drivers were fined.",

      "Officials proposed a cap on the number of vehicles offering ride-hailing services under the new rules, which will be specified in a subsidiary legislation next year. If that legislation is passed, they will invite applications for licenses.",
      "Uber Hong Kong said it looked forward to \u201cconstructive discussions\u201d on vehicle quota mechanisms.",
      "Anyone who operates a ride-hailing platform and provides services without a license will face a fine of up to 1 million Hong Kong dollars (about $128,600) and a maximum jail term of one year, according to the bill.",
      "A platform that arranges cars or drivers without valid permits to serve passengers could be punished by a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of 10,000 Hong Kong dollars ($1,286) per violation on a first conviction. For subsequent conviction, the maximum jail term would double, in addition to a higher fine.",

Launched Tuesday under the name Humanity AI, the coalition is committing $500 million across the next five years to place human interests at the forefront of the technology's rapid integration into daily life.",
      "\u201cEvery day, people learn more about the ways AI is impacting their lives, and it can often feel like this technology is happening to us rather than with us and for us,\u201d MacArthur Foundation President John Palfrey said in a statement. \u201cThe stakes are too high to defer decisions to a handful of companies and leaders within them.\"",

But that openness, a long-standing practice celebrated for advancing knowledge, is raising alarms among some U.S. lawmakers.",

      "\u201cFor far too long, our adversaries have exploited American colleges and universities to advance their interests, while risking our national security and innovation,\u201d said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He has introduced legislation to put new restrictions on federally funded research collaboration with academics at several Chinese institutions that work with the Chinese military, as well as institutions in other countries deemed adversarial to U.S. interests.",

      "The rising concerns on Capitol Hill threaten to unravel deep, two-generations-old academic ties between the countries even as the world's two largest economies are moving away from each other through tariffs and trade barriers.

      "\"Foreign adversaries are increasingly exploiting the open and collaborative environment of U.S. academic institutions for their own gain,\u201d said James Cangialosi, director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which in August issued a bulletin urging universities to do more to protect research from foreign meddling.",
      "The House committee released three reports in September alone. They targeted, respectively, Pentagon-funded research involving military-linked Chinese scholars; joint U.S.-China institutes that train STEM talent for China; and visa policies that have brought military-linked Chinese students to Ph.D. programs at American universities. The reports recommend more legislation to protect U.S. research, tighter visa policies to vet Chinese students and scholars and an end to academic partnerships that could be exploited to boost China\u2019s military powers.",
      "More than 500 U.S. universities and institutes have collaborated with Chinese military researchers in recent years, helping Beijing develop advanced technologies with military applications, such as anti-jamming communications and hypersonic vehicles, according to a report by the private U.S. intelligence group Strider Technologies.",
      "Despite efforts in recent years by the U.S. government to set up guardrails to prevent such collaboration from boosting China\u2019s military capabilities, the practice is still prevalent, according to Strider, based in Salt Lake City, Utah.",
      "The report identified nearly 2,500 publications produced in collaboration between U.S. entities and Chinese military-affiliated research institutes in 2024 on STEM research, which includes physics, engineering, material science, computer science, biology, medicine and geology. While the number peaked at more than 3,500 in 2019, before some new restrictive measures came into effect, the level of collaboration remains high, the report said.",
      "This collaboration not only facilitates \u201cpotential illicit knowledge transfer,\u201d but supports China's \u201cstate-directed efforts to recruit top international talent, often to the detriment of U.S. national interests,\u201d the report said.",

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children\u2019s access to AI chatbots",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) \u2014 California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday vetoed landmark legislation that would have restricted children's access to AI chatbots.",
      "The bill would have banned companies from making AI chatbots available to anyone under 18 years old unless the businesses could ensure the technology couldn't engage in sexual conversations or encourage self-harm.",
      "\u201cWhile I strongly support the author's goal of establishing necessary safeguards for the safe use of AI by minors, (the bill) imposes such broad restrictions on the use of conversational AI tools that it may unintentionally lead to a total ban on the use of these products by minors,\u201d Newsom said.",
      "The veto came hours after he signed a law requiring platforms to remind users they are interacting with a chatbot and not a human. The notification would pop up every three hours for users who are minors. Companies will also have to maintain a protocol to prevent self-harm content and refer users to crisis service providers if they expressed suicidal ideation.",
      "Newsom, who has four children under 18, said California has a responsibility to protect kids and teens who are increasingly turning to AI chatbots for everything from help with homework to emotional support and personal advice.",
      "California is among several states that tried this year to address concerns surrounding chatbots used by kids for companionship. Safety concerns around the technology exploded following reports and lawsuits saying chatbots made by Meta, OpenAI and others engaged with young users in highly sexualized conversations and, in some cases, coached them to take their own lives.",
      "The two measures were among a slew of AI bills introduced by California lawmakers this year to rein in the homegrown industry that is rapidly evolving with little oversight. Tech companies and their coalitions, in response, spent at least $2.5 million in the first six months of the session lobbying against the measures, according to advocacy group Tech Oversight California. Tech companies and leaders in recent months also announced they are launching pro-AI super PACs to fight state and federal oversight.",
      "The youth AI chatbot ban would have applied to generative AI systems that simulate \u201chumanlike relationship\u201d with users by retaining their personal information and asking unprompted emotional questions. It would have allowed the state attorney general to seek a civil penalty of $25,000 per violation.",
      "James Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, said Newsom's veto of the bill was \u201cdeeply disappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis legislation is desperately needed to protect children and teens from dangerous \u2014 and even deadly \u2014 AI companion chatbots,\u201d he said.",
      "But the tech industry argued that the bill was so broad that it would stifle innovation and take away useful tools for children, such as AI tutoring systems and programs that could detect early signs of dyslexia.",
      "Steyer also said the notification law didn't go far enough, saying it \u201cprovides minimal protections for children and families.\"",

The Federal Trade Commission also launched an inquiry last month into several AI companies about the potential risks for children when they use chatbots as companions.",
      "Research by a watchdog group says chatbots have been shown to give kids dangerous advice about topics such as drugs, alcohol and eating disorders. The mother of a teenage boy in Florida who died by suicide after developing what she described as an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship with a chatbot has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Character.AI. And the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine recently sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman, alleging that ChatGPT coached the California boy in planning and taking his own life earlier this year.",
      "OpenAI and Meta last month announced changes to how their chatbots respond to teenagers asking questions about suicide or showing signs of mental and emotional distress.",
      "Meta said it is now blocking its chatbots from talking with teens about self-harm, suicide, disordered eating and inappropriate romantic conversations, and instead directs them to expert resources. Meta already offers parental controls on teen accounts.",

      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \u201cgenerally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\u201d wrote Kovacs.",
      "\u201cActing to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\u201d Kovacs said.",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel\u2019s asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \u201cdepressing litany of threats\u201d to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\u201cThe fact that 61% of the world\u2019s birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can\u2019t afford to ignore,\u201d Butchart said.",

      "The newly formed company, Liberty Vote, also vowed to follow the executive order Trump signed last spring seeking sweeping changes to election policies that multiple judges have put on hold for violating the Constitution.",
      "KNOWiNK, a St. Louis-based provider of electronic poll books that allow election officials to confirm voter information, announced the deal and the name change. In a possible nod to a groundless conspiracy theory that linked Dominion to the late Venezuelan dictator Hugo Chavez, the release highlighted that the company would become \u201c100% American-owned.\u201d",
      "The announcement also quotes KNOWiNK's owner, former St. Louis elections director Scott Leiendecker, as vowing to provide \u201celection technology that prioritizes paper-based transparency,\u201d one of the longtime demands of election conspiracy theorists.

      "The release from the new company vows to reintroduce \u201chand-marked paper ballots\u201d and adjust company policies to follow Trump's executive order on voting procedures, which is not in effect because judges have ruled that Trump doesn't have the power to mandate them. Part of the president's order sought to prohibit voting equipment that produces a paper record with \u201ca barcode or quick-response code\u201d \u2014 equipment that is currently in use in hundreds of counties across 19 states.",
      "Denver-based Dominion was at the heart of some of the most fevered conspiracy theories about Trump's loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election., Those false allegations sparked a number of defamation lawsuits against conservative-leaning media and the president's allies, including a settlement in 2023 in which Fox News agreed to pay Dominion $787 million and one this year that Newsmax settled for $67 million.",

      "AEP Transmission will upgrade power lines in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia, primarily to enhance enhance grid reliability and capacity, the Energy Department said. The project by AEP Transmission, a subsidiary of Ohio-based American Electric Power, is meant to help meet surging electricity demand from data centers and artificial intelligence.",
      "AEP primarily produces electricity from coal, natural gas and nuclear power, along with renewable resources such as wind and hydroelectric power.",
      "Thursday's announcement deepens the Trump administration\u2019s commitment to traditional, polluting energy sources even as it works to discourage the U.S. from clean energy use.",
      "The move comes as the Trump administration has moved to cancel $7.6 billion in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects in 16 states, all of which voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in last year\u2019s presidential election. A total of 223 projects were terminated after a review determined they did not adequately advance the nation\u2019s energy needs or were not economically viable, the Energy Department said.",
      "The cancellations include up to $1.2 billion for California\u2019s hydrogen hub aimed at producing clean-burning hydrogen fuels to power ships and heavy-duty trucks. A hydrogen project costing up to $1 billion in the Pacific Northwest also was cancelled.",
      "The loan guarantee finalized Thursday is the first offered by the Trump administration under the recently renamed Energy Dominance Financing program created by the massive tax-and-spending law approved this summer by congressional Republicans and signed by President Donald Trump. Electric utilities that receive loans through the program must provide assurances to the government that financial benefits from the financing will be passed on to customers, the Energy Department said.",
      "The project and others being considered will help ensure that Americans \"will have access to affordable, reliable and secure energy for decades to come,\u201d Energy Secretary Chris Wright said in a statement.",

      "The upgrades supported by the federal financing will replace existing transmission lines in existing rights-of-way with new lines capable of carrying more energy, the power company said.",

      "The storm brought record high water to two low-lying Alaska Native communities and washed away homes, some with people inside. At least one person was killed and two are missing. Makeshift shelters were quickly established and swelled to hold about 1,500 people, an extraordinary number in a sparsely populated region where communities are reachable only by air or water this time of year.",

      "Police in a handful of big cities have seen an increase in 3D printed guns over the last few years",
      "As police departments around the country report a surge in 3D-printed firearms turning up at crime scenes, gun safety advocates and law enforcement officials are warning that a new generation of untraceable weapons could soon eclipse the \u201cghost guns\u201d that have already flooded U.S. streets.",
      "At a summit in New York City on Thursday, the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety will bring together policymakers, academics, 3D-printing industry leaders and law enforcement officials to confront the growing challenge. They fear that as the printers become cheaper and more sophisticated \u2014 and blueprints for gun parts spread rapidly online \u2014 the U.S. could be on the brink of another wave of unregulated, homemade weapons that evade serial-number tracking and background checks.",
      "Numbers collected by Everytown from about two dozen police departments show how quickly the problem is growing: A little over 30 3D-printed guns were recovered in 2020. By 2024, that figure had climbed above 300. While still a fraction of the tens of thousands of firearms seized each year by the nation\u2019s nearly 18,000 police departments, the spike mirrors the early trajectory of ghost guns \u2014 build-it-yourself weapons assembled from kits that for years eluded federal regulation.",
      "\u201cWe are now starting to see what kind of feels very familiar,\u201d said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of law and policy at Everytown. \u201cIt\u2019s now at a small number of recoveries in certain major cities, such that it\u2019s doubling or tripling year over year. We\u2019re seeing this very familiar rate of growth and that\u2019s why we\u2019re getting this group together to discuss how to stop it.\u201d",
      "The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives imposed new rules in 2022 requiring serial numbers, background checks and age verification for ghost-gun kits, regulations upheld by the Supreme Court earlier this year. Lawsuits and state-level bans eventually pushed Polymer80, once the leading manufacturer of those kits, out of business in 2024.",
      "But 3D-printed weapons present a thornier problem. They aren\u2019t manufactured or sold through the firearms industry, and neither 3D-printer companies nor the cloud-based platforms that host gun blueprints fall under the ATF\u2019s authority. That leaves much of the prevention work to voluntary action and new legislation.",
      "In addition to seeking industry self regulations, the summit aims to bring together academics and policymakers to talk about possible legislative ways to address the issue such as creating statutes to criminalize manufacturing ghost guns or selling blueprints.",

      "\u2033So we reached out to YouTube and got their policies updated,\" Bragg said. \u201cIf we were just prosecuting gun possessions rather than thinking about how to prevent these guns from getting printed and proactively talking to these companies, then we would be sorely behind the curve.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Senate Democrats are poised for the 10th time Thursday to reject a stopgap spending bill that would reopen the government, insisting they won\u2019t back away from demands that Congress take up health care benefits.",
      "The repetition of votes on the funding bill has become a daily drumbeat in Congress, underscoring how intractable the situation has become as it has been at times the only item on the agenda for the Senate floor. House Republicans have left Washington altogether. The standoff has lasted over two weeks, leaving hundreds of thousands of federal workers furloughed, even more without a guaranteed payday and Congress essentially paralyzed.",
      "\u201cEvery day that goes by, there are more and more Americans who are getting smaller and smaller paychecks,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader John Thune, adding that there have been thousands of flight delays across the country as well.",
      "Thune, a South Dakota Republican, again and again has tried to pressure Democrats to break from their strategy of voting against the stopgap funding bill. It hasn't worked. And while some bipartisan talks have been ongoing about potential compromises on health care, they haven't produced any meaningful progress toward reopening the government.",
      "Democrats say they won't budge until they get a guarantee on extending subsidies for health plans offered under Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They warned that millions of Americans who buy their own health insurance \u2014 such as small business owners, farmers and contractors \u2014 will see large increases when premium prices go out in the coming weeks. Looking ahead to a Nov. 1 deadline in most states, they think voters will demand that Republicans enter into serious negotiations.",
      "\u201cWe have to do something, and right now, Republicans are letting these tax credits expire,\u201d said Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer.",
      "Still, Thune was also trying a different tack Thursday with a vote to proceed to appropriations bills \u2014 a move that could grease the Senate's wheels into some action or just deepen the divide between the two parties.",
      "Democrats have rallied around their priorities on health care as they hold out against voting for a Republican bill that would reopen the government. Yet they also warn that the time to strike a deal to prevent large increases for many health plans is drawing short.",

      "Democrats \u2014 and some Republicans \u2014 are worried that many of those people will forgo insurance if the price rises dramatically. While the tax credits don't expire until next year, health insurers will soon send out notices of the price increases. In most states, they go out Nov. 1.",

The state agency is using a \u201crapid DNA\u201d process that can develop a DNA profile in less than two hours, and starts with samples from family members to compare to any remains.",

That has created majority-Black and Latino districts that vote reliably Democratic in some of the nation's most conservative states.",

    "story": [
      "Jeremy Allen White becomes \"The Boss\" in a new film, channeling Bruce Springsteen's raw vulnerability during one of the most introspective chapters of his life.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning star of \"The Bear\" plays the lead role in \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" out Oct. 24. The biopic strips away the stadium rock legend to reveal a deeply human artist.",
      "\"I don't remember a time I didn't know the name Bruce Springsteen,\" White said.",
      "White had no experience singing or playing guitar before taking on the role, but that didn't stop director Scott Cooper \u2014 or Bruce Springsteen himself \u2014 from believing in him.",
      "After a call with Cooper, where White learned that Springsteen personally wanted him for the part, White said he felt an immediate sense of confidence. Knowing that Springsteen had seen his work and believed in his ability, he decided to take a leap of faith and fully commit to the transformation.",
      "Preparing for the role meant months of intense training, from vocal work to learning guitar. White said he found unexpected confidence through the music itself.",
      "\"I sang his songs over and over and over again,\" he said.",
      "Springsteen served as an important resource throughout the project. White said their conversations went beyond the film itself, touching on personal experiences and emotional challenges. During one discussion, Springsteen shared a story about a road trip and a moment at a county fair when he suffered a panic attack. He described feeling detached, as if he were merely observing his own life, a realization that deeply resonated with White, who had faced similar feelings himself.",
      "Through those exchanges, Springsteen encouraged White to bring his own emotions and perspective to the role, allowing him to fully inhabit the character with authenticity and vulnerability.",
      "One of the most meaningful exchanges came when Springsteen gave White something invaluable: freedom.",
      "\"One of the most beautiful things he did was really give me permission to bring myself to it,\" White said.",
      "Capturing the humanity behind \"The Boss\"",
      "Cooper shaped the story around the creation of Springsteen's \"Nebraska\" album, a period the musician described as one of the darkest in his life. The film explores his battles with depression and his complicated relationship with his father, who suffered from schizophrenia.",
      "Springsteen remained closely involved in the production, visiting the set several times but allowing the filmmakers full creative space. Cooper said his presence was supportive rather than intrusive and said that Springsteen made it clear he would step back if needed. White recalled being aware that Springsteen was on set but said it never broke his focus.",
      "Springsteen later praised White for his performance, calling it \"a deeply intuitive, psychological portrait\" of his younger self, a compliment that left the actor stunned.",
      "\"I still can't believe, you know, I don't know. I still can't believe we got started. I can't believe he gave our blessing in the first place,\" White said.",
      "Premiering at the Telluride Film Festival, the film earned praise from psychologists for its emotional depth and its potential to spark conversations about mental health, especially among men.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/grand-sumo-tournament-london-second-time-outside-japan/",
    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 07:08:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The Grand Sumo Tournament is rumbling London's iconic Royal Albert Hall in a rare foreign foray for Japan's centuries-old sport.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or Rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobisdashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rishiki from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rishiki competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimirate, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rishiki is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rishiki on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onasato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

    "story": [
      "For 14 years, Donnie Wahlberg starred as Detective Danny Reagan on the CBS police procedural \"Blue Bloods.\" The hit drama about the Reagans, the fictional first family of the New York Police Department, had a loyal following. \"I was stopped on airplanes, on trains, on the street, at basketball \u2013 you name it. Wherever I was, somebody would tell me they love 'Blue Bloods,'\" said Wahlberg.",
      "Now 56, Wahlberg is sitting at a new family's dinner table, in \"Boston Blue,\" a \"Blue Bloods\" spinoff set in a city the actor knows well.",
      "Wahlberg grew up the eighth of nine kids in the working-class Boston neighborhood of Dorchester. \"We were poor,\" he said. \"There were nine kids, a dog, a cat, and a grandma in the basement, and my mom and dad for a while. There were kids coming and going, running away, being arrested. There were arguments, fights, alcohol. I definitely learned from some of my older siblings that, here's a clear path of what not to do.\"",
      "Wahlberg says he was the family peacemaker. \"I don't like to use the term ('cause I don't wanna insult my other siblings), but one of the adults. My role was to get everyone together and be happy by any means necessary.\"",
      "The discord wasn't just inside the house; 1970s Boston was a cauldron of racial tension. A controversial court-ordered desegregation program bussed students to schools outside their neighborhoods. As a first grader, Wahlberg was sent from Irish-Catholic Dorchester to predominantly Black Roxbury.",
      "He describes it as \"probably the most important thing that ever happened in my life.\"",
      "Because? \"Because I don't know what I would've not been exposed to, had I not been on those buses. In my neighborhood, if I woulda said, 'Yeah, I wanna be a singer one day,' I could think of five kids in the neighborhood who would punch me in the face. And two of them lived in my house!\"",
      "It was after hearing hip hop in the fourth grade that Wahlberg caught the performing bug. \"I would listen to 'Rapper's Delight,' I just would start writing my own raps and making up my own songs,\" he said.",
      "That helped Wahlberg earn an audition, at just 14 years old, with Maurice Starr, the local impresario who'd founded New Edition and was starting a new band. \"Maurice was looking for the equivalent of the Osmonds to the Jacksons,\" he said.",
      "What did his parents think? \"My mom was super supportive,\" he recalled. \"And I said, 'Dad, I'm gonna start this music band.' And he said, 'Well, I tell ya' what: If you ever do make it big, and you come home, and you've changed, I'm gonna kick your ass.'\"",
      "In 1984, Donnie and his younger brother Mark became the first two members of New Kids on the Block. But the family affair was short-lived, as Mark quit. \"He didn't like singing,\" said Donnie. \"He couldn't sing.\u00a0 There's a scene of him as Dirk Diggler in 'Boogie Nights' singing horribly. That's actually better than he sang as a member of New Kids!\"",
      "With four other members in place (including some of Wahlberg's schoolmates), the group struggled at first to find its footing. But by the late 1980s, they appeared to have the right stuff:",
      "While the band was popular, it was far from critics' choice. \"I really struggled with the criticism of the band \u2013 we couldn't sing, we were puppets, we were fake,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "To feel better about himself, Wahlberg focused on writing and producing, not just for the New Kids, but also for his brother Mark. Soon enough they had a #1 hit, \"Good Vibrations.\"",
      "Donnie said, \"Marky Mark and my brother's career and his music was really when I started to get my head screwed on right of how I could really prove myself.\"",
      "Prove himself \u2026 and protect his kid brother. \"My brother was getting in trouble and my mom was like, 'You gotta help your brother and get him out of the streets,'\" said Wahlberg. \"I don't like to wear the Marky Mark and my brother's career as some kind of badge of honor. He worked very hard for his career. But I really did, you know, help him in a big way, and helped myself in a big way in doing that.\"",
      "After the New Kids broke up in 1994, Wahlberg turned to acting, breaking through in \"The Sixth Sense.\" Other roles followed, including \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Boomtown,\" along with reunions for New Kids on the Block, which still keep him busy.",
      "Wahlberg now lives outside Chicago, in a home he shares with his second wife, TV personality Jenny McCarthy.",
      "\"We have very similar upbringings, which really helps,\" said McCarthy. \"I think we're both people-pleasers, which could also be bad if you're not in therapy about it!\"",
      "\"Lotta therapy we've each had, and together,\" said Wahlberg.",
      "\"But we're caretakers, you know, of our family, which I think is something to be proud of,\" McCarthy added.",
      "They may now live in McCarthy's hometown, but Boston is never far from Wahlberg's heart, as evident in his home office, which features mementoes from Bill Belichick, Bill Russell and Larry Bird.",
      "And then there's his new show which he wasn't sure he wanted to do after \"Blue Bloods\"' cancellation. \"I love 'Blue Bloods,'\" he said. \"I fought tooth-and-nail to keep it on the air. And here's an opportunity to keep this character alive. And suddenly, when I started to look at it through that lens, it was like, how do I not do this? If all those millions of 'Blue Bloods' fans don't show up and love it, then I know we put our best foot forward.\"",
      "Between his TV work and concerts, it's a busy life for Donnie Wahlberg. \"People say to me, 'Oh, gosh, when do you sleep?' You want me to complain? Everything I ever wanted, I'm doing it. I wanna work harder, I want to be worthy of it. I want to be worthy of \u2026 the gift that so many people give me of their time. How can I not work my ass off to repay that?\"",
      "But he says he's just doing what he's always done: \"My childhood was spent trying to bring joy and love to a large group of people amidst chaos and confusion and pain. And it's what I do for a living right now.\u00a0 It's what I've grown up to do.\"",

      "Asbury Park is a Jersey beach town with heart, history and harmony, not to mention a voice. Bruce Springsteen's presence can still be felt in his old haunts \u2013 the Stone Pony, the Wonder Bar, Madam Marie's. The town's welcome mat is its storied boardwalk, where we met Jeremy Allen White. \"There's a lot of romance here still, I feel like,\" said White, who was thinking about his own hometown.",
      "\"Do you feel that way a little bit about Brooklyn?\" I asked.",
      "\"I do, yeah. I always feel at home there.\"",
      "Had that Brooklyn boy come out here, say, three years ago, he might have been just another tourist. But not anymore. His turn as the talented but tormented chef on the award-winning FX series \"The Bear\" has made the 34-year-old one of the hottest commodities in Hollywood.",
      "I said, \"Early on, it strikes me that if you were just to read the script, it was kind of just a story about a sandwich shop.\"",
      "\"It was a hard thing to explain,\" said White, \"and it sounded something like that, you know? Yes, this, like, kid, he comes back, he's a chef, and he's, like, opening a sandwich shop. And I saw my friends trying to be nice and say, Oh, that sounds great, you know?\"",
      "He ended up sweeping nearly all of the awards: Emmys, Golden Globes, Screen Actors Guild, Critics Choice. His two young daughters call them his \"trophy winners cups.\" \"They like them, they get a kick out of it, but they also are very honest and there's just like, Why do you get all these things?\" White said.",
      "Back out at the Jersey shore, it's not those past awards that matter. It's the ones that might be coming down the Jersey Turnpike for White's performance as Springsteen himself.",
      "And yes, that really is White's voice. He said, \"If you're gonna do one thing to get it right, you have to perform to the point of exhaustion. 'Cause he continues until he cannot go any longer.",
      "\"Everybody's got their own idea of Bruce Springsteen. And I think at the beginning, I was approaching it like, how am I going to make everybody happy? That's a fool's errand. It's an impossibility.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment that you thought to yourself, Yeah, I got this. I can do this?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, I don't think so,\" White replied. \"There were moments where I found confidence, but I always wanted more, I wanted more time, I wanted to go deeper.\"",
      "Springsteen was aware of White before the film. He had seen and admired the emotional complexity in his work, and that's a well Springsteen knew whoever played him needed to have. White said, \"Bruce has gone on record and said, you know, I have no problem performing for three hours on stage. That's easy for me. I know exactly who I am on stage. You know, it's the other 21 hours that I have trouble with.\"",
      "\"Did you know any of that before you really took a deep dive?\" I asked.",
      "\"I mean, I was familiar enough with his music that, you know, I understood his depth, and I understood, you know, we're dealing with a man who's looked over the edge before, absolutely,\" said White. \"But, no.\"",
      "The film, \"Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere,\" based on the book of the same name, follows the making of the 1982 album \"Nebraska.\" Some say it's Springsteen as his best, but he himself may have actually been at his worst.",
      "In his 2016 autobiography, \"Born to Run,\" he describes an emotional breakdown while at a Texas county fair, not long after \"Nebraska\" was finished:",
      "\"I've just pulled a perfect swan dive into my abyss; my stomach is on rinse cycle, and I'm going down, down, down. I just feel a need to get rooted somewhere, before I drift into ether.\"",
      "White said, \"I asked him, what's that panic about? You know, what is that fear inside of you? And he said, 'I had this moment where I felt like an outsider and observer in my own life.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Have you ever struggled with mental illness yourself?\"",
      "\"Yeah, of course,\" said White. \"When he told me about that, that feeling of being an observer of your own life, that was very familiar to me. I remember when I found acting, there was a lot of like, I think like, chaos and confusion, just a lot going on. I couldn't focus on myself. And I found acting, and I found some peace and I found some focus.\"",
      "White has drawn from that emotional trough as early as he can remember, even during his days of doing crime dramas on TV, when he was looking for certain things \u2013 not just a job. \"Yeah, you know, I was very lucky, I was a kid, so my first agents were kind of confused and upset with me for kind of, like, having a standard for what I would go audition for,\" he said. \"I'd never done anything before when I was 13, and they were like, Just go on the audition, you know?\"",
      "One of those auditions landed him on \"Shameless.\" For 11 seasons he played bad boy, big brother, and brainiac Lip Gallagher.",
      "His unruly hair and blue eyes got him counted among the so-called \"rodent men\" - a term used to describe a few of the most physically desirable things a man can be these days. His Calvin Klein underwear ad certainly helped.",
      "Before we left the shore, we stopped by the Stone Pony, where White tried to re-create on film Springsteen's early glory days.",
      "\"Bruce was there, like he was a lot of days, and he came out, and he kind of introduced me to the audience, so he gave them to me all warmed up,\" White recalled. \"They made me feel like a star for three-and-a-half minutes. And then the first A.D. would say 'Cut,' and they would go silent. And I remembered, I am not Bruce Springsteen, I am just an actor!\"",
      "A guy from Brooklyn playing a guy from Jersey \u2013 they both seem to understand one another, and neither would change a thing.",
      "White said, \"The ride is fun, but I'm, you know, I'm filled up. I just want to work with people I admire and be able to keep doing what I love to do. That's what's important to me.\"",
      "I asked, \"So, if all the fame and success ended after this film, you'd feel like ...?\"",
      "\"Can I still work?\"",
      "\"Yeah.\"",
      "\"Then, yeah, I'm okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.\"",

      "Additional information was not immediately available. Keaton's family, which has not responded to CBS News' inquiries, has not released a statement, and is not planning to today, according to Rath.",
      "People Magazine, which first reported Keaton's death, said the actress died in California on Saturday, Oct. 11, citing a family spokesperson.",
      "An actress for more than four decades, the beloved star thought she would be a singer, telling\u00a0\"CBS Sunday Morning\" in February 2010, \"I wanted to sing. I did everything I could to be a singer.\"",
      "Born in 1946 in Los Angeles, Keaton appeared on the stage in the musical \"Hair\" at 22 years old and then in Woody Allen's \"Play It Again, Sam\" in 1968, for which she would receive a Tony nomination.",
      "Keaton said her voice wasn't good enough, and she moved on to acting, making her first film appearance in \"Lovers and Other Strangers\" in 1970, while her many early TV credits include appearances on \"Mannix,\" \"The F.B.I.,\" \"Night Gallery,\" and \"Love, American Style.\"",
      "She starred as Al Pacino's girlfriend Kay in \"The Godfather\" in 1972 and repeated the role in the crime saga's two sequels. The couple became romantically involved after the filming of The Godfather Part II, Keaton said.",
      "Keaton then became well-known for a string of movies she did with famed director Woody Allen \u2014 starting one of the 70s most enduring screen partnerships. She starred in \"Manhattan,\" \"Annie Hall,\" and \"Love and Death, among others.",
      "She said she had a \"huge crush\" on Allen right from the moment she saw him.",
      "\"He was hilarious,\" Keaton told \"CBS News Sunday Morning.\"",
      "She was also romantically linked to Warren Beatty, who directed her and with whom she co-starred in \"Reds.\"",
      "Keaton won her first Oscar for \"Annie Hall\" \u2014 an exceptionally rare win for a comic performance \u2014 at the 50th Annual Academy Awards and would go on to be nominated three more times, for \"Reds,\" \"Marvin's Room,\" and \"Something's Gotta Give.\"",
      "Keaton never married and didn't start a family until she was 50, saying she was \"a late developer.\"\u00a0 Keaton said if she got married, she would've had to \"compromise too much.\"",
      "She said she wanted to try more adventurous things for herself and also said she was \"afraid of men.\" She said she was always being turned down and overlooked. \"I wasn't marriage material.\"",
      "She adopted two children when she was in her 50s: a daughter, Dexter, and a son, Duke.\u00a0 Keaton said she really enjoyed being a daughter and didn't embrace parenthood until after her father died.",

      "\"[Keaton] was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star,\" Midler, who starred alongside Keaton in \"The First Wives Club,\" wrote on Instagram. \"What you saw was who she was...oh, la, lala!\"",
      "Kimberly Williams-Paisley, who played Keaton's daughter in \"Father of the Bride,\" said working with the legendary actress will always be one of the highlights of her life.",
      "\"You are one of a kind, and it was thrilling to be in your orbit for a time. Thank you for your kindness, your generosity, your talent, and above all, your laughter,\" she wrote.",

      "\"An icon of style, humor and comedy. Brilliant. What a person,\" Still wrote.",
      "Nancy Sinatra, actor, singer and the daughter of Frank Sinatra, said she adored and idolized Keaton.",
      "\"She was a very special person and an incredibly gifted actor, who made each of her roles unforgettable. Her light will continue to shine through the art she leaves behind,\" she said. \"Godspeed, Diane. My heart goes out to her family and to each of us grieving this heartbreaking loss.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 11 Oct 2025 10:24:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The owners and operators of independent cinemas are working to adapt as audience habits change.",
    "story": [
      "Audiences have been enjoying films at movie theaters for decades, but streaming and expensive\u00a0ticket prices\u00a0have impacted\u00a0moviegoing habits. For the owners and operators of independent theaters, survival means getting creative.",
      "Kevin Smith, the man behind cult classics like \"Clerks\" and \"Mallrats,\" bought a theater in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, in 2022. It was the cinema he'd gone to growing up. He renamed it Smodcastle Cinemas, and hoped that even as it reeled from COVID-19 shutdowns, he could rekindle the magic he'd loved as a child.",
      "\"I learned more about myself sitting in this (theater) than I ever did sitting in a classroom or sitting in church or something like that, and it led me to the rest of my life,\" Smith said.",
      "But the reality of operating the movie theater was difficult, even for a celebrity like Smith. They operate as a non-profit, Smith said, because if they functioned as a for-profit business, they \"would die.\" Smith can bring in celebrity guests for Q&A sessions and other events. The theater also hosts an annual film festival.",
      "\"Saving my childhood theater with my friends? Dream come true, worst financial investment I ever made in my life,\" Smith said.",
      "On the opposite coast, film store Vidiots has been bringing new movies to audiences for 40 years. When it opened in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, in 1985, it operated as a traditional video store with an extensive and rare collection of films. In 2023, Vidiots moved to Eagle Rock and expanded into an exhibition space, reviving the historic Eagle Theater.",
      "\"We opened to uncertainty,\" said executive director Maggie MacKay. \"We had no idea if people would come, and they did. And they've been coming ever since.\"",
      "MacKay said Vidiots has become a touchstone for local kids.",
      "\"One of the biggest surprises and the happiest surprises for us and the thing that I think I most wanted to happen here is that young people come here,\" she said. \"Teens, tweens are getting dropped off by their parents. And because this place is affordable and welcoming and nonjudgmental and safe, they are coming here all the time. We've got kids growing up here who call the video store their video store. We have a kid who calls it 'my video store.' That kid has no idea that that is a very unique thing to say in the 2020s.\"",
      "Like Smodcastle, Vidiots operates as a non-profit. That isn't the only path to success for these kinds of theaters, though, as New York City's Metrograph proves. The two-screen theater in Manhattan's Lower East Side shows international and arthouse fare and operates as a for-profit. Business is booming, CEO Christian Grass said, with the theater recently enjoying its best summer on record.",
      "\"People love going to the movies and people love the experience,\" Grass said. The theater also has a bookstore, a magazine, a streaming service, an extravagant concession stand and a swanky bar and restaurant. The establishment has focused on building a sense of community, said Metrograph director of programming Inge de Leeuw, which ensures people keep coming back. MacKay said she's also found people are looking for connection, community and a place they can go.",
      "\"Everybody wants movies in their lives, whether they know it or realize it or not,\" MacKay said. \"To save this thing, you have to make available every point of access for it. You have to make a return to a social experience.\"",
      "While independent theaters are taking different paths to success, they have one thing in common: They want to keep introducing new and classic films to audiences.",
      "\"You want to learn something about somebody, sit in the darkness and watch movies with them,\" Smith said. \"You will learn a lot about a person. You'll find out if they're empathetic. You'll find out what makes them laugh. You'll find out if there's a real human being there, if there's a heart underneath that all, man.\""

      "Washington \u2014 A scientist laid off by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said \"the everyday American should be very concerned\" by reductions in force amid the government shutdown.",
      "The scientist, one of hundreds of CDC employees terminated by the Trump administration last week, asked that her identity be concealed for fear of retribution.",
      "\"It's going to mean more deaths, more preventable deaths,\" she told CBS News on Wednesday of the layoffs. \"People will absolutely die from the impact of this administration.\"",
      "The scientist worked at the CDC for the past decade, studying chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.",
      "She spoke out the same day a federal judge in Northern California issued a verbal order temporarily halting all the government layoffs that were issued since the shutdown began. This was in response to a lawsuit brought by federal employees' unions.",
      "\"They went in and fired entire programs, even statutorily mandated by law programs, they cut entirely,\" she said. \"So there is no staff to do this work anymore.\"",
      "She said everything she was working on has come to a complete stop.",
      "\"It's truly like an episode of 'Squid Games,' because we don't know what's going to happen next,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has used the government shutdown, now in its third week, to lay off more than 4,000 federal workers, and plans to go further, according to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said Wednesday during an appearance on \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"",
      "Since last week, the Trump administration has informed approximately 600 CDC employees they have been laid off.",
      "On Tuesday, internal CDC officials not authorized to speak to the media told CBS News that on Oct. 10, about 1,000 CDC employees were initially given reduction-in-force notices, a government term for layoffs.",
      "However, within about 24 hours, hundreds of those notices were rescinded, reducing the total number of layoffs in the agency since Oct. 10 to about 600, the officials said.",
      "The judge's ruling Wednesday would put the layoffs of those 600 employees on hold, leaving them in limbo while the case plays out.",
      "According to numbers provided by a congressional source familiar with the cuts, the 600 CDC layoffs impacted all staff in the CDC's offices in Washington, D.C., all staff for the office of the director for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, all staff for the National Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Infrastructure and Workforce, and all policy and communications staff for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.",
      "The CDC agencies that saw their layoffs rescinded, according to the source, were the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Center, the Global Health Center, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report team, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and scientists working on responses to outbreaks of measles in the U.S. and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "So far this year, the CDC has lost about 3,000 employees to resignations and layoffs, or just under a quarter of its staff, according to AFGE Local 2883, the union that represents CDC employees. That number was confirmed by the CDC officials who spoke to CBS News.",
      "The CDC has been beset by changes since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the reins of the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year. A vaccine skeptic, Kennedy controversially replaced all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "And in August, less than a month after being confirmed by the Senate as CDC director, Susan Monarez was fired from her post over what she said was pressure from Kennedy to rubber-stamp his vaccine directives, later testifying before the Senate that Kennedy's demands were \"inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official.\" Her firing also prompted several top CDC officials to resign in protest.",
      "Kennedy, in his own Senate testimony last month, denied that he pressured Monarez to preapprove vaccination recommendations. He told senators that when he asked Monarez if she was \"a trustworthy person,\" she responded, \"no.\"",
      "The congressional source also confirmed that among the permanent layoffs in HHS last week were 41 people in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency under the U.S. Public Health Service whose staff works in biodefense, as well as monitors data on natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and cyberattacks on hospitals.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that the department's layoffs are part of an effort to cut a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and that the positions were deemed \"non-essential by their respective divisions.\"",
      "\"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "But the scientist who spoke to CBS News said the turmoil inside the CDC will impact responses to disease outbreaks, like the measles outbreak in South Carolina, where five new cases were reported Tuesday, bringing the total to 16 since July, and forcing 139 students into quarantine, according to health officials.",
      "\"The surge capacity of the CDC is going to be significantly hampered with these cuts,\" the scientist told CBS News. \"It's going to impede our ability to respond to public health outbreaks, just when all of these threats are on the rise.\""

    "summary": "Americans have received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls per month from January to September, the highest level in six years, PIRG found.",
    "story": [
      "Americans receive tens of millions of unsolicited automated calls and texts each day, often intended to dupe them into forking over personal information or money.",
      "That's the thrust of a new report by U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization, which found that scam and telemarketing calls and texts have proliferated across the country, despite safeguards intended to prevent them. (Of the 9,242 phone companies that filed with the FCC as of Sept. 28, 2025, less than half have installed robocall-fighting software.)",
      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose\u00a016% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

      "The fake SCOTUS letter prompted an Oct. 8 warning from the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General, cautioning the program's 75 million beneficiaries to be on alert if they receive a purported letter from the nation's highest court.",
      "While the warning didn't disclose how many Social Security recipients have been targeted by the fraud, the watchdog group said the hoax marks the evolution of government imposter scams, such as the decade-old scheme in which criminals\u00a0pretend to be IRS officials\u00a0informing their target victims that they're under investigation for tax fraud. The threat of an IRS probe has long been used by scammers to scare individuals into providing money or private data such as Social Security numbers.",
      "In this latest version of the same scheme, fraudsters are impersonating Supreme Court justices, rather than IRS officials. The new scam relies on multiple points of contact, with a fake letter followed by a text or call from the fraudsters, making it appear more authentic, said John Haraburda, Transaction Network Services (TNS) robocall data expert and director of product management.",
      "\"The fraudsters get very, very smart,\" Haraburda said. \"They do the mailing, then they'll send you a text from the number they're going to use for the phone call saying, 'This is the Social Security Administration \u2014 we're going to be calling you from this number in a few seconds.'\"",
      "He added, \"Then you've got this text message in a way authenticating the call that's coming in. That lets you break down your hesitation, to basically drop your guard.\"",
      "According to the Social Security Inspector General, the scam letter is personally addressed to the would-be victim, warning that they're a suspect in connection with legal proceedings and criminal charges. It also falsely claims their Social Security number has been compromised.",
      "The fake letter goes on to say that the Supreme Court has requested financial institutions to freeze the recipient's assets, and urges them to cooperate with \"the U.S. Treasury Department,\" the watchdog agency said.",
      "\"The letter ominously closes by stating, should the recipient encounter any difficulties in safeguarding assets, the recipient will bear full liability for any losses incurred following the suspension of their SSN,\" the SSA's inspector general said. \"Scammers most likely will follow up with text messages or telephone calls.\"",
      "Scammers may follow up with a text that includes a link to a fake Social Security site, which will capture the victim's login and password as they attempt to gain access to their accounts, or might ask for credit card info, Haraburda said.",

      "\"On every level, this letter is completely false,\" Michelle L. Anderson, acting inspector general at the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General said in a statement. \"These criminals are falsely accusing an individual of a crime and using federal agencies and federal officials to try to scare and legitimize their scam \u2014 if you get this type of letter, rip it up and report it.\""

    "summary": "More than 3,000 U.K. claimants accuse U.S. pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson of knowingly selling asbestos-tainted talcum powder, making them ill.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Thousands of people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim estimated to be worth more than \u00a31 billion ($1.34 billion) against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of selling baby powder that it knew was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos.",
      "The claim involves more than 3,000 people who developed various forms of cancer and other diseases and is based on internal Johnson & Johnson memos and scientific reports.",
      "The company has long fought thousands of similar cases in the United States, and despite winning some appeals, in June last year it agreed to pay $700 million in a nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",
      "Just last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered the firm to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from a form of cancer after using J&J products.",
      "The U.K. lawsuit, which covers the years 1965 to 2023, claims that Johnson & Johnson, \"knew their talc products contained carcinogenic fibres, including asbestos, for more than fifty years and chose to keep it on the market in pursuit of profit.\"",
      "Despite the alleged knowledge of the carcinogens in its products, the firm only took its talcum powder products off shelves in Britain in 2023, the suit alleges, when it switched to a cornstarch based product \u2014 three years after doing so in Canada and the U.S.",
      "\"For decades Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,\" said the claimants' lead lawyer, Tom Longstaff of KP Law, which has brought the case against J&J and Kenvue Ltd., which was spun off two years ago, before the U.K. High Court. \"The facts are clear, contaminated talc contains carcinogenic material and Johnson & Johnson knew the risk to consumers.\"",
      "\"The scale of Johnson & Johnson's corporate wrongdoing is extraordinary, and we will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions,\" Longstaff said.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",
      "By the 1980s, it was widely accepted that all forms of asbestos were dangerous and could cause cancer, but Johnson & Johnson \u2014   and other firms \u2014   successfully lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to not regulate asbestos content in talc, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In 2018, the FDA finally began testing talcum powder and other related products for asbestos. A year later, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew a batch of its powder after the FDA found asbestos fibers in a sample.",
      "The U.K. claims will be decided by a judge, rather than a jury, at the U.K. High Court's Manchester Circuit Commercial Court.",
      "In a statement, Kenvue said it believes the judge will find that its talc-based powder did not cause cancer.",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the attribution of the statement from Kenvue Ltd. to BBC News and to note that it is a separate company from J&J, not a subsidiary."

    "summary": "The U.S. government shut down on Wednesday after Congress failed to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",

      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",

      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers.

    "summary": "Some people taking out a home loan and purchasing flood insurance could face delays during the U.S. government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Americans worried that the U.S. government shutdown could derail their plans to take out a mortgage or refinance their home loan can breathe easy \u2014 mostly. Housing experts says lenders will continue processing mortgages as usual even if federal agencies close shop, while noting that a shutdown could lead to hitches for borrowers applying for government-backed loans.",
      "\"If you're expecting to close in a week or a month, there could be some slight delay,\" said Jeff Ostrowski, a housing analyst at Bankrate. \"But I think for most people, it's probably going to be a blip more than a real deal killer.\"",
      "The bulk of the mortgage market consists of loans originated by private lenders. But some government agencies have a hand in the process, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insuring private loans or Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) managing flood insurance policies.",
      "Impact on government-backed loans",
      "Borrowers applying for a conventional mortgage issued by a bank, credit union or other private lender are unlikely to encounter problems if the government closes shop. However, those applying for government-backed loans from agencies like the FHA, Department of Veteran Affairs an Department of Agriculture (USDA) could face minor delays lining up their mortgages, Holden Lewis, a senior writer at NerdWallet, told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "The National Association of Realtors (NAR) notes in an online\u00a0explainer\u00a0that the FHA will continue to approve most single-family mortgage loans in the event of a shutdown. The VA will also continue to guarantee home loans, but worker furloughs at the agency could lead to processing delays, the group said.",
      "\"It creates a little bit of extra stress and uncertainty, but I haven't seen a shutdown in either of those programs\" when politics led the government to shut it doors in the past, Ostrowski said.",
      "The VA and FHA account for up to a quarter of all mortgage applications, according to\u00a0Redfin. NAR\u00a0advises\u00a0U.S. veterans applying for or refinancing a government-backed loan to check with their lender on how long it will take to complete the process if the government shuts down.",
      "Another segment of the housing market that could feel the impact of the shutdown are people applying for mortgages through the USDA, which issues loans to buyers in eligible towns and rural areas. NAR\u00a0said the USDA will halt issuance of new direct and guaranteed home loans during a shutdown. Pre-scheduled direct\u2011loan closings will also be postponed.",
      "The USDA did not respond to a request for comment. The VA referred CBS News to its shutdown contingency plan, which says the agency will continue issuing \"housing benefits.\"",
      "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored entities that support roughly 70% of the mortgage market, don't rely on federal funding and have continued to operate during past shutdowns. However, they could face bottlenecks if federal agencies close down this week, said Anthony Smith, an applied economist at Realtor.com.",
      "\"They rely on other federal processes like the IRS for tax transcript verifications,\" he said. \"So if the IRS shuts down or significantly cuts back on its transcript services, then Fannie and Freddie might be able to approve a loan, but they can't get the final verification piece.\"",
      "Possible flood insurance delays",
      "People purchasing a house in a flood zone could also face delays during a government shutdown, experts told CBS News. That's because homebuyers applying for a federally backed mortgage in high-risk flood areas are required to get flood insurance. A shutdown could hamper the FEMA-administered National Flood Insurance Program, which underwrites more than 4 million flood insurance policies in the U.S.",
      "\"The government shutdown could complicate your closing because it might be harder to just secure flood insurance,\" Ostrowski told CBS News.",
      "FEMA did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "According to the White House, the flood insurance program cannot sell new or renewal insurance policies during a government shutdown.\"A potential lapse of the NFIP authorization would negatively impact many thousands of Americans who would be left unable to renew/transfer their coverage or to buy the required coverage for their homes,\" a White House official said in an email."

      "He also alluded to the air traffic control staffing issues and highlighted the wider impact of just a few people not showing up for work. \"If you have a few controllers that call in sick, it will ricochet through the airspace, and we have delays because we are not overstaffed,\" he said, adding that controllers are \"incredibly frustrated\" by the shutdown.",
      "Sheldon Jacobson, an aviation security expert and professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said flight delays stemming from controller shortages are inconvenient, but do not point to a safety risk for travelers.",
      "\"I don't think safety is being compromised, but service is definitely being compromised,\" Jacobson told CBS News.",
      "Still, Laura Einsetler, a captain for a U.S. airline, worries that a prolonged government shutdown could eventually affect the performance of air traffic controllers as they work without pay.",
      "\"How long can they go until they are distracted with stress about how they're going to pay for rent, their mortgage or put food on table for their families?\" she told CBS News. \"The more they don't get paid, the more distractions there are, and that raises the safety threat from a performance point of view.\"",
      "Trusting pilots",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, said some anxiety around hopping on a plane during the government shutdown is understandable. \"A lot of us have an innate fear of being 30,000 feet above the ground, so any justification we can find for why flying might be more risky now is understandable,\" he said.",
      "But he emphasized that pilots have final say on whether it is unsafe to fly for whatever reason, including poor weather, mechanical problems or staffing shortages.",
      "\"They are entrusted to give that last line of authority and say things are safe to fly, and they are in constant communication with air traffic control, monitoring weather systems, and what the entire flying environment looks like,\" Keyes said.",
      "\"The risk of delays and cancellations is higher today than it was before, but I don't think that translates into a higher risk of safety accidents,\" he added.",
      "Harteveldt agreed that airline pilots \u2014 who aren't federal employees \u2014 wouldn't take off given any safety concerns.",
      "\"When a plane departs the gate, it's the airline pilot inspecting the plane and saying, 'Yes, this plane is clear to go.' FAA inspectors, or the shutdown, have nothing to do with that,\" he said.",
      "Airlines for America, a lobbying group representing major airlines, last week sought to reassure the public that flying during the shutdown is safe, while acknowledging that control tower staffing shortages could lead to delays.",
      "\"It is safe to fly, but ATC staffing shortages strain the system and cause flights to be spaced out, slowing down everything. In some cases, flights may be delayed or even cancelled,\" the group said in a statement. \"The bottom line is that anyone heading to the airport right now is encouraged to pack their patience.\""

      "That included making \"hard but necessary decisions to reduce headcount,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "States are battling for their piece of $50 billion in federal rural health funding, but it's not just hospitals vying for the money. Tech startups and policy demands are raising the stakes as Medicaid cuts loom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Nationwide, states are racing to win their share of a new $50 billion rural health fund. But helping rural hospitals, as originally envisioned, is quickly becoming a quaint idea.",
      "Rather, states should submit applications that \"rebuild and reshape\" how health care is delivered in rural communities, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services official Abe Sutton said late last month during a daylong meeting at D.C.'s Watergate Hotel. Simply changing the way government pays hospitals has been tried and has failed, Sutton told the audience of more than 40 governors' office staffers and state health agency leaders \u2014 some from as far away as Hawaii.",
      "\"This isn't a backfill of operating budgets,\" said Sutton, CMS' innovation director. \"We've been really clear on that.\"",
      "Rural hospitals and clinics nationwide face a looming financial catastrophe, with President Trump's massive tax-and-spending law expected to slash federal Medicaid spending on health care in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years. Congressional Republicans added the one-time, five-year Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to win the support of conservative holdouts who worried about the bill's financial fallout for rural hospitals.",
      "Yet, the words used by CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz and his agency's leaders to describe the new pot of cash are generating tension between legacy hospital and clinic providers and new technology-focused companies stepping in to offer new ways to deliver health care.",
      "It's \"what I would call incumbents versus insurgents in the rural space,\" said Kody Kinsley, a senior policy adviser at the Institute for Policy Solutions at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.",
      "Applications are due Nov. 5. The money will be awarded to states by the end of the year and distributed over five years.",
      "Half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application; the other half will go to states that win points. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on a formula that calculates each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",
      "The application identifies specific policy goals such as implementing the Presidential Fitness Test and restrictions to food assistance, as well as broader investment strategies around remote care services, data infrastructure, and consumer-facing technology tools, which CMS identified as \"symptom checkers and AI chatbots.\"",
      "In September, after CMS officials released the application, Republican members of Congress from states with Democratic governors called for fairness, concerned their states might direct the money to urban areas. In a letter to Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they said the money \"will serve as a lifeline for rural and at-risk hospitals in our communities that are already struggling to keep their doors open.\"",
      "Smaller hospitals fear they will get \"a tiny little slice\" of each state's share, said Emily Felder, who leads the health care practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a law firm whose clients include rural hospital systems.",
      "\"There's a lot of frustration,\" Felder said.",
      "But Kinsley, who was previously North Carolina's secretary of health and human services, said using this money only to shore up a balance sheet \"is really just throwing good money after bad.\" In contrast, he said, insurgents such as technology-driven startups can offer new strategies.",
      "One of those companies vying for funding is Homeward Health, a Silicon Valley-based company that contracts with Medicare managed care insurers. Using artificial intelligence analytics, Homeward helps patients get care in their home and with local providers.",
      "The company manages the health of 100,000 rural Michigan patients enrolled in insurance, said Homeward co-founder and chief executive Jennifer Schneider. The company was a sponsor for the Watergate summit. It also has ongoing meetings with Oz and his team, Schneider said.",
      "\"They're doing their job, and they're talking to a lot of people in the ecosystem and really eager to learn from those of us that have been in the system,\" Schneider said. \"We're one of many in that position.\"",
      "KFF Health News requested an interview with Alina Czekai, director of the newly created Office of Rural Health Transformation. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said the agency was \"unable to accommodate facilitation of any interview.\"",
      "Instead, CMS provided an emailed statement from Oz saying the program \"will help states and communities reimagine what's possible for rural healthcare.\"",
      "Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, the largest organization representing rural hospitals and clinics, said the money would best be used to help pay for transformation that isn't \"sexy\" or \"revolutionary.\"",
      "\"If what we end up with is we have a wearable for every rural patient, I don't think that's transformational,\" Slabach said, referring to digital health monitors such as fitness-tracking watches.",
      "Slabach, a onetime small-hospital chief executive and an unofficial adviser to hundreds of rural facilities nationwide, named a few ideas for the money \u2014 including paying for capital improvements such as electronic health records or equipment, loan repayment programs to aid workforce development, and creating \"SWAT\" teams that rescue rural hospitals on the brink of closure.",
      "More than 150 rural hospitals have closed nationwide since 2010 \u2014 a statistic cited by CMS' Sutton that is well known among industry watchers. The Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, which compiles the closure data, also released a guide to help states calculate how rural they are for their applications.",
      "State applications will be reviewed by a panel, with some reviewers from within the government but others outside it, said Kate Sapra, acting deputy director of the Office of Rural Health Transformation, speaking at the Watergate.",
      "\"We will train them in the scoring criteria,\" Sapra said, adding that the panelists will not be coming from \"your state\" and will need to fill out conflict-of-interest forms. A portion of money each state gets will be reevaluated annually based on the progress it makes on its goals and priorities, according to CMS.",
      "States are creating stakeholder groups, asking for public comment, and working with their health agencies. Some, such as Mississippi and New Mexico, are hiring consultants.",
      "In Montana, a collection of health providers and associations proposed a list of ideas for the cash, including creating a loan repayment fund for rural clinicians to try to ease worker shortages.",
      "\"It's one-time money, and it's a little bit of money,\" said David Mark, a doctor who is the CEO of One Health, which has clinics dotted across eastern Montana and Wyoming. A state could receive a minimum of $100 million a year for five years if all 50 states have applications approved.",
      "\"How do you accomplish goals of a health care system transformation with an infusion of money like that?\" Mark said.",
      "Neither Montana nor Wyoming \u2014 vast, rural states \u2014 sent leaders to the Watergate summit, according to a copy of the attendees list. In the afternoon, attendees could rotate among planning tables and meet with corporate sponsors such as the electronic health records behemoth Epic and the emergency services company Global Medical Response.",
      "Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs confirmed his state did not send representatives to the event, because they were \"stretched with other commitments.\" Montana, Wyoming, and other states submitted an optional letter of intent signaling they will apply for the funds. CMS did not respond to questions about how many and which states have submitted letters.",
      "During the Watergate event, hints of brewing competition among states began to surface.",
      "\"I think Arkansas' application is going to be better than yours,\" seasoned political adviser Jack Sisson said with a smile during a morning panel.",
      "The audience laughed. Sisson, who recently left his job as health adviser for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, had interrupted Michael Hendrix, policy adviser to another Republican governor, Tennessee's Bill Lee.",
      "\"See, this is the kind of friendly competition that CMS is hoping for,\" Hendrix said. He grinned, thanked Sisson, and added, \"I look forward to us both winning.\"",
      "KFF Health News Montana correspondent Katheryn Houghton contributed to this report.",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism."

      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",

      "More people are now reaching for cannabis beverages, nonalcoholic drinks infused with tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the main ingredient in marijuana that makes you feel high. Some varieties also include cannabidiol, or CBD, a chemical compound found in marijuana or hemp that proponents say helps relieve pain, anxiety and other health symptoms. The drinks come in different forms including seltzers, juices, sodas and teas.",
      "Consumer demand for cannabis beverages is growing as Americans drink less booze. According to a July Gallup survey, the percentage of U.S. adults who say they consume alcohol fell to 54%, the lowest level since 1939, when the polling organization first started tracking people's drinking behavior. More Americans also believe even moderate alcohol consumption is unhealthy, the poll found.",
      "Hundreds of brands small and large now hawk cannabis beverages, many promising to help take the edge off in social settings.",
      "\"There's a replacement factor going on between THC beverages and wine and beer and distilled spirits,\" said Beau Whitney, chief economist at Whitney Economics, an Oregon-based consultancy focused on the cannabis and hemp industry.",
      "THC beverage sales in the U.S. are expected to grow from $1.1 billion last year to nearly $5.6 billion by 2035, according to Whitney Economics.",
      "\"The remarkable growth and innovation we're seeing in the hemp-derived beverage space is a clear sign of consumer enthusiasm and entrepreneurial success,\" Michelle Rutter Friberg, director of government relations at the National Cannabis Industry Association, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Potential health impacts, side effects",
      "Several THC beverage brands market themselves as nonalcoholic alternatives and say their drinks contain zero calories and zero sugar. Doctors, however, warn that cannabis beverages can come with side effects.",
      "Whether smoked or ingested as an edible or drink, cannabis can affect the brain, heart, lungs and mental health, CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder said, adding that the drug can trigger anxiety, paranoia, elevated heart rate and, in rare cases, psychosis.",
      "Potential short-term effects of cannabis include issues with memory, focus and coordination, said Gounder.",
      "\"People may have trouble remembering new information, paying attention or moving smoothly,\" she said. \"This can slow reaction time, cause slurred speech, and raise the risk of car crashes by 30%-40%. The effects depend on how much cannabis is used, how it's taken and how used to it someone is.\"",
      "Heavy or long-term intake of the drug, especially in teens, can lead to lasting issues with memory, attention and decision-making, said Gounder. Long-term use, she added, can also lead to cannabis-use disorder, which is a clinical term for addiction,\u00a0defined\u00a0by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as when users are unable to stop using cannabis even though it's causing them health and social problems.",
      "Some heavy users may also develop severe nausea and vomiting, Gounder said. Those most at risk are pregnant individuals, teens, and people with mental or heart conditions, she added.",
      "The potential effects of a cannabis-infused drink can be felt in as little as 15 to 20 minutes, compared with 30 to 90 minutes for an edible, according to Dr. Staci Gruber, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, in a recent article on the school's website.",
      "\"If you are interested in trying it and it is legal for you to do so, be mindful about controlling the experience until you know how a particular product affects you,\" Gruber said.",
      "Target eyes THC segment",
      "The U.S. has a patchwork of regulations governing the sale of cannabis products, with states offering varying degrees of restrictions, including minimum-age requirements. THC beverages can be legally sold in 44 states in total, \u00a037 of which allow sales outside of the marijuana dispensary systems according to Whitney.",
      "In those areas, the beverages can commonly be found at restaurants, bars, grocery stores and liquor stores.",
      "In Atlanta, for example, Scofflaw Beverage Company \u2014 previously a brewery fighting for its financial life after the pandemic \u2014 revived its business by canning drinks without alcohol that contain 5 to 10 milligrams of hemp-derived THC, CBS News Atlanta reports. Cannabis products are legal in Georgia and can be shipped across the U.S.",
      "\"It's really been an almost seismic shift in customer preference,\" Scofflaw co-founder Matt Shirah told CBS News Atlanta. \"The THC infused business has the potential to be 10 to 20 times the size of beer business.\"",
      "Cannabis beverages have even caught the attention of major retailers like Target. The Minneapolis-based chain confirmed to CBS News that it is testing the sale of THC beverages at certain Target liquor stores in Minnesota. While other retailers, such as Total Wine & More, already sell cannabis beverages, Target is the first big-box player to explore the THC beverage market.",
      "\"At Target, we're always exploring new ways to meet our guests' evolving preferences and needs,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "Whitney Economics estimates there are 500 to 750 brands marketing cannabis drinks. Of those, roughly 30 are sizable labels with national distribution, while the rest are regional and local brands, according to Diana Eberlein, chair of the Coalition for Adult Beverage Alternatives Retailers, a group that represents stakeholders in the hemp and alcohol industries.",
      "Better-known names in the space include Cycling Frog, which makes THC seltzers and edibles; Cann, which markets itself as a \"social beverage\"; and Nowadays, which employs the motto \"the future of drinking is here.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 15 Oct 2025 18:10:23 -0400",
    "summary": "A new lawsuit alleges Bank of America profited from its dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
    "story": [
      "Bank of America was sued Wednesday over its alleged financial ties with Jeffrey Epstein, with the lawsuit claiming the financial giant facilitated and also benefited from his alleged sex trafficking venture.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court on behalf of a Jane Doe, alleges Epstein committed his crimes \"through access to funding and financial support from both individuals and institutions, including Bank of America.\" Epstein died in 2019 in jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "\"Egregiously, Bank of America had a plethora of information regarding Epstein's sex trafficking operation but chose profit over protecting the victims,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Bank of America said it has no immediate comment on the lawsuit.",
      "The lawsuit comes after Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland and the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, opened an investigation into four large banks, including Bank of America, over their business relationship with Epstein. The probe is seeking more information about roughly $1.5 billion in financial transactions handled by the banks on behalf of Epstein.",
      "Suspicious activity?",
      "Jane Doe was living in Russia when she met Epstein in 2011, and was sexually abused and trafficked by him until 2019, the lawsuit alleges. It claims Epstein relied on force, threats, fraud and coercion to control her.",
      "In 2013, Epstein's accountant instructed her to open a Bank of America account, where money could be wired, purportedly to generate records for U.S. immigration authorities and to cover her rent, according to the lawsuit. The banking transactions should have raised red flags with the bank, the complaint alleges.",
      "\"A review of Jane Doe's account history will show incredibly alarming and erratic banking behavior, as Epstein, through one of his loyal employees, would utilize Jane Doe's account, often without her knowledge, to conduct business in amounts that were not typical for Jane Doe, and that would have in fact been impossible based on Jane Doe's income or typical pattern of deposit,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Banks are required by law to report suspicious activity in customer accounts to federal authorities in order to flag potential criminal activity, such as money laundering or fraud. The complaint alleges that Bank of America failed to file suspicious activity reports, known as SARs, until after Epstein's death in 2019.",
      "According to the New York Times, Bank of America\u00a0filed two SARs in 2020 related to $170 million in payments made to Epstein by billionaire investor Leon Black. The timing of the SARs was questioned by Raskin in an October 2025 letter to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan.",
      "\"These SARs not only were untimely \u2014 filed years after the transactions in question \u2014 but Bank of America processed the payments without asking for information as to the nature of the transactions,\" Raskin wrote. \"Financial institutions are often the first line of defense in detecting serious federal crimes, especially the ones that involve significant flows of money like sex trafficking.\"",
      "He added, \"Flagging and detecting Mr. Epstein's suspicious withdrawals may well have stopped his crimes years earlier.\"",
      "The Oct. 15 lawsuit claims that \"Bank of America's failure to timely file SARs about Epstein's sex-trafficking venture, in spite of numerous red flags, was wrongful and purposeful.\"",
      "The complaint also alleges that Epstein would not have been able to expand his illegal operations \"without complicit financial banking institutions that would ignore red flags and assist him in his sex-trafficking scheme.\"",
      "JPMorgan's settlement",
      "In exchange for looking the other way, the suit alleges, Bank of America profited by earning \"interest, commissions, service fees, and other financial benefits directly from its connection with Epstein, Epstein-related entities, and others acting in concert with Epstein.\"",
      "In 2023, JPMorgan Chase reached a\u00a0$290 million settlement with Epstein's victims over allegations the bank overlooked his crimes because of the profits it earned from him. At the time of the settlement, JPMorgan said it regretted its association with Epstein and that it \"would never have continued to do business with him if we believed he was using our bank in any way to help commit heinous crimes.\"",
      "The lawsuit against Bank of America is seeking class-action status on behalf of other women abused by Epstein. The attorney representing Jane Doe is David Boies of law firm Boies Schiller Flexner, who represented Epstein's victims in the settlement with JPMorgan."

      "\"The entire fourth quarter, the fall break, Thanksgiving, Christmas, they're all likely to set records with strong demand,\" Kirby told CBS News last month. \"At the beginning of July, it was like a light switch got flipped on and demand started to come back.\"",

    "story": [
      "America's population of seniors is expected to surge by 40% over the next 25 years \u2014 a shift that could spark a crisis of aging, as most people remain unprepared for longer lives, according to new research from the MIT AgeLab and insurance company John Hancock.",
      "Americans are lagging in readiness to handle the demands of greater longevity, ranging from managing the cost of a longer retirement to maintaining their health in old age, according to the inaugural Longevity Preparedness Index, or LPI, from the MIT AgeLab, a research institute focusing on improving the quality of life for older people, and John Hancock.",
      "The problem goes well beyond saving for retirement \u2014 another area where Americans are known to fall short \u2014 and touches nearly every aspect of aging, from building community in later life to preparing for care when people can no longer look after themselves. Some people may fail to plan simply because they underestimate their own longevity, with\u00a0earlier research by Stanford University retirement expert Annamaria Lusardi finding that Americans generally believe they'll die younger than statistics predict.",
      "\"Believe it or not, longevity is quite new \u2014 we've always had older people, but never this many older people living this long,\" Joe Coughlin, founder and director of the MIT AgeLab, told CBS News. \"We can't look to our parents, saying 'This is how they did it.'\"",
      "Preparing for a long old age isn't all about money, although that remains an important part of retirement readiness, said Brooks Tingle, CEO of John Hancock, told CBS. While Americans are living longer, they're spending more years in poorer health, which raises additional issues around preparing for longer retirements than prior generations, he noted.",
      "A 65-year-old woman has a 40% chance of living to age 90, while men the same age have a 30% chance of reaching that age, according to Lusardi's research.",
      "The study analyzed eight aspects of longevity preparedness:",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.\u00a0Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.\u00a0Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.\u00a0Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.\u00a0Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.\u00a0Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "Social connection: Relationships with family, friends and community.",
      "Finance: Having enough saved for retirement and old age.",
      "Daily activities: Keeping busy with meaningful daily activities.",
      "Care: Identifying who will care for you if you need assistance, understanding the costs of care and having advance directives in place.",
      "Home: Modifying your home to prolong independence in old age.",
      "Community: Access to health care, stores, recreation and transportation.",
      "Health: Developing positive physical, mental, and cognitive behavioral habits to maintain health as you age.",
      "Life transitions: Preparing for major changes like retirement, the death of a loved one and more.",
      "U.S. adults scored an average of 60 out of 100 across the eight areas, which MIT and John Hancock said signifies that Americans' general longevity preparedness is low.",
      "\"Preparedness is, yes, about saving money, but really it's practically being aware of other things you'll have to do, like 'What should I do, who am I going to live with,'\" Coughlin said. \"Your Zip code is probably your bigger predictor of quality of life, not your 401(k).\"",
      "Care emerged as Americans' weakest area of preparedness, with an average score of 42 out of 100 on the LPI. The strongest domain was community, where people scored 70, suggesting greater readiness for maintaining access to stores, health care and recreation as they age.",
      "The price of long-term care, such as assisted living facilities, can easily cost $6,000 per month or more, placing it out of reach for many Americans. But smaller, less costly steps can also make a difference, such as identifying friends or family members who could step in to help if you ever need extra support, Tingle noted.",
      "\"It's not just, 'Will I need intensive care?' but 'Who is going to change the lightbulb for me when I'm 91?,'\" Tingle said. \"A big takeaway is just to start these conversations.\"",
      "He added, \"Most families don't ever talk about these things.\"",
      "To be sure, saving for retirement can ease many of these issues, ranging from having the resources to pay for long-term care to modifying your home with grab bars and other additions that can prolong independent living. On average, Americans scored a 64 for financial preparedness, but the study found a large gap between those with few assets and people with wealth.",
      "Those with less than $50,000 in investible assets had an overall longevity preparedness score of 56, while those with more than $3 million in assets scored 65, the survey found. People with financial advisers scored a 65, while those without ranked 7 points lower, it noted.",
      "\"Those who had financial advisers had better scores \u2014 of course they did better. The better financial advisers don't just advise you on your wealth, they help you anticipate what will come tomorrow,\" Coughlin noted. \"You have someone who is asking you to think about what those future plans are.\"",
      "He added, \"Most of us are hacking longevity, and we figure it out day after day.\" But he said he hopes the LPI will \"change the cultural narrative\" about aging by shifting the conversation beyond money to include how people can plan how to live and find purpose in their later years."

      "Allegations of human trafficking",
      "Federal prosecutors said Prince Group targeted victims around the world with assistance from local networks, including one operated from Brooklyn, New York. To carry out the schemes, the criminal actors allegedly trafficked hundreds of people and forced them to work in a network of compounds across Cambodia. The \"violent, forced labor camps\" consisted of vast dormitories surrounded by high walls and barbed wire, according to the Justice Department.",
      "To dodge law enforcement, Chen and Prince Group's top executives allegedly paid bribes to public officials and used their political influence, the department said.",

      "The Trump administration's new tariffs on imported furniture, kitchen cabinets and other housewares, along with lumber, took effect Tuesday, added costs that economists say could push up prices for consumers.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the trade measures on Sept. 29, saying the levies are intended to prevent such products manufactured abroad from \"flooding\" the U.S.",

Recent inflation data showed that prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025, driven by country-based U.S. tariffs, according to economists.",
      "Furniture and bedding prices rose 4.7% over the same period, while the cost of household furnishings and supplies climbed 2.8%."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jerome-powell-speech-today-federal-reserve-labor-market-rate-cuts/",
    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 16:24:30 -0400",
    "summary": "Jerome Powell said the labor market's outlook hasn't changed much since the central bank's September meeting, when it penciled in two more rate cuts this year.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday emphasized that a sharp slowdown in hiring poses a growing risk to the U.S. economy, a sign that the central bank will likely cut its key interest rate twice more this year.",
      "Powell, who spoke today before the National Association of Business Economics in Philadelphia, said that despite the federal government shutdown cutting off official economic data, \"the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting,\" when the Fed reduced its key rate for the first time this year.",
      "Fed officials at the September meeting also forecast that the central bank would reduce its rate twice more this year and once in 2026. Lower rates from the Fed could\u00a0reduce borrowing costs for consumer and business loans, making it cheaper for businesses to expand operations and hire new workers, and for Americans to buy houses, autos and other items.",
      "\"Holding rates higher presents risks to the job market. Job creation is below trend given the pace of economic growth,\" noted Scott Helfstein, head of investment strategy at investment firm Global X, in an emailed response to Powell's comments. \"The Fed is still likely to cut rates in October and December, but investors should be prepared for a range of outcomes as Powell is trying to leave all options open.\"",
      "The Fed's next rate decision will be made at its Oct. 29 meeting. Following that, the central bank has one more rate decision meeting scheduled in 2025, set for Dec. 10.",
      "Powell reiterated a message he first delivered after the September meeting, when he signaled that the Fed is slightly more worried about the job market than its other congressional mandate, which is to keep prices stable. Tariffs have lifted the Fed's preferred measure of inflation to 2.9%, he said, but outside the duties there aren't \"broader inflationary pressures\" that will keep prices high.",
      "\"Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks,\" he said.",
      "Powell also said that the central bank may soon stop shrinking its roughly $6.6 trillion balance sheet. The Fed has been allowing roughly $40 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities to mature each month without replacing them. The shift could weigh on longer-term Treasury interest rates.",
      "Separately, Powell spent most of his speech defending the Fed's practice of buying longer-term Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in 2020 and 2021, which were intended to lower longer-term interest rates and support the economy during the pandemic.",
      "Yet those purchases have come under a torrent of criticism from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, as well as some of the\u00a0candidates\u00a0floated by the Trump administration to replace Powell when his term as Chair ends next May.",
      "Bessent said in an extended critique\u00a0published earlier this year\u00a0that the huge purchases of bonds during the pandemic worsened inequality by boosting the stock market, without providing noticeable benefits to the economy.",
      "Other critics have long argued that the Fed kept implementing the purchases for too long, keeping interest rates low even as inflation began to spike in late 2021. The Fed beginning in 2021 stopped the purchases and then sharply boosted borrowing costs to combat inflation.",
      "\"With the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\" Powell said. \"Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risk.\"",
      "Powell also said the purchases were intended to avoid a breakdown in the market for Treasury securities, which could have sent interest rates much higher."

    "published": "Tue, 14 Oct 2025 15:59:56 -0400",
    "summary": "Citing the shutdown, the Social Security Administration postponed its announcement of the annual payment bump beneficiaries will receive in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The Social Security Administration's annual announcement setting next year's cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will be delayed because of the\u00a0government shutdown, the agency said.",
      "Each year, the Social Security Administration adjusts benefits for its 75 million recipients based on recent inflation data, which ensures that seniors, disabled Americans and other beneficiaries don't lose purchasing power as prices rise.",
      "Social Security had planned to announce the new COLA on Oct. 15, the same day the Labor Department was scheduled to release September Consumer Price Index data, a key measure of inflation. The COLA is determined by inflation figures for the third quarter, which covers July through September.",
      "With much of the government's economic data on hold until Congress approves federal funding, the Bureau of Labor Statistics now plans to release its latest CPI figures on Oct. 24, about nine days later than planned. The Social Security Administration told CBS News it plans to issue its COLA announcement that same day.",
      "\"The Bureau of Labor Statistics has announced they will issue the September 2025 Consumer Price Index on October 24,\" the Social Security Administration said in an Oct. 14 email. \"The Social Security Administration will use this release to generate and announce the 2026 cost-of-living adjustment on October 24 as well.\"",
      "The new COLA will take effect starting Jan. 1, 2026, without any delays due to the ongoing shutdown, the agency added.",
      "How much of a living adjustment?",
      "According to an estimate published last month by the Senior Citizens League, the annual COLA for 2026 could be around 2.7%, slightly higher than the 2.5% increase beneficiaries\u00a0received\u00a0in 2025.",
      "The League, an advocacy group for older Americans, based its most recent projection on\u00a0August inflation data\u00a0from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because the SSA will also include September inflation data in its COLA rate, that number could change when it's announced later this month.",
      "AARP, another advocacy group for older people, expects the 2026 COLA to range from 2.6% to 2.9%. A 2.7% boost in benefits would lift the average monthly payment for retired workers by $54, from $2,008 to $2,062.",
      "Where is inflation now?",
      "The September CPI is forecast to rise to an annual rate of 3.1% up from 2.9% in August, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "According to economists, inflation is edging higher due partly to the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, which have hit imports from across the globe, such as clothing, food, steel and toys. While some businesses stockpiled imported goods earlier this year to avoid raising rising prices, some are now passing the import taxes\u00a0on to their customers.",
      "\"Core goods pressures have started to heat up, marking the beginning of a delayed tariff passthrough,\" RBC economists Michael Reid and Carrie Freestone said in an Oct. 14 report. \"Concerningly, the breadth of inflationary pressures has widened \u2014 45% of CPI basket items are now reporting price growth at or above 3%, compared to roughly two-thirds pre-pandemic.\"",
      "Some retirees could face a financial pinch if prices continues to climb and their 2026 Social Security adjustment fails to keep pace with inflation. The Federal Reserve\u00a0forecasts\u00a0that the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, its favored measure of inflation, will rise to 3.1% this year before receding to 2.6% in 2026."

      "The J.M. Smucker Company, the brand that makes peanut butter and jelly spreads, is suing Trader Joe's over what it says is a copycat version of its Uncrustables sandwiches.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Ohio on Monday, accuses the popular grocery chain of trademark infringement for selling pre-made peanut butter and jelly\u00a0sandwiches\u00a0that closely mimic the company's Uncrustables' packaging and crustless sandwich design.",
      "Smucker's calls the Trader Joe's product an \"obvious attempt to trade off of the fame and recognition of the Uncrustables Design Marks.\" The lawsuit also alleges that the supposed copycat version of the product has \"deceived\" consumers into thinking the Trader Joe's product is in some way sponsored by or affiliated with Smucker's.",
      "\"Our focus is solely on protecting the unique trademarked design that represents the high quality associated with the Uncrustables brand and preventing consumer confusion caused by imitation,\" Smucker's said in a statement to CBS news.",
      "Trader Joe's did not respond to request for comment.",
      "A crustless copycat?",
      "Smuckers' Uncrustables, designed for lunchbox convenience, is a round pocket of white bread with crimped edges. Inside are different fillings such as chocolate-flavored hazelnut spread and strawberry jam or grape jelly with peanut butter. The company has marketed the sandwiches as quick-and-easy kids' lunch options for parents on the go, requiring no prep, just time to thaw outside of the freezer before consumption.",
      "In its court filing, Smucker's said it's been using the round pie-like shape to represent the product since 1996 and an image of the sandwich with a bite taken out of it since 2000. Uncrustables are sold in thousands of retail stores across the country and are on track to becoming a $1 billion brand, according to the complaint.",
      "The Trader Joe's product accused of being an Uncrustables knockoff is described on packaging as \"crustless peanut butter & strawberry jam sandwiches.\" The round pocket-sized sandwiches come in a bright blue box with a stack of the sandwiches depicted on the front, with a small bite taken out of the top sandwich, revealing the filling.",
      "Smucker's alleges that Trader Joe's packaging closely mimics that of the Uncrustables, by prominently featuring the same color blue Smucker's uses in its own branding. On Smucker's packaging, the word \"Uncrustables\" appears in a blue font, the lawsuit notes.",
      "Smucker's alleges Trader Joe's decision to use a similar design will deceive and cause confusion among customers. It will also claims that \"irreparable injury\" will be caused to the Smucker's brand unless the court takes action to limit Trader Joe's \"wrongful acts\" according to the lawsuit.",
      "Smucker's has requested in its complaint that Trader Joe's stop using branding its says imitates that of the \"Uncrustables Design Marks.\" It calls on Trader Joe's to deliver the affected products \u2014 including containers, labels, packaging and more \u2014 for destruction. It also asks the grocery chain to pay Smucker's \"gains, profits, and advantages Defendant has obtained\" as a result of the alleged trademark infringement, as well as legal fees."

    "summary": "Many IRS workers are furloughed due to the government shutdown, but taxpayers are still required to file their extensions this week.",
    "story": [
      "Although the U.S. government remains closed, taxpayers who requested a filing extension from the IRS earlier this year remain on the hook to submit their income tax returns by Oct. 15.",
      "\"Taxpayers should continue to file, deposit and pay federal income taxes as they normally would,\" an IRS spokesman told CBS News. \"The lapse in appropriations does not change federal income tax responsibilities.\"",
      "In a typical year, about 20 million Americans \u2014 about 13% of all taxpayers \u2014 ask the IRS for a tax filing extension, according to agency data. Extensions, which are provided automatically if a taxpayer requests more time, provide an additional six months to prepare and file federal returns.",
      "An extension can help taxpayers who are facing complex tax situations or who need extra time to get their documents prepared for filing. Even so, an extension doesn't get exempt you from paying taxes you owe to the IRS, as the tax agency expects taxpayers to make good on their debts by the regular April 15 deadline.",
      "Most IRS operations are closed during the government shutdown. About half of the agency's workers have been on furlough since Oct. 8, with essential employees continuing to work in areas such as taxpayer services and submission processing, according to Baker Tilly, a tax advisory company.",
      "When is the tax extension deadline?",
      "The deadline to file your taxes if you've received an extension is 11:59 p.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 15, in your local time zone, which means taxpayers should submit their electronic filing before that time on Wednesday.",
      "Can you get an extension past Oct. 15?",
      "Generally, no, according to the IRS.",
      "However, the agency this year has given some state residents more time beyond Oct. 15 to file their federal returns due to natural disasters in their regions.",
      "For instance, all residents of both\u00a0Arkansas\u00a0and\u00a0Tennessee\u00a0qualify for an extension because of April storms, flooding and tornadoes. Taxpayers in those states have until Nov. 3 to file their federal returns. Kentucky residents and people living in some West Virginia counties also have until Nov. 3 due to February storms that caused severe damage in those areas.",
      "What are the penalties for missing the filing deadline?",
      "If you miss the Oct. 15 filing date to file your tax return, the IRS will charge 5% of the amount due for each month or part of the month that it is late, up to a maximum of 25%.",
      "But the IRS says\u00a0that it might waive the penalty \"if you have a reasonable explanation for filing late,\" and asks taxpayers to attach an explanation for the late filing with their tax return.",

    "published": "Sun, 12 Oct 2025 20:29:00 -0400",
    "summary": "DealBook founder and Squawk Box co-host Andrew Ross Sorkin takes a look at the crash of 1929 in his new book. He tells 60 Minutes what may it may indicate about today's stock market.",
    "story": [
      "After nearly a decade spent studying the most famous stock market crash in history, financial journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin warns that the Wall Street of today echoes the market of 1929, when highs preceded a massive slump, leading to the Great Depression.",
      "Artificial intelligence and technology have contributed to a remarkable boom in recent years. But, Sorkin said, today's economy is being propped up by the AI boom, and it's too soon to tell if this is a sugar rush, a short-term and unsustainable boost to the markets. But, Sorkin is positive there's a crash coming.",
      "\"I just can't tell you when, and I can't tell you how deep,\" he said. \"But I can assure you, unfortunately, I wish I wasn't saying this, we will have a crash.\"",
      "The Roaring '20s",
      "Despite a tumble this Friday, stocks on Wall Street have shot up in recent months. Still, some investors are getting weak in the knees, fearing stocks are overheated. Sorkin, author of \"1929: Inside the Greatest Crash in Wall Street History \u2013 and How It Shattered a Nation,\" out Oct. 14, says the U.S. is in a new roaring 20s, the 2020s, with stocks pushing to record highs, just as they were in the 1920s.",
      "Market highs today have him feeling anxious.",
      "\"I'm anxious that we are at prices that may not feel sustainable. And what I don't know is we are either living through some kind of remarkable boom and part of that's artificial intelligence and technology, and all of that, or everything's overpriced,\" he said.",
      "The market of 1929 was fueled by rampant speculation, including by ordinary investors unaware of the mounting risks, and of heavy borrowing. People of modest means were lured by Wall Street bankers and other stock market touts to invest using what was then a newfangled concept: credit. It was called buying on a margin. You only had to put down 10% of the stock price, borrowing the rest from your banker.",
      "Before 1919, most people did not take on credit or debt, influenced by religious views and moral norms against borrowing money, Sorkin said. That changed when General Motors, in 1919, started lending people money so they could afford to buy the company's cars. It changed out Americans shopped.",
      "\"And then the bankers realize what's happening, and they realize that they can lend out money so that more folks can buy stocks. It was all sort of wrapped in the flag of democratizing access,\" Sorkin said. \"And in good times, when the stock is going up, it's like free money. In bad times, you're on the hook, and you're on the hook in a very bad way.\"",
      "Today, it's hundreds of billions being invested in AI, with some investment pros warning of a possible bubble as stocks soar to stratospheric heights even amid significant economic uncertainty, such as Friday's slide after President Trump\u00a0 threatened more China tariffs.",
      "\"I think it's hard to say we're not in a bubble of some sort,\" Sorkin said. \"The question is always when is the bubble going to pop?\"",
      "Protecting consumers in the market",
      "When things got out of control in 1929, frightened traders dumped stocks as investors lost their businesses and homes. In the years since, laws, regulations and agencies have been put in place to protect investors.",
      "Some of those barriers to prevent exploitation are now coming down, Sorkin said. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules have become less stringent and \"the Consumer Protection Bureau practically doesn't exist anymore.\"",
      "\"That's what concerns me,\" Sorkin said. \"It's not that we're going off a cliff tomorrow. It's that there's speculation in the market today, there's an increasing amount of debt in the market today, and all of that's happening against the backdrop of the guardrails coming off.\"",
      "Those guardrails include ones that allow only the wealthy to invest directly in private companies that have fewer regulations, like AI startups before they go public.",
      "In recent decades, people who could invest in private equity and venture capital outperformed investors who did not. Those kinds of assets, generally restricted to wealthy investors, are potentially more rewarding, but also riskier.",
      "\"Public companies, after the SEC was created, were required to have all sorts of disclosure rules so that the public could understand what's going on inside them. Private companies don't have that,\" Sorkin said. \"But historically, the average ordinary American wasn't really allowed to invest in the private companies. But in this flag of democratizing finance, there's a lot of people who want access to that.\"",
      "Some people feel elite investors have better access, while others are unable to get in early on opportunities, Sorkin said. There's been a push by both the Trump administration and the financial sector to open up the market to more people.",
      "But that would also require moving the guardrails designed to protect people.",
      "\"They have protected a lot of people, but some people would say they protected people from getting rich,\" Sorkin said.",
      "Push today for democratizing investing",
      "In his latest annual letter to investors, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink suggested opening retirement 401(k)s to riskier private investments in the name of democratizing investing. He said there were opportunities for investing in AI or data centers.",
      "Right now money managers are precluded from investing in those types of assets in many retirement products, but the Trump administration is in the process of changing that, Fink explained.",
      "The new investment opportunity comes with risk.",
      "\"But everything is risky other than keeping your money in a bank account overnight,\" Fink said.",
      "Fink, who once called bitcoin the domain of money launderers and thieves, also wants to add crypto to investment portfolios.",
      "\"The markets teach you, you have to always relook at your assumptions,\" he said. \"There is a role for crypto in the same way there is a role for gold \u2014 that is, it's an alternative.\"",
      "He sees it, as he does AI, as an opportunity to add diversity to a portfolio.",
      "But Sorkin says some crypto products, like meme coins, can be abused in ways similar to 1929, with speculators sending the value of cryptocurrencies soaring before they come crashing down. Sorkin has his own personal example involving a television appearance with Fink.",
      "\"He makes a joke, I think, about how there should be a Sorkin coin. Well, two hours later, somebody makes a Sorkin coin. And all of a sudden, this Sorkin coin is now worth millions of dollars. And I'm watching it,\" Sorkin said.",
      "The Sorkin coin peaked at $170 million worth of trading in a day.",
      "\"And I think today it does something like $20 or $21 a day,\" Sorkin said."

In sum, about 10,000 U.S. forces are built up in the Caribbean region, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, CBS News learned Wednesday.",
      "The military has also carried out airstrikes on at least five alleged drug-carrying boats near Venezuela since last month. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he has authorized covert CIA operations in the South American country, and said his administration is considering strikes on drug traffickers by land.",
      "Tensions have spiked between the U.S. and Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of collaborating with cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua.

    "summary": "Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is introducing a resolution in the House calling for stricter standards of conduct for federal immigration agents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is introducing a resolution in the House calling for stricter standards of conduct for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, citing what he describes as \"lawless\" enforcement tactics during recent federal crackdowns.",
      "The resolution, cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Jonathan Jackson and Jasmine Crockett, urges the Department of Homeland Security to require ICE and CBP personnel to wear body cameras, display visible identification and stop wearing facial coverings except in cases of immediate safety threats. It also calls for transferring oversight of ICE to the Justice Department and creating independent civilian review boards to investigate enforcement actions.",
      "\"This is about respecting law enforcement as professionals, but having high professional standards,\" Khanna told CBS News. \"We should hold ICE officers to the same level of transparency and accountability we expect of police officers or FBI agents.\"",
      "The resolution, set to be introduced Friday, is unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled lower chamber, where Republicans have strongly backed the Trump administration's immigrant enforcement operations and resisted new restrictions on federal agents. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer included roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion for ICE.",
      "Khanna's proposal follows weeks of heightened tension over Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration initiative that has led to more than 1,500 arrests across Illinois and neighboring states. Immigration operations have drawn scrutiny after reports of masked agents, unmarked vehicles and violent encounters involving civilians and journalists.",
      "On Tuesday, federal agents deployed tear gas during an attempted arrest on Chicago's Southeast Side, prompting clashes with residents and local police. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered immigration officers operating in the area to wear body cameras, saying she was \"a little startled\" after seeing reports of tear gas and force used against protesters. \"I live in Chicago,\" Ellis said. \"And I'm not blind.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson defended federal immigration officers earlier this week, saying he has \"not seen them cross the line yet.\" Johnson told reporters that \"ICE and the valiant, brave, patriotic Americans who step up to serve in these dangerous law enforcement positions deserve our respect and our support,\" adding that Republicans \"stand for law enforcement.\"",
      "Khanna's resolution references recent incidents in Chicago and similar tactics in Los Angeles and New York, warning that the use of masks and unmarked vehicles \"fuels impersonation of immigration officers\" and undermines public trust. He said he hopes to build a coalition that includes libertarian-leaning Republicans and members of the Freedom Caucus who \"understand the importance of not having government overreach.\"",
      "On Thursday, DHS defended its officers, saying federal agents have faced escalating assaults. \"CBP Officers and Agents are facing a barrage of assaults including incidents involving thrown rocks, bricks, and other dangerous objects that can cause serious injury to law enforcement personnel or members of the public,\" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. She added that officers \"are authorized to defend themselves and others\" and that DHS \"reviews all uses of force thoroughly and takes its legal and operational responsibilities seriously.\"",
      "The department has said assaults against ICE agents have risen more than 1,000% this year, though it has not released data supporting that figure.",
      "Khanna said his resolution aims to restore public confidence while ensuring officer safety.",
      "\"I unequivocally condemn the threats and violence against ICE agents,\" he said. \"They are law enforcement officials doing a job, and there should be no intimidation or threats. This will make sure that Americans' constitutional rights are protected and the constitutional rights of immigrants are protected.\""

Mr. Trump said intelligence confirmed that the boat was trafficking narcotics and referred to the men aboard as \"narcoterrorists,\" but offered no other information.",
      "This was the fifth such strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean. Figures released by the administration say 27 people have been killed in the strikes.",
      "The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service said it was \"aware of the reports\" that citizens of the country, which lies less than 10 miles off the coast Venezuela, had been on the vessel. Police said they are conducting inquiries, but said that the information \"is yet to be fully verified through official channels\" and said they could not confirm any details. The agency said a statement would be released once information was verified, and asked for \"patience and understanding\" amid \"this complex situation.\"",
      "Police said in a phone interview with Agence France-Presse   that residents of the village of Las Cuevas reported two Trinidadians were believed to be on the sunken vessel.",
      "Lawmakers from both parties have been expressing growing concern about the strikes and frustration with the lack of information from the White House as to their intent. Some Republicans are seeking more details from the White House on the legal justification for the actions, while Democrats contend they violate U.S. and international law. A war powers resolution\u00a0that would have barred\u00a0the Trump administration from conducting the strikes without Congressional authorization failed to pass the Senate last week.",
      "The strikes come amid rising tensions with Venezuela. Mr. Trump told CBS News' Ed O'Keefe on Wednesday that he had authorized the CIA to\u00a0conduct covert operations\u00a0in the country. The president also said his administration is looking into\u00a0potential land strikes\u00a0against Venezuela. There has been a major build-up of U.S. forces the region in recent weeks. The U.S. Justice Department in August doubled a bounty for information leading to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's capture to\u00a0$50 million.",
      "Maduro\u00a0has accused Washington of plotting regime change,\u00a0CBS News previously reported, and has called recent U.S.' actions \"aggression\", following up by ordering new military exercises on Wednesday. \u00a0He is widely accused of winning re-election last year through fraud and Mr. Trump alleges that he is the head of a drug cartel, which the Venezuelan leader denies."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0Senate Democrats blocked an effort to advance an individual year-long appropriations bill to fund the Pentagon on Thursday, stalling Republican leaders' alternative approach to restart some funding on Day 16 of the\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "In a 50 to 44 vote, all but three Democrats voted against moving forward with the full-year Defense Department appropriations bill. Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania voted in favor of advancing the bill. It needed 60 votes to advance.",
      "The vote came as the Senate remained locked in a stalemate, with no movement despite repeated votes on a short-term funding measure to reopen the government. The push to move forward with the Pentagon funding bill marked a change in approach as the shutdown wore on.",
      "Since 60 votes are required to advance most legislation in the Senate, Republicans need support from across the aisle to reopen the government. And with 53 Republicans in the Senate, Democratic support was also needed to advance the full-year Pentagon funding bill. Democrats have continued to demand an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits in exchange for their support.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune railed against Democrats on the Senate floor after the vote fell short, saying\u2028Democrats \"just voted against the bill that would actually pay the troops.\"",
      "\"This is politics,\" Thune said. \"If anything was needed to demonstrate just how fundamentally uninterested Democrats are in supporting our troops and defending our country, just take a look at this vote.\"",
      "The South Dakota Republican said \"the Democrat Party is the party that will not take yes for an answer,\" citing the repeated failed vote on a temporary measure to fund the government, his assertions that he would guarantee a vote on Democrats' health care demands and the failed effort to advance the Pentagon funding bill.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated ahead of the vote Thursday that Democrats would oppose advancing the legislation. The New York Democrat told reporters at a news conference that \"it's always been unacceptable to Democrats to do the Defense bill without other bills that have so many things that are important to the American people, in terms of health care, in terms of housing, in terms of safety.\"",
      "Although Democrats have been at odds with Republicans over how to keep the government funded in the short term, they have generally been supportive of work on the regular appropriations process. But Schumer argued that \"we have always negotiated these appropriations agreements in a bipartisan way,\" and Republicans are now \"just going at it alone.\"",
      "Each year, Congress must pass legislation to fund the government. But the process has often stretched late into the fiscal year, forcing lawmakers to pass stopgap measures to keep the government funded while they continue work on the 12 full-year appropriations bills. In recent years, Congress has resorted to grouping the funding measures together into large packages, known as omnibus bills. Those are often considered at the last minute before a deadline, pressuring lawmakers to support them and fund the government. Still, GOP leadership in Congress has been pushing to return to the way the appropriations process is intended to play out, with individual funding bills.",
      "Thune encouraged Democrats earlier Thursday to allow the full-year Pentagon funding bill to advance, telling reporters that if Democrats \"want to stop the Defense bill, I don't think it's very good optics for them.\"",
      "\"They've got multiple opportunities to block it on the back end,\" Thune said. \"If I were them, I'd let us get on it, and then let's see if we can add.\"",
      "Thune said lawmakers wanted to add appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, noting that a couple of other appropriations bills are available to wrap into a funding package as well. But doing so would require unanimous consent after a vote on advancing the measure. Schumer said \"they don't have it\" ahead of the vote.",
      "The Pentagon legislation would restore paychecks for members of the military. It comes as President Trump directed the department to \"use all available funds\" to avoid service members missing their mid-month paychecks on Oct. 15. Still, the move hasn't taken pressure off of lawmakers to reach a permanent solution, with Speaker Mike Johnson calling the administration's maneuver a \"temporary fix.\""

      "Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency in charge of the legal immigration system, said the vetting effort primarily relies on what he called the \"social media screening\" of people applying for green cards and other immigration applications.",
      "In August, the Trump administration issued a directive instructing USCIS officials to consider the identification of \"anti-American\" views and activity of certain applicants for immigration benefits as an \"overwhelmingly negative factor\" that could justify denial.",
      "Asked what types of views and activities could be found to be \"anti-American\" by his agency, Edlow cited \"what we've seen college campuses to have allowed over the last several years.\"",
      "\"There has been such a large-scale espousing of foreign terrorist ideology, whether it's Hamas or another organization that has been matched with \u2026 a clear desire by these elements to trample on the rights of other people around them,\" Edlow told CBS News during an interview at USCIS headquarters in Maryland.",
      "Pressed on whether those determinations could be based on speech protected by the U.S. Constitution, Edlow said, \"Absolutely not.\"",
      "\"People are free to make whatever statements they want on social media or anywhere else. And anyone who, you know, doesn't support the same candidate that I support. That is not what we're talking about,\" he said.",
      "\"We are talking about beyond the pale,\" Edlow added. \"We are talking about people who are actively supporting the violent overthrow of this country, or otherwise are providing material support to terrorist organizations across the world.\"",
      "Edlow said the probe into \"anti-American\" views and activities would not be the sole criteria for granting or denying applications.",
      "\"It's not the deciding factor. It's not the only factor, but it is one factor that we want to make sure that we fully understand,\" he said.",
      "Critics of the Trump administration have accused it of weaponizing U.S. immigration law to punish noncitizens for their legally protected speech.",
      "Federal courts have questioned the legality of the administration's effort to deport legal residents like Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who participated in protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza. The administration has claimed Khalil and other activists undermined U.S. foreign policy and fostered antisemitism. But those targeted and their allies have argued the government is simply penalizing them for exercising their First Amendment rights.",

      "But under the second Trump administration, USCIS has placed a greater emphasis on combating immigration fraud, aggressively vetting applicants and working more closely with ICE, including to facilitate arrests at its offices across the country. This summer, the agency also announced it would hire and train its own team of armed special agents, who Edlow said are not yet on the job.",
      "The citizenship process alone has been tweaked several times by the Trump administration, which has added more questions to the civics test used to quiz applicants on U.S. history and politics, and expanded inquiries into whether applicants have \"good moral character.\"",
      "It has also restarted a long-dormant practice, known as \"neighborhood checks,\" which involves sending investigators to interview the neighbors and coworkers of citizenship applicants. Edlow said those checks will not apply to every case due to resource constraints.",
      "Immigrant advocates argue the changes are unfairly scaring legal immigrants. But Edlow said USCIS is \"moving back to where it was supposed to be at the beginning,\" arguing that it had effectively become \"a rubber-stamping agency\" under the Biden administration. He said vetting has always been a core function of USCIS since its creation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",
      "\"We are not here as a police force,\" he said. \"We are going to be here with our agents investigating large scale fraud patterns that right now create much confusion and many problems within the legal immigration system.\"",
      "Edlow argued the effort would ultimately make it easier for people to immigrate to the U.S. legally.",
      "\"I don't want to be the DMV \u2026 of this government,\" Edlow added. \"We want to be faster. We want to be leaner.\"",
      "No decision yet on DACA's future",
      "One of the most well-known programs administered by USCIS is the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which currently protects half a million so-called \"Dreamers\" from deportation and allows them to work in the U.S. legally. They are immigrants who, as children, entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas.",
      "The first Trump administration tried to terminate DACA, arguing it was illegal. But the Supreme Court blocked the effort on technical grounds.",
      "Asked whether the second Trump administration will try to end DACA again, Edlow suggested a final decision had not been made.",
      "\"We're still engaged in conversation. Obviously there's a lot of litigation on that,\" he added. \"As that continues to play out \u2026 we'll see where we land.\"",
      "Asked why the administration had not articulated a policy position on DACA this time around, Edlow said the question should be posed to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security, USCIS' parent agency.",
      "In recent years, federal courts in Texas and Louisiana have declared DACA \u2014 and the Biden administration's efforts to codify the policy \u2014 illegal. But they have allowed current recipients to continue renewing their two-year work permits and deportation deferrals.",
      "The Republican-led states challenging DACA's legality, however, recently asked a federal judge in Texas to order the Trump administration to gradually terminate the policy. It's unclear when or how the judge will rule.",
      "In 2020, Edlow, then USCIS' deputy director, agreed with the GOP-led states' argument against DACA, calling it a \"de facto amnesty program.\"",
      "Pressed on whether he still believes that, Edlow said \"I do.\""

    "summary": "Netanyahu discussed the Gaza peace plan and defended Israel's actions in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's prepared to \"give peace a chance\" \u2014 but \"the way you purchase peace is through strength,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil Tuesday in Tel Aviv.",
      "Netanyahu spoke to CBS News days after Hamas released the last 20 living hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel's military withdrew from parts of the Gaza Strip, in the first phase of a peace plan brokered by President Trump and Arab states. He weighed in on the future of Gaza, how Israel will react if Hamas doesn't disarm and the criticism Israel has faced during the war.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Could Netanyahu regret releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli hostages?",
      "Netanyahu took a longer view when Dokoupil, in reference to the release of almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in exchange for both the living and deceased Israeli hostages, asked him, \"Are you going to regret this decision?\"",
      "He responded that now, Israel is in a \"much better position\" to pursue Hamas if it fails to abide by the peace plan because there are no longer 20 Israeli hostages \"with their head on the chopping block.\"",
      "Dokoupil noted that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, was released in an exchange with Israel in 2011.",
      "Netanyahu acknowledged that the decision to release thousands of people \u2014 including 250 who were serving life sentences in Israeli prisons \u2014 was \"very painful.\"",
      "\"It's true that the worst ones among them we didn't release, but that's small comfort if your son or daughter was murdered by one of these people who were freed,\" he said.",
      "Releasing the Palestinian prisoners came with the understanding that \"there's an enormous price to pay for the commitment that Israel has to bring our hostages or captives held by the enemy,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Netanyahu claims ratio of civilians to combatants killed in Gaza is \"less than 2 to 1\"",
      "Asked by Dokoupil about the criticism that he's been \"negligent with civilian life in Gaza\" and whether his count of civilian deaths differed from that of the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, Netanyahu estimated \"20,000 Hamas terrorists\" had been killed by Israel.",
      "He added that that was the number \"if you take away the people who die anyway from disease or old age.\"",
      "Netanyahu argued, \"Take away the double counting and so on, the ratio is less than 2 to 1, which is unbelievable in urban conflict.\" It's a figure he also cited at the United Nations General Assembly in September, telling world leaders, \"The ratio of non-combatant to combatant casualties is less than 2 to 1 in Gaza.\"",
      "The Gaza Ministry of Health says nearly 70,000 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023. Its numbers do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. There are also an estimated 11,000 Gazans still missing, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, presumed to be buried beneath the rubble.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday that he believes roughly 60,000 people have died in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu says finishing war \"as speedily as possible\" is \"first fix\" to combat young Americans' negative views of Israel",
      "Netanyahu cited the war's duration as one of the reasons that Americans' have an increasingly negative view of Israel. A Pew poll in late September found only 35% of the respondents had a positive opinion of Israel's government, down from 47% in 2022, before the war started. Among Americans under 30, only 13% said the U.S. was providing \"about the right amount of aid to Israel.\"",
      "\"The first fix is to finish the war as speedily as possible, something that I have sought to do against all this contrarian propaganda,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also blamed social media for fueling the outrage against Israel, saying that \"lies\" about the nation \"obviously does its damage.\"",
      "\"In the TikTok age and in the television age \u2026 letting wars go on too long is going to cost you precisely what it costs you.\" But he added, \"That can recover at least partly when you finish the war and you move on to what I hope will be the era of peace.\"",
      "Netanyahu on Trump saying he's hard to work with: \"I'm very tough\"",
      "In remarks to the Knesset on Monday, Mr. Trump said Netanyahu is \"not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"",
      "Netanyahu appeared to take pride in the characterization.",
      "\"I hope he says that, because I'm very tough on the matters that pertain to my country's future,\" he told Dokoupil. \"My job is to protect the Jewish state and assure the future of the Jewish people.\"",
      "Netanyahu says Hamas must disarm or \"all hell breaks loose\"",
      "\"We agreed to give peace a chance,\" Netanyahu said. But he also maintained that the conditions in Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza are \"very clear:\" Hamas must give up its arms and demilitarize, or \"all hell breaks loose.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has warned that if Hamas does not disarm, \"We will disarm them.\"",
      "\"And it'll happen quickly and perhaps violently,\" the president said. \"But they will disarm.\"",
      "Netanyahu told Dokoupil, \"I hope we can do this peacefully. We're certainly ready to do so.\"",
      "How will the Gaza Strip be governed?",
      "A major unresolved question is who will control the Gaza Strip as Israeli forces withdraw.",
      "Mr. Trump's peace plan calls for control over the territory to be handed over to a technocratic committee made up of Palestinians, overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" that includes Mr. Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Hamas is not supposed to play any role in governance. But beyond that, it's unclear.",
      "Netanyahu said the exact structure for how the territory will be run is unsettled.",
      "Asked by Dokoupil if Blair would run Gaza himself, Netanyahu replied, \"I doubt it.\"",
      "\"But I think that this is a transitional period, and we want to fashion a governance that works, that is not made of people who are committed to our destruction,\" he said. \"We don't want to have the October 7th massacre repeated.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out the idea of allowing an independent Palestinian state, the solution that has been advocated by U.S. allies in Europe and the Arab world.",
      "He told Dokoupil that he supports Palestinians having the power to govern themselves, but would not support a Palestinian state with \"military power.\" \"That sovereign power of security must remain with Israel,\" the prime minister continued.",
      "The Israeli leader said the path forward should involve deradicalization and changes to the Palestinian education system. He also noted that many Gazans are opposed to Hamas or hold the group responsible for inflicting \"horrific misery\" on them.",
      "\"The most important thing in destroying fanaticism is to destroy a certain hope, the hope that the fanaticism will achieve its results,\" Netanyahu said. \"When people know Israel is here to stay, you're not going to destroy the Jewish state, Israel is too strong, that prepares the ground for a change of heart.\""

Other notable guests included oil magnate Harold Hamm, sugar industrialist Pepe Fanjul and Tampa Bay Buccaneers owners Edward and Shari Glazer.",
      "The cryptocurrency industry \u2014 which the Trump administration has sought closer ties to \u2014 was well-represented at the event, including Coinbase, Ripple, Tether and the Winklevoss twins, who founded the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange.",
      "It's not clear how many of Wednesday's roughly 128 attendees have already opened their wallets for the $200 million ballroom project, but Mr. Trump thanked the people in the room for giving \"tremendous amounts of money.\" He said the cost has been \"fully taken care of.\"",
      "\"So many of you have been really, really generous,\" he said. \"A couple of you are sitting here, saying, 'Sir, would $25 million be appropriate?' I said, 'I'll take it.'\"",
      "The Trump administration announced plans to add a 90,000-square-foot ballroom to the East Wing over the summer, with construction breaking ground last month. The administration has called it a long-overdue expansion that will allow the White House to more easily host major functions like state dinners. The president said Wednesday the ballroom will have space for up to 999 guests and bulletproof glass windows on all sides.",
      "The White House says the project will be financed entirely by private donors, rather than taxpayers, setting off a fundraising push, CBS News reported last month. Several companies had pledged $5 million or more, including Google \u2014 which agreed to donate $22 million last month in order to settle a lawsuit from Mr. Trump over his suspension from YouTube after Jan. 6, 2021 \u2014 Booz Allen Hamilton, Lockheed Martin, Palantir and NextEra Energy. The White House is working with the nonprofit Trust for the National Mall to raise money.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration will continue paying FBI agents despite the ongoing government shutdown that has frozen paychecks for nearly all federal workers, FBI Director Kash Patel announced Wednesday.",
      "\"You've found a way to get these individuals paid during a government shutdown,\" Patel said to President Trump during an unrelated Oval Office event. \"On behalf of the FBI, it's a great debt that we owe you.\"",
      "Patel did not specify the source of the funds that would be used to pay the agents.",
      "The announcement follows recent moves by the administration to ensure members of the military receive paychecks this week despite most federal workers going without pay until the government reopens.",
      "\"We got the people that we want paid, paid,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs. \"We want the FBI paid and we want the military paid.\"",
      "Military service members were set to be paid Wednesday after Mr. Trump issued a memo directing the Pentagon to use other unspent funds to make payroll. Around $8 billion in funds from the previous fiscal year had been identified to cover the mid-month paychecks, a Pentagon official said earlier. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also said the Coast Guard, which falls under the purview of her department, would receive paychecks this week from funds in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" that passed earlier this year.",
      "When funding lapsed on Oct. 1, agencies began implementing shutdown procedures to send hundreds of thousands of workers home on furlough. While essential employees and those whose duties are funded through other means stayed on the job, almost no federal workers had been expected to be paid until Congress reopens the government. Workers are expected to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "Under the Justice Department's shutdown plans, no FBI agents were placed on furlough, and only about 10% of department employees overall were expected to be sent home.",
      "The FBI Agents Association thanked Mr. Trump for ensuring agents are paid, but noted that the FBI's workforce also includes people other than agents, including analysts and professional staff. The group called for Congress to reopen the government.",
      "\"If the shutdown continues, the Bureau will be forced to curtail travel, training, hiring, and other vital operations, slowing investigations and weakening coordination with law enforcement partners,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "The administration's moves to pay certain federal workers has prompted questions about its legal authority to do so, since Congress appropriates funds and gives agencies a limited scope for what they can be used for. In previous shutdowns, Congress has voted on stand-alone measures to pay the military. And the Oct. 15 deadline for military paychecks had been widely viewed as a possible off-ramp in the shutdown amid an impasse between the parties that has extended into a third week. But the moves to unilaterally fund the mid-month paychecks took the pressure off lawmakers, at least temporarily.",
      "Republican leaders in Congress tried to resume that pressure on Democrats to reopen the government and pay the military Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson warned that members of the military are in danger of missing their next paycheck later this month if the shutdown continues, calling the administration's move to pay service members a \"temporary fix.\"",
      "Johnson, asked about funds for law enforcement, said he spoke with Mr. Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought at the White House on Tuesday. He said \"they're having to triage federal spending,\" and must determine \"what are the most essential services, personnel, policies and what are not.\"",
      "\"When we look at that, we prioritize troops and law enforcement,\" Johnson said.",
      "Separately, the Trump administration has sought to lay off thousands of federal employees during the shutdown, drawing\u00a0pushback from some Republican lawmakers and prompting a court ruling on Wednesday\u00a0temporarily halting the firings. Mr. Trump said his administration is \"terminating tremendous numbers of Democrat projects.\"",
      "\"We're getting rid of a lot of things that we never wanted because of the fact that they made this stupid move,\" the president told reporters."

    "story": [
      "Even with a U.S. government shutdown beginning on Wednesday, Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients, including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers, wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress. The Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded past Sept. 30.",
      "With no agreement having been reached, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for its operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services. In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan\u00a0published\u00a0by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",
      "According to the new plan, the following are services that would be halted during a shutdown:",

      "IT enhancement activities, public relations and training",
      "Replacement Medicare cards",
      "Overpayments processing",
      "Another aspect of Social Security could be delayed due to a shutdown: the Social Security Administration's annual announcement of the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, to beneficiaries' monthly payments. The COLA is intended to ensure that people's benefits keep up with inflation and that the value of their Social Security income doesn't erode over time.",
      "The SSA announces the annual COLA each October when the Labor Department releases its Consumer Price Index data that month, which this year is scheduled for Oct. 15. But there could be a hitch this year if federal agencies shut down, according to the Labor Department.",
      "\"A delay of the CPI release during October of each year might have an impact on the Cost of Living Adjustment announcement by the Social Security Administration,\" the Labor Department said in issuing a\u00a0contingency plan that covers the impact of a possible shutdown on its operations.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News."

The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",
      "The Defense Department published contingency guidance on Friday, outlining its priority missions and stating that unused funds passed in the reconciliation bill over the summer could be considered to support them. The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care will be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted."

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S. government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies are expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even as lawmakers failed this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "A shutdown began at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1, after the Senate on Tuesday voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",
      "Passport services are also deemed essential and would be expected to operate during a government shutdown."

    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 09:38:44 -0400",
    "summary": "The shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs, since a government shutdown went into effect on Wednesday, Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes were needed to advance it. Democrats wanted an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans opposed. With hours left before the midnight deadline Wednesday, the Senate voted down two competing Democratic and Republican proposals to keep the government funded.",
      "Under the shutdown, federal employees in critical positions are required to stay on the job. Many others will be forced to stay home. Both groups will have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid during a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service\u00a0report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change."

    "summary": "Much of the federal government shut down after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding. Here's what that means.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government shut down Wednesday, October 1, after Congress failed to reach a deal to approve new funding.",
      "Republicans had proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides were dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during the government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich."

    "story": [
      "President Trump confirmed Wednesday that he has authorized the CIA to go into Venezuela and conduct covert operations.",
      "Asked by CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe why he did so, the president said he had two reasons: First, \"they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America\" and \"allowed thousands and thousands of prisoners\" and \"people from mental institutions, insane asylums\" into the U.S. Trump has frequently alleged \u2014 without citing evidence \u2014 that other countries are deliberately sending people from prisons and mental institutions to the southern border.",
      "He also cited the \"drugs coming in from Venezuela.\"",
      "\"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in from the sea. You get to see that,\" he told reporters at the White House in what seemed to be a reference to his administration's military airstrikes against suspected drug traffickers in waters off the coast of Venezuela. \"But we're gonna stop them by land, also.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the president's authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela. Top Trump administration officials have accused Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of controlling the drug cartel Tren de Aragua, which Maduro denies, and the Justice Department has offered a reward for information leading to his capture. In August, the department doubled the bounty to\u00a0$50 million.",
      "Asked Wednesday whether the CIA had the authority to target Maduro, Mr. Trump said it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer,\" but \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat.\"",
      "The Venezuelan government condemned Mr. Trump's \"warmongering and extravagant\" comments in a statement, and accused the U.S. of seeking \"regime change\" in Venezuela.",
      "On Tuesday, the president said that the U.S. had struck another small boat off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people. It was the fifth\u00a0such strike in the Caribbean, where the Trump administration has asserted its authority to treat alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who may be attacked with military force. At least 27 people have been killed in the five strikes, according to figures released by the administration.",
      "Mr. Trump has also deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the region as part of what he has said is as an operation to combat drug smuggling into the United States.",
      "CBS News has also learned there are about 10,000 U.S. forces built up in the Caribbean either on ships or in Puerto Rico.",
      "After the U.S.' latest boat strike, Maduro\u00a0on Wednesday ordered military exercises in the country's biggest shantytowns.",
      "The strikes on alleged drug boats have drawn pushback from lawmakers in both parties. Critics note that Congress hasn't authorized military force against drug traffickers, and argue the Trump administration hasn't provided enough evidence about who was on the boats and what narcotics they were carrying.",
      "Asked by O'Keefe about those concerns, Mr. Trump said lawmakers \"are given information that they were loaded up with drugs, and that's the thing that matters.\" He alleged that \"fentanyl dust\" has been found on the boats after the strikes.",
      "\"When they're loaded up with drugs, they're fair game, and every one of those ships were,\" the president said."

      "New York \u2014 A posthumous memoir by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Roberts Giuffre offers an expanded account about her long-standing claims to have been sexually trafficked by the late financier to billionaires, politicians and Britain's Prince Andrew.",
      "Many Epstein victims have told their stories publicly over the years, but Giuffre always stood apart with her claim to have been \"loaned\" to Epstein's rich and powerful friends and acquaintances.",
      "Titled \"Nobody's Girl: A Memoir of Surviving Abuse and Fighting for Justice,\" the book is set for release Tuesday. It was co-written by author-journalist Amy Wallace, and was completed before Giuffre died by suicide in April.",
      "Giuffre told her story in interviews and lawsuits for 16 years. The book, which she said enabled her to tell her whole story and \"provide context where it has been sorely lacking,\" revisits her allegations involving the men who socialized with Epstein, but carefully so. In many instances, she has left their names out, writing that she either didn't know them or feared retaliation.",
      "But she has added details and a description of how her alleged experiences with Epstein \u2014 after what she said was a traumatic childhood and other instances of sexual abuse \u2014 affected her psychologically and left her struggling to cope.",
      "Giuffre also seeks to explain how she was able to rationalize remaining in what she called \"Epstein's sickening world\" for nearly two years.",
      "\"I needed him not to be a selfish, cruel pedophile. So I told myself he wasn't one,\" she wrote about her mindset at the time.",
      "The start of Giuffre's time with Epstein",
      "Giuffre first met Epstein in the summer of 2000, weeks before she turned 17, while working at the spa at now-President Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.",
      "In the book, she retells the story of being hired by Epstein's longtime companion, Ghislaine Maxwell, to work as a \"masseuse\" for Epstein.",
      "She said Epstein and Maxwell coaxed her into performing sex acts during massages, then began taking her to his luxurious homes in New York, the U.S. Virgin Islands and New Mexico, where she says she met \u2014 and sometimes was directed to have sex with \u2014 numerous famous friends and acquaintances of Epstein.",
      "Maxwell has denied participating in any sexual abuse and called Giuffre's account of being trafficked a lie, as have all of the men she has publicly accused.",
      "Giuffre and Prince Andrew",
      "In the book, Giuffre details alleged encounters with Prince Andrew, who she sued in 2021, claiming that they had sex when she was 17. Andrew denied her claims and the two settled the lawsuit in 2022.",
      "In an excerpt published by The Guardian, Giuffre says, \"He was friendly enough, but still entitled \u2014 as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.\"",
      "Giuffre added that, \"The next morning, Maxwell told me: 'You did well. The prince had fun.' Epstein would give me $15,000 for servicing the man the tabloids called 'Randy Andy.'\"",
      "Speculation that Epstein was involved in a global sex trafficking ring continues to cause headaches for the Trump administration, which has been under pressure to publicly release more records related to the FBI's investigations of Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Even Giuffre, in the concluding pages of the book, asks: \"Where are those videotapes the FBI confiscated from Epstein's houses? And why haven't they led to the prosecution of any more abusers?\"",
      "In the book, she describes meeting Trump once at Mar-a-Lago, where her father worked, but doesn't accuse Trump of wrongdoing.",
      "Trump \"couldn't have been friendlier,\" Giuffre said, adding that he offered to help her find babysitting work.",
      "Giuffre also mentions that she was once present for dinners Epstein had with former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, but she also didn't accuse them of any wrongdoing.",
      "Giuffre broke off contact with Epstein in 2002.",
      "Three years later, Palm Beach police began investigating Epstein after the parents of another teenage girl reported that their daughter had also been paid for a sex act. Police identified multiple underage girls with similar stories about being hired to give sexualized massages, but the investigation ended in 2008 when Epstein pleaded guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. He served 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence.",
      "In the book, Giuffre wrote that Epstein and Maxwell persuaded her to become a recruiter who found other girls who would perform sexualized massages on Epstein \u2014 something she called \"the worst thing I've ever done in my life.\"",
      "\"The faces of the girls I recruited will always haunt me,\" she wrote.",
      "Federal prosecutors in New York brought new charges against Epstein in 2019 but, authorities say, he killed himself in jail as he awaited trial. Maxwell was convicted in 2021 of charges including sex trafficking and is serving a 20-year prison sentence. Giuffre wasn't part of either case.",
      "CBS News and The Associated Press typically do not name people who say they are the victims of sexual abuse unless they have come forward publicly with their stories, as Giuffre has."

    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 05:00:16 -0400",
    "summary": "States are battling for their piece of $50 billion in federal rural health funding, but it's not just hospitals vying for the money. Tech startups and policy demands are raising the stakes as Medicaid cuts loom.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 Nationwide, states are racing to win their share of a new $50 billion rural health fund. But helping rural hospitals, as originally envisioned, is quickly becoming a quaint idea.",
      "Rather, states should submit applications that \"rebuild and reshape\" how health care is delivered in rural communities, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services official Abe Sutton said late last month during a daylong meeting at D.C.'s Watergate Hotel. Simply changing the way government pays hospitals has been tried and has failed, Sutton told the audience of more than 40 governors' office staffers and state health agency leaders \u2014 some from as far away as Hawaii.",
      "\"This isn't a backfill of operating budgets,\" said Sutton, CMS' innovation director. \"We've been really clear on that.\"",
      "Rural hospitals and clinics nationwide face a looming financial catastrophe, with President Trump's massive tax-and-spending law expected to slash federal Medicaid spending on health care in rural areas by $137 billion over 10 years. Congressional Republicans added the one-time, five-year Rural Health Transformation Program as a last-minute sweetener to win the support of conservative holdouts who worried about the bill's financial fallout for rural hospitals.",
      "Yet, the words used by CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz and his agency's leaders to describe the new pot of cash are generating tension between legacy hospital and clinic providers and new technology-focused companies stepping in to offer new ways to deliver health care.",
      "It's \"what I would call incumbents versus insurgents in the rural space,\" said Kody Kinsley, a senior policy adviser at the Institute for Policy Solutions at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing.",
      "Applications are due Nov. 5. The money will be awarded to states by the end of the year and distributed over five years.",
      "Half of the $50 billion will be divided equally among all states with an approved application; the other half will go to states that win points. Of the second half, $12.5 billion will be allotted based on a formula that calculates each state's rurality. The remaining $12.5 billion will go to states that score well on initiatives and policies that mirror the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" objectives.",
      "The application identifies specific policy goals such as implementing the Presidential Fitness Test and restrictions to food assistance, as well as broader investment strategies around remote care services, data infrastructure, and consumer-facing technology tools, which CMS identified as \"symptom checkers and AI chatbots.\"",
      "In September, after CMS officials released the application, Republican members of Congress from states with Democratic governors called for fairness, concerned their states might direct the money to urban areas. In a letter to Oz and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., they said the money \"will serve as a lifeline for rural and at-risk hospitals in our communities that are already struggling to keep their doors open.\"",
      "Smaller hospitals fear they will get \"a tiny little slice\" of each state's share, said Emily Felder, who leads the health care practice at Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, a law firm whose clients include rural hospital systems.",
      "\"There's a lot of frustration,\" Felder said.",
      "But Kinsley, who was previously North Carolina's secretary of health and human services, said using this money only to shore up a balance sheet \"is really just throwing good money after bad.\" In contrast, he said, insurgents such as technology-driven startups can offer new strategies.",
      "One of those companies vying for funding is Homeward Health, a Silicon Valley-based company that contracts with Medicare managed care insurers. Using artificial intelligence analytics, Homeward helps patients get care in their home and with local providers.",
      "The company manages the health of 100,000 rural Michigan patients enrolled in insurance, said Homeward co-founder and chief executive Jennifer Schneider. The company was a sponsor for the Watergate summit. It also has ongoing meetings with Oz and his team, Schneider said.",
      "\"They're doing their job, and they're talking to a lot of people in the ecosystem and really eager to learn from those of us that have been in the system,\" Schneider said. \"We're one of many in that position.\"",
      "KFF Health News requested an interview with Alina Czekai, director of the newly created Office of Rural Health Transformation. CMS spokesperson Alexx Pons said the agency was \"unable to accommodate facilitation of any interview.\"",
      "Instead, CMS provided an emailed statement from Oz saying the program \"will help states and communities reimagine what's possible for rural healthcare.\"",
      "Brock Slabach, chief operations officer of the National Rural Health Association, the largest organization representing rural hospitals and clinics, said the money would best be used to help pay for transformation that isn't \"sexy\" or \"revolutionary.\"",
      "\"If what we end up with is we have a wearable for every rural patient, I don't think that's transformational,\" Slabach said, referring to digital health monitors such as fitness-tracking watches.",
      "Slabach, a onetime small-hospital chief executive and an unofficial adviser to hundreds of rural facilities nationwide, named a few ideas for the money \u2014 including paying for capital improvements such as electronic health records or equipment, loan repayment programs to aid workforce development, and creating \"SWAT\" teams that rescue rural hospitals on the brink of closure.",
      "More than 150 rural hospitals have closed nationwide since 2010 \u2014 a statistic cited by CMS' Sutton that is well known among industry watchers. The Sheps Center at the University of North Carolina, which compiles the closure data, also released a guide to help states calculate how rural they are for their applications.",
      "State applications will be reviewed by a panel, with some reviewers from within the government but others outside it, said Kate Sapra, acting deputy director of the Office of Rural Health Transformation, speaking at the Watergate.",
      "\"We will train them in the scoring criteria,\" Sapra said, adding that the panelists will not be coming from \"your state\" and will need to fill out conflict-of-interest forms. A portion of money each state gets will be reevaluated annually based on the progress it makes on its goals and priorities, according to CMS.",
      "States are creating stakeholder groups, asking for public comment, and working with their health agencies. Some, such as Mississippi and New Mexico, are hiring consultants.",
      "In Montana, a collection of health providers and associations proposed a list of ideas for the cash, including creating a loan repayment fund for rural clinicians to try to ease worker shortages.",
      "\"It's one-time money, and it's a little bit of money,\" said David Mark, a doctor who is the CEO of One Health, which has clinics dotted across eastern Montana and Wyoming. A state could receive a minimum of $100 million a year for five years if all 50 states have applications approved.",
      "\"How do you accomplish goals of a health care system transformation with an infusion of money like that?\" Mark said.",
      "Neither Montana nor Wyoming \u2014 vast, rural states \u2014 sent leaders to the Watergate summit, according to a copy of the attendees list. In the afternoon, attendees could rotate among planning tables and meet with corporate sponsors such as the electronic health records behemoth Epic and the emergency services company Global Medical Response.",
      "Wyoming Department of Health Deputy Director Franz Fuchs confirmed his state did not send representatives to the event, because they were \"stretched with other commitments.\" Montana, Wyoming, and other states submitted an optional letter of intent signaling they will apply for the funds. CMS did not respond to questions about how many and which states have submitted letters.",
      "During the Watergate event, hints of brewing competition among states began to surface.",
      "\"I think Arkansas' application is going to be better than yours,\" seasoned political adviser Jack Sisson said with a smile during a morning panel.",
      "The audience laughed. Sisson, who recently left his job as health adviser for Arkansas Gov. Sarah Sanders, had interrupted Michael Hendrix, policy adviser to another Republican governor, Tennessee's Bill Lee.",
      "\"See, this is the kind of friendly competition that CMS is hoping for,\" Hendrix said. He grinned, thanked Sisson, and added, \"I look forward to us both winning.\"",
      "KFF Health News Montana correspondent Katheryn Houghton contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems.",
    "story": [
      "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday issued a sweeping emergency order directing all federal agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in certain devices and software made by F5, a technology vendor, after confirming a nation-state cyber actor gained unauthorized access to F5's source code.",
      "CISA \u2014 a part of the Department of Homeland Security that manages risks to the U.S.'s cyber and physical infrastructure \u2014 issued\u00a0Emergency Directive 26-01\u00a0following the company's disclosure that a foreign threat actor had maintained long-term, persistent access to its internal development and engineering environments using source code.",
      "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems. F5 said it first discovered the attack in August but did not disclose exactly when it began.",
      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" Nick Anderson, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",
      "F5 is a publicly traded American technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.",
      "Justice Department delayed breach announcement",
      "Earlier Wednesday, F5 disclosed the breach in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "In the SEC 8-K report, F5 said the Justice Department on Sept. 12 \"determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted.\" It's one of the first times a company has publicly acknowledged DOJ intervention under the SEC's\u00a0cybersecurity disclosure rules.",
      "The rules were adopted in July 2023 and require companies to report cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining that a material event has occurred.",
      "\"Under item 1.05(c), the Department may grant a delay after finding that a disclosure required by Item 1.05 would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety,\" a Department of Justice spokesperson told CBS News in a statement.",
      "F5 CEO Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou signed the filing, which said the company learned of the attack on Aug. 9 and launched an investigation alongside cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike, Mandiant and others, with assistance from federal law enforcement and unnamed \"government partners.\"",
      "\"During the course of its investigation, the Company determined that the threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to certain F5 systems, including the BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platform,\" F5 wrote in its filing.",
      "What's in the CISA emergency order",
      "CISA's order directed federal civilian executive branch agencies \u2014 which include the Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of the Treasury and the Federal Trade Commission, among others \u2014 to inventory F5 BIG-IP products, which are application delivery and security services.",
      "The federal agencies need to evaluate if their networks are accessible from the public internet, and apply newly released updates from F5 by Oct. 22, the emergency order stated. They must also complete scoping reports identifying affected devices by Oct. 29.",
      "There are currently thousands of F5 devices in use across federal networks, Anderson told CBS News. The cybersecurity agency said it expects to know more about the scope of exposure by the end of the month.",
      "CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement that the agency remains \"steadfast\" in its mission to defend U.S. networks, even amid the ongoing government shutdown and the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.",
      "\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited demands immediate and decisive action,\" Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend beyond federal systems \u2014 to any organization using this technology.\"",
      "No confirmed compromises yet, but broader campaign underway",
      "Anderson confirmed that CISA is not aware of any current data breaches within federal agencies, though the directive is designed to uncover any potential compromises. He said the campaign appears to be part of a broader nation-state effort targeting elements of the U.S. technology supply chain, not just one vendor.",
      "\"The broader goal here is persistent access \u2014 to gather intelligence, hold infrastructure hostage, or position themselves for future attacks,\" Anderson told CBS News during Wednesday's briefing.",
      "CISA declined to name the country behind the attack, citing ongoing investigations.",
      "\"The U.S. government is not making a public attribution at this time,\" said Marcy McCarthy, CISA's director of public affairs.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",
      "Working through the government shutdown",
      "Pressed on the government's ability to respond amid furloughs and staffing reductions at CISA, Anderson acknowledged the agency's challenges but said it remains operational.",
      "\"We're sustaining essential functions and providing timely guidance like this to mitigate risk,\" he said. \"This is core mission work for CISA \u2014 exactly what we should be doing.\"",
      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

    "story": [
      "The State Department said Tuesday it has revoked the visas of six people for making incendiary social media comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "The six people \u2014 none of whom were named \u2014 hailed from Argentina, South Africa, Mexico, Brazil, Germany and Paraguay, the department said in a series of X posts. Some of them made comments that suggested Kirk deserved to be killed.",
      "\"The United States has no obligation to host foreigners who wish death on Americans,\" the State Department wrote on X. \"The State Department continues to identify visa holders who celebrated the heinous assassination of Charlie Kirk.\"",
      "The State Department did not specify whether any of the people are currently in the U.S. or what types of visas they held. CBS News has reached out to the department for further information.",
      "A day after Kirk was killed on a Utah college campus, a top State Department official vowed to take \"appropriate action\" against any visa-holders who praise or make light of Kirk's death \u2014 and invited people to send in any concerning posts that they see.",
      "Days later, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said, \"visa revocations are under way.\"",
      "Kirk was shot and killed on Sept. 10 while speaking to students at Utah Valley University for an event put on by Turning Point USA, a group he co-founded. Authorities said the gunman shot Kirk using a rifle from the roof of a nearby campus building.",
      "Following a two-day manhunt, a 22-year-old Utah man identified as Tyler Robinson was arrested in the killing. State prosecutors have charged Robinson with aggravated murder.",
      "The revocations are part of a wider crackdown on comments that mock or celebrate Kirk's death. The Pentagon and the Secret Service have sidelined service members or agents who wrote negative social media posts about Kirk, and Vice President JD Vance has encouraged people to call the employers of anybody who celebrates Kirk's killing.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to revoke visas in other circumstances, too. It is pushing to deport several international students who are linked to campus protests against Israel's war in the Gaza Strip, accusing them of antisemitic rhetoric, which the students have denied. And it revoked Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa last month for encouraging U.S. troops to disobey President Trump's orders during a protest in New York.",
      "Social media comments are also being monitored by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency responsible for processing immigration and naturalization applications. In August, USCIS directed its officials to\u00a0investigate applicants for \"anti-American views and activities.\"",
      "\"There has been such a large-scale espousing of foreign terrorist ideology, whether it's Hamas or another organization, that has been matched with a clear desire by these elements to trample on the right of other people around them,\" USCIS Director Joseph Edlow told CBS News in an interview on Wednesday.",
      "When asked whether he's talking about legally protected speech, Edlow said, \"People are free to make whatever statements they want on social media or anywhere else and anyone who, you know, doesn't support the same candidate that I support.\"",
      "\"That is not what we're talking about here ... we're talking about people who are actively supporting that violent overthrow of this country or otherwise providing material support to terrorist organizations across the world,\" he added.",
      "The government's legal power to deny or revoke visas on speech grounds is an unresolved question, Eugene Volokh, a UCLA professor emeritus of law who has written extensively about the First Amendment, told CBS News last month. The Supreme Court has ruled that the government has broad latitude to refuse to admit people into the country, but whether federal officials can deport people who are already in the U.S. due to their speech is less clear.",
      "Volokh said noncitizens \"have the same First Amendment protections against, say, criminal punishment or civil liability as citizens do.\"",
      "\"But when it comes to the question of deportation or exclusion from the country in the first place, the rules turn out to be unsettled,\" he said."

      "But to even have the chance to do so, Democrat Janet Mills will first have to make it through what is already primed to be a contentious Senate primary between establishment voices and progressives at a crucial time in her party.",
      "Mills announced on Tuesday that she will run in Maine's 2026 Senate contest, offering Democrats one route to try to unseat the longtime GOP incumbent Collins and thin out the Republican Senate majority in Washington.",
      "\"I won't sit idly by while Maine people suffer and politicians like Susan Collins bend the knee as if this were normal,\" Mills said in an announcement video posted early Tuesday. \"My life's work has prepared me for this fight, and I'm ready to win. This election will be a simple choice: Is Maine going to bow down or stand up? I know my answer.\"",
      "CBS News reported last week\u00a0that Mills was expected to launch her campaign on Tuesday.",
      "The 77-year-old governor has been viewed as a key recruiting target for national Democrats, who face long odds of flipping control of the Senate back next year given a difficult map of races. Mills was first elected governor after winning by more than seven points in 2018, and she won reelection by a 13-point margin four years later.",
      "But recent political history, both locally and across the country, may upend expectations about how Mills will fare in what could become one of the tensest contests of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Collins has served as one of Maine's senators since 1997, establishing herself as a key moderate Republican voice, albeit one who tends to frustrate members of both major parties at times. During the 2020 presidential election, defeating Collins was a major, and well-funded, priority for Democrats. But Collins still managed to win re-election by more than eight points, even as Democrat Joe Biden's statewide margin over President Trump in Maine was nine points.",
      "The 72-year-old Collins has never lost a Senate race in Maine, her last defeat coming in a run for governor back in 1994.",
      "Mills' expected entry into the Senate race is already being met with some dismissiveness on the progressive side. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is an independent but caucuses with Democrats, is rallying around Graham Platner, a younger first-time statewide candidate who is already in the Senate race and, according to his online campaign bio, is a military veteran and oyster farmer.",
      "\"Graham Platner is a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins,\" Sanders said recently on social media. \"It's disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run. We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary.\"",
      "In the fallout from a difficult 2024 election cycle where Democrats lost the presidency and Senate, and failed to retake control of the House, there have been persistent questions about how the party can recover. One tension rippling through the party is the subject of generational change, and whether to eschew the older candidates closer in age to Biden, 82, and instead nominate people who can try to revive a Democratic brand that has suffered in recent years.",
      "With Mills' entry into the race on Tuesday, Democrats in Maine may be on a collision course over those national concerns already rippling through other contests where the party's future direction could be at stake."

      "Comey and Mr. Trump have had a contentious relationship for years. Comey, who was FBI director when Mr. Trump took office in 2017, was fired later that year by the president. Initially, the White House indicated he had been ousted over his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server, but the president later told NBC News' Lester Holt that he had the FBI's Russia investigation on his mind and had terminated Comey because of \"this Russia thing with Trump and Russia.\"",
      "That firing ultimately set into motion special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\" Mueller's probe found that Russia interfered in the election and several Trump campaign officials had contacts with Russians, but did not establish that campaign staff illegally conspired with the Russian government.",
      "For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him \"morally unfit\" to be president in a 2018 interview.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund also contended that \"prosecutors should never be fired for refusing to bring charges they conclude are unfounded, even if the president orders them to do so. Yet that appears to be just what President Trump has done in order to charge Mr. Comey and Ms. James.\"",
      "The criminal cases were filed against Comey and James less than three weeks after President Trump called for their prosecution in a post on social media.",
      "The acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who had been appointed to the position by Mr. Trump, resigned after he did not bring prosecutions of Comey and James, and the president announced he had been fired. A Trump White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, was then installed as acting U.S. attorney and within days secured grand jury indictments against Comey and James \u2014 with prosecutors charging Comey less than a week before the statute of limitations ran out.",
      "Halligan has defended both of the prosecutions. In the hours after James's indictment last week, Halligan said in a statement, \"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.\"",
      "After charging Comey, Halligan said, \"The charges as alleged in this case represent a breach of the public trust at an extraordinary level,\"",
      "Comey is charged with making a false statement and obstruction of Congress, for allegedly lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 when he denied that he had authorized someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports. Comey has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "During an arraignment proceeding last week, Comey's defense attorney told a judge that Comey would seek a dismissal of the case next week, arguing the case is an unlawful vindictive prosecution against one of the president's critics.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund's request for a federal review of Halligan's cases also argued, \"The same pattern has now been repeated a second time in as many weeks with respect to another victim of President Trump's wrath. Ms. Halligan's prosecution of Letitia James on two counts of 'bank fraud' and a 'false statement' appears to be a further attempt to fulfill President Trump's personal vendetta against his political enemies.\"",
      "\"Trump's animus against Ms. James stems from having successfully brought a years-long civil fraud case against the Trump Organization, which included judgments against President Trump and two of his sons and imposed a court monitor with limits on their ability to conduct business in New York,\" the fund's letter continued.",
      "James is scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 24, to answer to charges of mortgage fraud and false statement in connection with a Norfolk, Virginia, home in 2020. James has also denied wrongdoing.",
      "The Office of the Justice Department Inspector General is on furlough because of the shutdown and did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment."

    "summary": "Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
    "story": [
      "Portland, Maine \u2014 Leaf-peeping season has arrived in the Northeast and beyond, but weeks of drought have dulled this year's autumn colors and sent leaves fluttering to the ground earlier than usual.",
      "Soaking in the fall foliage is an annual tradition in the New England states as well as areas such as the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, Great Smoky Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina and Upper Peninsula of Michigan. As the days shorten and temperatures drop, chlorophyll in leaves breaks down, and they turn to the autumn tones of yellow, orange and red.",
      "But dry weather in summer and fall can change all that because the lack of water causes leaves to brown and fall more quickly. And that's happening this year, as more than 40% of the country was considered to be in a drought in early October, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.",
      "That's more than twice the average, said Brad Rippey, a U.S. Department of Agriculture meteorologist and an author of the drought monitor, which is a partnership between the federal government and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. Drought has hit the Northeast and western U.S. especially hard, he said.",
      "It all adds up to fewer leaves to peep.",
      "\"I think it might be a little bit of a short and less colorful season, for the most part,\" Rippey said. \"The color is just not going to be there this year for some hillsides.\"",
      "Despite the gloomy forecast, autumn enthusiasts said it's still a great year to get out and enjoy nature's fireworks display. There is still a lot of color in New England's trees, said Andy Finton, senior conservation ecologist with The Nature Conservancy in Massachusetts.",
      "Climate change is stressing forests with severe weather and heat waves, but autumn in New England remains a beautiful time of year to experience the wonderment of forest ecosystems firsthand, he said.",
      "\"Our trees and our forests have an inherent resilience,\" Finton said. \"They are still very resilient, and I am constantly surprised at how wonderful the fall season is despite these stresses.\"",
      "Leaf-peepers undeterred for most part",
      "The tourism business built around leaf peeping has also proven resilient. At the Mills Falls Resort Collection at the Lake in Meredith, New Hampshire, general manager Barbara Beckwith said business is good at the four inns that have 170 rooms. The number of Canadian tourists is down, Beckwith acknowledged, but she said that's been made up with domestic leaf peepers, mostly from New England.",
      "Beckwith said her properties were booked solid on weekends through mid-October and had been for weeks.",
      "\"This year is actually going to be better than last year,\" Beckwith said. \"Last year was an election and that put a lot of trepidation in people. Now, they are traveling. The uncertainty of the election is over. We all know whose president now and we are traveling.\"",
      "Chris Proulx, executive director of the Mount Washington (New Hampshire) Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the decline in Canadian tourists by as much as 80% seen this summer has continued into the fall. But the region is faring better, he said, thanks to an uptick in travelers from other countries and its reputation for having one of the country's best leaf peeping seasons.",
      "\"This is the one season where people make plans in advance to come in addition to travelers from all of the country and all over the world,\" Proulx said.",
      "Leaf peeping was so popular in Colorado's Rocky Mountains this year that one town temporarily closed its highway offramp to alleviate gridlock. The area put on a display of yellow aspen trees dotting the mountains between evergreens, their delicate leaves vibrating in the wind.",
      "But there were signs of a dry spring in the central part of the state, one that is more severe the farther west you travel, said Colorado State Forest Service entomologist Dan West, who spends many fall days in a plane looking at how insect infestations are affecting tree health.",
      "Crispy edges, muted colors, and dropping leaves before they can take on a red or purple hue are all signs of drought stress, West said.",
      "\"The tree is shutting down processes early and we basically just see this muted kind of a show for the fall,\" he said.",
      "In Denver, arborist Michael Sundberg also said he's seeing less vibrant color than usual, and autumn feels like it arrived earlier than usual this year. It's still a beautiful time of year, but there might be less of it to enjoy, he said.",
      "\"It's weird to have color peaking this early in the mountains and then for Denver to be peaking at the same time,\" he said. \"Usually we're later in October before we really go off.\""

    "summary": "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially, the IUCN said as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
    "story": [
      "Arctic seals are being pushed closer to extinction by climate change and more than half of bird species around the world are declining under pressure from deforestation and agricultural expansion, according to an annual assessment from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "One bright spot is green sea turtles, which have recovered substantially thanks to decades of conservation efforts, the IUCN said Friday as it released its latest Red List of Threatened Species.",
      "While many animals are increasingly at risk of disappearing forever, the updated list shows how species can come back from the brink with dedicated effort, Rima Jabado, deputy chair of the IUCN Species Survival Commission, told The Associated Press.",
      "\"Hope and concern go hand in hand in this work,\" Jabado wrote by email. \"The same persistence that brought back the green sea turtle can be mirrored in small, everyday actions \u2014 supporting sustainable choices, backing conservation initiatives, and urging leaders to follow through on their environmental promises.\"",
      "The list is updated every year by teams of scientists assessing data on creatures around the world. The scope of the work is enormous and important for science, said Andrew Farnsworth, a visiting scientist at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology who studies bird migration and wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "\"Every time one is done and every time there's revision, there's more information, and there's more ability to answer questions\" on species, some of which are still largely a mystery to researchers, Farnsworth said.",
      "Sea ice loss",
      "Because all the marine mammals native to the Arctic \u2014 seals, whales and polar bears \u2014 rely on the habitat provided by sea ice, they're all at risk as it diminishes because of human-caused climate change, said Kit Kovacs, co-chair of IUCN's Species Survival Commission Pinniped Specialist Group, which focuses on seals.",
      "The three species highlighted in the latest IUCN report \u2014 harp, hooded and bearded seals \u2014 have been moved up to a designation of greater concern in the latest update, indicating they are increasingly threatened by extinction, Kovacs said.",
      "The same melting of glaciers and sea ice destroying seal habitats also \"generally will bring escalation in extreme weather events, which are already impacting people around the globe,\" wrote Kovacs.",
      "\"Acting to help seals is acting to help humanity when it comes to climate change,\" Kovacs said.",
      "Global bird decline",
      "The update also highlighted Madagascar, West Africa and Central America, where Schlegel's asity, the black-casqued hornbill and the tail-bobbing northern nightingale-wren were all moved to near-threatened status. Those are three specific birds in trouble, but numbers are dropping for around three-fifths of birds globally.",
      "\"That three in five of the world's bird species have declining populations shows how deep the biodiversity crisis has become and how urgent it is that governments take the actions they have committed to under multiple conventions and agreements,\" said Ian Burfield, global science coordinator at BirdLife International.",
      "Deforestation of tropical forests is one of a \"depressing litany of threats\" to birds, a list that includes agricultural expansion and intensification, competition from invasive species and climate change, said Stuart Butchart, chief scientist at BirdLife International.",
      "\"The fact that 61% of the world's birds are declining is an alarm bell that we can't afford to ignore,\" Butchart said.",
      "The annual U.N. climate summit will be held in November in Belem, Brazil, with much attention on the Amazon and the value of tropical forests to humans and animals. But Farnsworth, of Cornell, said he was \"not so confident\" that world's leaders would take decisive action to protect imperiled bird species.",
      "\"I would like to think things like birds are nonpartisan, and you can find common ground,\" he said. \"But it's not easy.\"",
      "Green sea turtles",
      "One success story is the rebound of green sea turtles in many parts of the world's oceans. Experts see that as a bright spot because it shows how effective human interventions, like legal protections and conservation programs, can be.",
      "Still, \"it's important to note that conservation efforts of sea turtles can take decades before you realize the fruits of that labor,\" said Justin Perrault, vice president of research at Loggerhead Marinelife Center in Juno Beach, Florida, who wasn't involved with the IUCN report.",
      "The overall success with green sea turtles should be celebrated and used as an example with other species, some of which, like hawksbills and leatherbacks, aren't doing nearly as well, said Nicolas Pilcher, executive director of the Marine Research Foundation.",
      "And even for green sea turtles, areas still remain where climate change and other factors like erosion are damaging habitats, Pilcher said, and some of those are poorer communities that receive less conservation funding.",
      "But in the places where they have recovered, it's \"a great story of, actually, we can do something about this,\" Pilcher said. \"We can. We can make a difference.\"",
      "Extinct species",
      "The latest Red List notes that six species have moved to the extinct category. The IUCN says those species include the Christmas Island shrew and the slender-billed curlew, a migratory shorebird.",

The group published a study on the new finding in the October issue of its scientific journal, the\u00a0Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.",
      "While ORCs detected in the past looked like one bright circle, this one consisted of two intersecting rings, which is rare. Previously, research into ORCs suggested the rings could be caused by shockwaves that were triggered by the merging of supermassive black holes or galaxies, but the latest findings propose that they actually could be linked to \"superwind\" flowing out of their host galaxies, the Royal Astronomical Society said.",
      "\"ORCs are among the most bizarre and beautiful cosmic structures we've ever seen \u2014 and they may hold vital clues about how galaxies and black holes co-evolve, hand-in-hand,\" Ananda Hota, the founder of the\u00a0RAD@home Astronomy Collaboratory, a platform where citizen scientists helped spot the ORC, said in a statement.",
      "\"The fact that citizen scientists uncovered them highlights the continued importance of human pattern recognition, even in the age of machine learning,\" Pratik Dabhade, of the National Centre for Nuclear Research in Warsaw, Poland, who co-authored the study, said in a separate statement. \"These discoveries show that ORCs and radio rings are not isolated curiosities \u2013 they are part of a broader family of exotic plasma structures shaped by black hole jets, winds, and their environments.\""

      "A weak spot in the Earth's magnetic field is growing over the South Atlantic Ocean, according to more than a decade's worth of satellite data collected by scientists.",
      "The magnetic field surrounding Earth protects the planet from cosmic radiation and particles charged by the sun. Scientists believe it is generated by the outer core of the Earth, according to a news release from the European Space Agency. The ESA said the \"global ocean of molten, swirling liquid iron\" in that layer of the planet creates electrical currents that generate the magnetic field.",
      "The weak spot, known as the South Atlantic Anomaly, was first identified in the 19th century, the ESA said. It is southeast of South America and southwest of Africa. In this area, the planet's magnetic field dips down, according to NASA. Satellites that pass over it are hit with higher doses of incoming radiation, which can cause technical issues and even blackouts.",
      "The ESA studied the spot for 11 years, from 2014 to 2025. Three different satellites, known as Swarm, precisely measured the planet's magnetic signals during that period. The data was published in the journal Science Direct.",
      "The satellite data showed that the South Atlantic Anomaly had expanded by an area \"nearly half the size of continental Europe,\" or about two million square miles. The speed of the area's weakening has increased since 2020, the ESA said, with different parts of the anomaly changing at different rates.",
      "\"The South Atlantic Anomaly is not just a single block,\" says lead author Chris Finlay, Professor of Geomagnetism at the Technical University of Denmark, in the ESA's news release. \"It's changing differently towards Africa than it is near South America. There's something special happening in this region that is causing the field to weaken in a more intense way.\"",
      "Finlay said that magnetic field lines emitting from the core are bouncing back into it. It's not clear why this is happening, but it is contributing to the anomaly's weakening in those areas, the ESA said.",
      "The ESA satellites found other changes in the Earth's magnetic field. In the southern hemisphere, there is another area where the magnetic field is particularly strong. Two other anomalies exist in the northern hemisphere: One near Canada and one over Siberia. Both are stronger than the rest of the field. However, the one near Canada has shrunk by an area the size of India, while the one over Siberia has grown by an area the size of Greenland, the ESA said.",
      "The satellites will continue to study the planet's magnetic field in the coming years, the ESA said.",
      "\"It's really wonderful to see the big picture of our dynamic Earth thanks to Swarm's extended timeseries,\" Swarm Mission manager Anja Stromme said in a statement. \"The satellites are all healthy and providing excellent data, so we can hopefully extend that record beyond 2030, when the solar minimum will allow more unprecedented insights into our planet.\""

      "\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited demands immediate and decisive action,\" Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend beyond federal systems \u2014 to any organization using this technology.\"",
      "No confirmed compromises yet, but broader campaign underway",
      "Anderson confirmed that CISA is not aware of any current data breaches within federal agencies, though the directive is designed to uncover any potential compromises. He said the campaign appears to be part of a broader nation-state effort targeting elements of the U.S. technology supply chain, not just one vendor.",
      "\"The broader goal here is persistent access \u2014 to gather intelligence, hold infrastructure hostage, or position themselves for future attacks,\" Anderson told CBS News during Wednesday's briefing.",
      "CISA declined to name the country behind the attack, citing ongoing investigations.",
      "\"The U.S. government is not making a public attribution at this time,\" said Marcy McCarthy, CISA's director of public affairs.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",
      "Working through the government shutdown",
      "Pressed on the government's ability to respond amid furloughs and staffing reductions at CISA, Anderson acknowledged the agency's challenges but said it remains operational.",
      "\"We're sustaining essential functions and providing timely guidance like this to mitigate risk,\" he said. \"This is core mission work for CISA \u2014 exactly what we should be doing.\"",
      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

    "story": [
      "Instagram-parent Meta announced Tuesday that teen users will now see content on Instagram that's similar to what they might see while watching a film with a PG-13 rating.",
      "That's because new content settings for Instagram users under 18 will adhere to the same regulations. The new automatic protections are being rolled by the company starting Tuesday and will be fully implemented by the end of the year, according to Meta.",
      "\"We hope this update reassures parents that we're working to show teens safe, age-appropriate content on Instagram by default, while also giving them more ways to shape their teen's experience,\" the company said in the announcement.",
      "PG-13, a rating used in the media industry, indicates that parental guidance is suggested when watching content, particularly for children under 13.",
      "What are the new restrictions?",
      "The accounts of Instagram users under 18 will now be automatically be placed under a 13+ setting. Opting out of the setting will require parental permission.",
      "Teens with the setting will be blocked from seeing search results for terms like \"alcohol\" or \"gore.\" This adds to list of search topics from which Meta said it already shields teens, such as suicide, self-harm and eating disorders.",
      "Teens will also be prevented from following accounts that regularly posts content deemed age-inappropriate. Instagram users under 18 who already follow such accounts, will no longer be able to see or interact with their content, send them DMs, or see their comments under anyone's posts.",
      "Meta is also applying the new regulations to its artificial intelligence technology which is integrated into Instagram to help answer users' questions. \"A.I.s should not give age-inappropriate responses that would feel out of place in a PG-13 movie,\" Meta said Tuesday.",
      "The social media company is also unveiling a separate setting for parents who prefer a \"more restrictive experience for their teen.\" That setting, called \"Limited Content,\" filters more content out from teens' feeds while also restricting their ability to see, leave or receive comments on posts.",
      "Meta introduced \"Teen Accounts\" last year, billing the move as a way to protect the safety of its younger user base. The company's new teen restrictions follow similar announcements by\u00a0YouTube\u00a0and\u00a0OpenAI."

      "\"At a certain point it was, 'tell me what your address is' and when he said no, he's like, 'Well, I have these photos of you, I'll tell your parents,'\" Steven said of the interaction between the predator and his son back in July 2024. \"He was 30 feet down the hall from us and just\u2014 felt too trapped to \u2026 come and talk to us.\"",

    "summary": "David Pogue looks at our nation's tradition of pioneering inventors, from Thomas Edison's R&amp;D facility in Menlo Park, N.J., to today's entrepreneurs pitching their ideas to \"Shark Tank.\"",
    "story": [
      "If you plot the origins of the greatest inventions in history, you start to notice a pattern: The light bulb, the phonograph, the airplane, air conditioning, the zipper, the microwave, lasers, transistors, the personal computer, the internet, GPS, the smartphone \u2026 No country on Earth has as rich a history of modern invention as this one.",
      "But my question is, why is that? Well, the answer may start with a guy from Ohio: Thomas Edison, who we know as the inventor of the light bulb.",
      "\"Kind of,\" notes Hal Wallace, a curator at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. \"What we like to say is, Thomas Edison invented a commercially practical light bulb.\"",
      "Wallace says the light bulb was just one component of Edison's achievement: \"He was inventing new dynamoes, cables, switches, sockets, meters. If you're gonna sell electricity, you gotta have a meter. So, it's a systems approach.\"",
      "On New Year's Eve 1879, Edison gave an unforgettable demo in Menlo Park, New Jersey. Wallace said, \"He lit up the grounds, he lit up the laboratory, he lit up an office building with about a hundred of these light bulbs, and invited the press: 'Come out to Menlo Park and see what we've done.' He especially invited his investors!",
      "\"When the lights come on, it's almost a mystical experience, because these are not candles, they're not gas lights, they don't hiss, they don't smoke, they don't create noxious odors. You turn it on, it just sits and it glows.\"",
      "Edison's portfolio also included motion pictures, Portland cement, and even a talking doll, \"which is one of his famous flops,\" said Wallace.",
      "Steven Johnson, who has written 14 books about innovation and also co-founded a new Google AI tool for research called NotebookLM, says there are two archetypes many people use that are almost always wrong: \"They are the kind of lone genius coming up with a brilliant idea, and having that idea in a moment of sudden inspiration,\" he said. \"That is almost never the case.",
      "\"Edison gave a lot of credit to the crew,\" Johnson said. \"He has a famous line where he's like, 'I'm not so much a generator of ideas as I am a sponge.'\"",
      "Edison called Menlo Park \"the invention factory.\" He employed engineers, chemists, glassblowers, and mathematicians. Johnson said, \"He came up with this idea that if you got these interesting people together and put them in the same room together, that you could create a kind of a factory for new ideas. And that's what Menlo Park became.\"",
      "The pioneering spirit",
      "Today, Americans come up with more inventions than ever. Over the years, hundreds of entrepreneurs have appeared on ABC's \"Shark Tank,\" where they pitch a panel of potential investors, including real estate mogul Barbara Corcoran, Kind Bar founder Daniel Lubetzky, fashion pioneer Daymond John, and venture capitalist Rashaun Williams.",
      "\"They think their idea is always terrific,\" said Corcoran. \"It very often isn't. Anybody could come up with an idea, and everybody has at least a dozen. Really, everybody's got an idea, But building a business? Not many people can do it.\"",
      "She says most people coming into \"Shark Tank\" appreciate that the hard part is still ahead. But Lubetzky responded, \"It's not necessarily bad that entrepreneurs don't know how hard it will be.\"",
      "\"I would've never done what I've done, never,\" said John.",
      "Asked what it is about America that fosters such ingenuity, John replied, \"I think the people that founded the country went against all odds to come here. So, we got the cream of the crop of the world.\"",
      "Lubetzky added, \"You see also the pioneering spirit of all the immigrants and all the people that tried things out, and bring that spirit of risk-taking.\"",
      "\"And they bring that spirit on,\" said John. \"And then you have the top people around the world who left for either famine, atrocities, whatever, they made it over here, and they had a goal to make it over here. So they, first if all, are 1% of where they're from.\"",
      "Williams said, \"I think we have to give this government a lot of credit, too. A lot of the original venture capital funds were funded by government entities.\"",
      "Lubetzky said America's financial ecosystem \"allows ideas to be financed. Venture capital is much, much less developed in most other countries.\"",
      "And, Williams said, \"We also glamorize the successful entrepreneur in this country, just like we glamorize the professional athlete or entertainer. If you start a company and you sell it for $1 billion and you scale it, you're on the cover of every magazine. You're a superstar in this country.\"",
      "And, as for failure, Lubetzky said, \"In most of the world, if you fail, it's a negative mark on your family. And you are, you know -- it's horrible. You're an outcast. In the United States, you shrug it off and you try again.\"",
      "Corcoran said, \"The real question is, what do the successful entrepreneurs have in common? And I say what they have in common is the ability to get back up, take rejection.\"",
      "\"A pretty powerful combination\"",
      "According to Google's Steven Johnson, history is periodically upended by huge, foundational, technological breakthroughs.",
      "\"Edison realized that for the light bulb to work, he had to build an electrical grid,\" he said. \"But it was the grid that really changed everything, because once you had power to your homes, yeah, you could turn on a light, but you could also build a dishwasher, and you could have a television, and you could have a radio.\"",
      "The personal computer launched another huge round of innovation, and then the internet, and now artificial intelligence. All of it \u2026 invented in America.",
      "Johnson said, \"Openness to new ideas, willingness for consumers to experiment, that mix of a capitalist model with venture capital, [plus] government support and academic support, you put all those things together, and it's a pretty powerful combination.\"",

    "story": [
      "Americans receive tens of millions of unsolicited automated calls and texts each day, often intended to dupe them into forking over personal information or money.",
      "That's the thrust of a new report by U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a consumer advocacy organization, which found that scam and telemarketing calls and texts have proliferated across the country, despite safeguards intended to prevent them. (Of the 9,242 phone companies that filed with the FCC as of Sept. 28, 2025, less than half have installed robocall-fighting software.)",
      "Nationwide, Americans received an average of 2.56 billion robocalls a month from January to September. That's up from 2.14 billion a month in 2024, and the highest level in six years, according to PIRG's analysis of data from YouMail, one of the largest robocall-blocking companies.",
      "Meanwhile, the volume of automated texts received by Americans has skyrocketed since 2021, when a government crackdown on robocalls led more telemarketers and scammers to shift to texts. Data from PIRG shows that the annual volume of robotexts received in 2024 was roughly 19 billion, nearly triple the approximately 7 billion robotexts received in 2021.",
      "The predatory messages are a daily nuisance for many. About one-third of Americans say they get at least one scam phone call a day, while one-fifth say they receive one scam text every day,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Pew Research Center.",
      "Types of scams",
      "Roboscams come in many forms, as detailed in PIRG's report. Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at PIRG, said they usually stem from crime rings or dedicated scam operations whose mission is to extract personal information or get some kind of financial information or actual payment from victims.",
      "\"The calls and texts are low cost and high reward,\" she said in an email. \"As long as some percentage keep working, the scammers will keep trying.\"",
      "Examples of some common scams include:",
      "Impersonating IRS, BanksDuring tax season, bad actors pose as IRS officials or tax preparation companies. Many scammers impersonate banks and credit card companies to steal account information. Another common trap are calls and texts that incite fear about unpaid loan balances or offer dubious debt relief opportunities.",
      "Package deliveryPackage delivery scams have become very common, with fraudsters posing as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx and UPS sending out messages that there was an issue with a delivery. Included in the text is a fake link, leading victims to pay money to ensure the fake package ends up in their hands.",
      "While some escape the scams unscathed, many don't. According to Pew, approximately a quarter of Americans say they've given up personal information to scammers as a result a predatory phone call, text message or email.",
      "How did the problem get so bad?",
      "Scams are growing more sophisticated and easier to set up, thanks to\u00a0artificial intelligence. According to PIRG, AI allows bots to send fraudulent texts to thousands of people at a time.",
      "\"The bad guys always seem to be several steps ahead of the regulators and phone companies,\" Murray said.",
      "Scammers have employed\u00a0AI voice-cloning tools\u00a0to trick people into thinking they are talking to a friend, family member or government official.",
      "Up until late 2023, robocalls had declined considerably, according to Alex Quilici, founder and CEO of YouMail, who is cited in the PIRG report. Over the last two years, however, the number of automated texts and calls has increased along with the cost of related scams for victims.",
      "The amount of money lost to phone scams rose\u00a016% from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, according to the Federal Trade Commission. On average, victims lost $3,690 to scam robocalls and $1,452 to scam texts in the first half of 2025, PIRG found.",
      "In 2019, Congress passed the TRACED Act, which directed the Federal Communications Commission to require phone companies to implement stricter technology to regulate robocalls, including caller ID authentication. To keep track of compliance, the FCC launched a\u00a0robocall mitigation database where companies are supposed to detail their efforts to fight illegal robocalls on their networks.",
      "But those efforts have been met with mixed success. As of Sept. 28, only 44% of phone companies have completely installed the mandated software and adopted anti-robocall policies, down from 47% in 2024, PIRG found.",
      "\"You'd think that \u2014 given that it's been more than 15 years since the first federal law to attack spam robocalls \u2014 we'd have seen more progress by now,\" the PIRG report authors write,\u00a0\"We still don't know whether to trust our caller ID and may worry we'll miss an important call if we don't answer.\""

      "The U.S. military flew three B-52 bombers on missions near the coast of Venezuela on Wednesday, according to a Global Strike Command spokesperson and a U.S. official, as the Trump administration continues to exert pressure on Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.",
      "Tracking data on the site Flightradar24 shows the planes circled in the Caribbean Sea on Wednesday, flying about 150 miles north of Venezuela. The data was first reported by ABC News.",
      "The B-52 is a long-range bomber capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, according to the Air Force. It was used extensively in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "The mission follows a monthslong uptick in military activity in the waters off Venezuela. President Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the area. In sum, about 10,000 U.S. forces are built up in the Caribbean region, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, CBS News learned Wednesday.",
      "The military has also carried out airstrikes on at least five alleged drug-carrying boats near Venezuela since last month. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he has authorized covert CIA operations in the South American country, and said his administration is considering strikes on drug traffickers by land.",
      "Tensions have spiked between the U.S. and Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of collaborating with cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua. Maduro was indicted in Manhattan for narco-terrorism five years ago, and the administration increased the bounty for his capture to $50 million earlier this year.",
      "Maduro has denied ties to drug cartels and lashed out at the Trump administration for its strikes on alleged drug boats, accusing it of plotting regime change. Mr. Trump has not publicly said he is seeking the ouster of Maduro, whose 2018 and 2024 election victories were marred by widespread allegations of fraud.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump did not say whether the CIA has authority to take out Maduro, telling CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer.\"",
      "The boat strikes have also drawn domestic pushback, with Democrats and some Republicans arguing that Mr. Trump needs congressional authority to carry out the strikes and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "The Trump administration has asserted that it does not need permission from Congress. It has argued that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it called \"unlawful combatants,\" in a notice to lawmakers obtained by CBS News."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California is introducing a resolution in the House calling for stricter standards of conduct for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, citing what he describes as \"lawless\" enforcement tactics during recent federal crackdowns.",
      "The resolution, cosponsored by Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton and Reps. Jonathan Jackson and Jasmine Crockett, urges the Department of Homeland Security to require ICE and CBP personnel to wear body cameras, display visible identification and stop wearing facial coverings except in cases of immediate safety threats. It also calls for transferring oversight of ICE to the Justice Department and creating independent civilian review boards to investigate enforcement actions.",
      "\"This is about respecting law enforcement as professionals, but having high professional standards,\" Khanna told CBS News. \"We should hold ICE officers to the same level of transparency and accountability we expect of police officers or FBI agents.\"",
      "The resolution, set to be introduced Friday, is unlikely to advance in the GOP-controlled lower chamber, where Republicans have strongly backed the Trump administration's immigrant enforcement operations and resisted new restrictions on federal agents. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer included roughly $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border security efforts, including $75 billion for ICE.",
      "Khanna's proposal follows weeks of heightened tension over Operation Midway Blitz, a Trump administration initiative that has led to more than 1,500 arrests across Illinois and neighboring states. Immigration operations have drawn scrutiny after reports of masked agents, unmarked vehicles and violent encounters involving civilians and journalists.",
      "On Tuesday, federal agents deployed tear gas during an attempted arrest on Chicago's Southeast Side, prompting clashes with residents and local police. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sara Ellis ordered immigration officers operating in the area to wear body cameras, saying she was \"a little startled\" after seeing reports of tear gas and force used against protesters. \"I live in Chicago,\" Ellis said. \"And I'm not blind.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson defended federal immigration officers earlier this week, saying he has \"not seen them cross the line yet.\" Johnson told reporters that \"ICE and the valiant, brave, patriotic Americans who step up to serve in these dangerous law enforcement positions deserve our respect and our support,\" adding that Republicans \"stand for law enforcement.\"",
      "Khanna's resolution references recent incidents in Chicago and similar tactics in Los Angeles and New York, warning that the use of masks and unmarked vehicles \"fuels impersonation of immigration officers\" and undermines public trust.

      "President Trump announced the strike Tuesday in a\u00a0post on Truth Social, saying the vessel had been \"just off the Coast of Venezuela\" and was \"transiting along a known designated terrorist organization\" route. Mr. Trump said intelligence confirmed that the boat was trafficking narcotics and referred to the men aboard as \"narcoterrorists,\" but offered no other information.",
      "This was the fifth such strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean. Figures released by the administration say 27 people have been killed in the strikes.",
      "The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service said it was \"aware of the reports\" that citizens of the country, which lies less than 10 miles off the coast Venezuela, had been on the vessel. Police said they are conducting inquiries, but said that the information \"is yet to be fully verified through official channels\" and said they could not confirm any details. The agency said a statement would be released once information was verified, and asked for \"patience and understanding\" amid \"this complex situation.\"",

    "summary": "A new scam involves fake letters that appear to be from U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts \u2014 but it's a ploy to trick seniors, agency warns.",
    "story": [
      "It looks official \u2014 a letter stamped with the U.S. Supreme Court seal, signed by Chief Justice John Roberts and Associate Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, warning that you're under investigation. But it's a scam \u2014 one designed to steal money from Social Security recipients, according to the agency's watchdog division.",
      "The fake SCOTUS letter prompted an Oct. 8 warning from the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General, cautioning the program's 75 million beneficiaries to be on alert if they receive a purported letter from the nation's highest court.",
      "While the warning didn't disclose how many Social Security recipients have been targeted by the fraud, the watchdog group said the hoax marks the evolution of government imposter scams, such as the decade-old scheme in which criminals\u00a0pretend to be IRS officials\u00a0informing their target victims that they're under investigation for tax fraud. The threat of an IRS probe has long been used by scammers to scare individuals into providing money or private data such as Social Security numbers.",
      "In this latest version of the same scheme, fraudsters are impersonating Supreme Court justices, rather than IRS officials. The new scam relies on multiple points of contact, with a fake letter followed by a text or call from the fraudsters, making it appear more authentic, said John Haraburda, Transaction Network Services (TNS) robocall data expert and director of product management.",
      "\"The fraudsters get very, very smart,\" Haraburda said. \"They do the mailing, then they'll send you a text from the number they're going to use for the phone call saying, 'This is the Social Security Administration \u2014 we're going to be calling you from this number in a few seconds.'\"",
      "He added, \"Then you've got this text message in a way authenticating the call that's coming in. That lets you break down your hesitation, to basically drop your guard.\"",
      "According to the Social Security Inspector General, the scam letter is personally addressed to the would-be victim, warning that they're a suspect in connection with legal proceedings and criminal charges. It also falsely claims their Social Security number has been compromised.",
      "The fake letter goes on to say that the Supreme Court has requested financial institutions to freeze the recipient's assets, and urges them to cooperate with \"the U.S. Treasury Department,\" the watchdog agency said.",
      "\"The letter ominously closes by stating, should the recipient encounter any difficulties in safeguarding assets, the recipient will bear full liability for any losses incurred following the suspension of their SSN,\" the SSA's inspector general said. \"Scammers most likely will follow up with text messages or telephone calls.\"",
      "Scammers may follow up with a text that includes a link to a fake Social Security site, which will capture the victim's login and password as they attempt to gain access to their accounts, or might ask for credit card info, Haraburda said.",
      "Never click on a link in an email or text that purports to be from an official, he noted. Instead, go directly to the Social Security site \u2014 https://www.ssa.gov \u2014 to log in.",
      "\"On every level, this letter is completely false,\" Michelle L. Anderson, acting inspector general at the Social Security Administration's Office of the Inspector General said in a statement. \"These criminals are falsely accusing an individual of a crime and using federal agencies and federal officials to try to scare and legitimize their scam \u2014 if you get this type of letter, rip it up and report it.\""

      "In a 50 to 44 vote, all but three Democrats voted against moving forward with the full-year Defense Department appropriations bill. Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania voted in favor of advancing the bill. It needed 60 votes to advance.",
      "The vote came as the Senate remained locked in a stalemate, with no movement despite repeated votes on a short-term funding measure to reopen the government. The push to move forward with the Pentagon funding bill marked a change in approach as the shutdown wore on.",
      "Since 60 votes are required to advance most legislation in the Senate, Republicans need support from across the aisle to reopen the government. And with 53 Republicans in the Senate, Democratic support was also needed to advance the full-year Pentagon funding bill. Democrats have continued to demand an extension of expiring health insurance tax credits in exchange for their support.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune railed against Democrats on the Senate floor after the vote fell short, saying\u2028Democrats \"just voted against the bill that would actually pay the troops.\"",
      "\"This is politics,\" Thune said. \"If anything was needed to demonstrate just how fundamentally uninterested Democrats are in supporting our troops and defending our country, just take a look at this vote.\"",
      "The South Dakota Republican said \"the Democrat Party is the party that will not take yes for an answer,\" citing the repeated failed vote on a temporary measure to fund the government, his assertions that he would guarantee a vote on Democrats' health care demands and the failed effort to advance the Pentagon funding bill.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated ahead of the vote Thursday that Democrats would oppose advancing the legislation. The New York Democrat told reporters at a news conference that \"it's always been unacceptable to Democrats to do the Defense bill without other bills that have so many things that are important to the American people, in terms of health care, in terms of housing, in terms of safety.\"",
      "Although Democrats have been at odds with Republicans over how to keep the government funded in the short term, they have generally been supportive of work on the regular appropriations process. But Schumer argued that \"we have always negotiated these appropriations agreements in a bipartisan way,\" and Republicans are now \"just going at it alone.\"",
      "Each year, Congress must pass legislation to fund the government. But the process has often stretched late into the fiscal year, forcing lawmakers to pass stopgap measures to keep the government funded while they continue work on the 12 full-year appropriations bills. In recent years, Congress has resorted to grouping the funding measures together into large packages, known as omnibus bills. Those are often considered at the last minute before a deadline, pressuring lawmakers to support them and fund the government. Still, GOP leadership in Congress has been pushing to return to the way the appropriations process is intended to play out, with individual funding bills.",
      "Thune encouraged Democrats earlier Thursday to allow the full-year Pentagon funding bill to advance, telling reporters that if Democrats \"want to stop the Defense bill, I don't think it's very good optics for them.\"",
      "\"They've got multiple opportunities to block it on the back end,\" Thune said. \"If I were them, I'd let us get on it, and then let's see if we can add.\"",
      "Thune said lawmakers wanted to add appropriations for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and Education, noting that a couple of other appropriations bills are available to wrap into a funding package as well. But doing so would require unanimous consent after a vote on advancing the measure. Schumer said \"they don't have it\" ahead of the vote.",
      "The Pentagon legislation would restore paychecks for members of the military. It comes as President Trump directed the department to \"use all available funds\" to avoid service members missing their mid-month paychecks on Oct. 15. Still, the move hasn't taken pressure off of lawmakers to reach a permanent solution, with Speaker Mike Johnson calling the administration's maneuver a \"temporary fix.\""

      "Created by NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, the latest outlook anticipates warmer-than-average temperatures for much of the contiguous U.S., although southern states will most likely experience a drier and warmer winter than usual. Conditions in northern states are expected to be cooler and wetter.",
      "Those weather patterns are consistent with the recent transition into\u00a0La Ni\u00f1a, the cooler phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle. ENSO is an alternating system of climate patterns determined by sea surface temperatures and precipitation levels across an area of the equatorial Pacific Ocean that depart from the neutral norm.",

      "Both La Ni\u00f1a and its opposite, El Ni\u00f1o, the cycle's \"warm phase,\" wield strong influence over weather conditions in North America. When La Ni\u00f1a is active, it typically brings drought to southern parts of the country and flooding rains to the Pacific Northwest and Canada, according to NOAA. During winter months, this phase of ENSO often leads to warmer and drier conditions in the South and cooler conditions across the North, which tend to accompany greater amounts of precipitation.",
      "Forecasters have said they expect La Ni\u00f1a to last through February 2026 before transitioning back to the neutral phase of the cycle as the spring season begins.",
      "NOAA's winter outlook does not offer snowfall predictions, but it does forecast above-normal overall precipitation between December and February for the Pacific Northwest and northern California along the West Coast, as well as the northern Rockies, Great Plains and western Great Lakes, all of which are consistent with the presence of La Ni\u00f1a.",
      "Also aligned with the phase's characteristic effects is the precipitation forecast for the southern half of the country, with NOAA predicting drier than normal conditions across the Southwest, southern Texas and the Southeast.",
      "Outside of the contiguous U.S., the outlook predicts warmer than usual winter months for northwestern Alaska and cooler than normal months for the state's panhandle, with above-average precipitation forecast for western parts of the state and below-average precipitation forecast for the panhandle area.

      "Washington \u2014 The U.S. government is probing the social media of those applying for legal immigration benefits as part of a Trump administration push to root out \"anti-American\" activity and views that are \"beyond the pale,\" a top immigration official told CBS News.",
      "Joseph Edlow, the director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency in charge of the legal immigration system, said the vetting effort primarily relies on what he called the \"social media screening\" of people applying for green cards and other immigration applications.",
      "In August, the Trump administration issued a directive instructing USCIS officials to consider the identification of \"anti-American\" views and activity of certain applicants for immigration benefits as an \"overwhelmingly negative factor\" that could justify denial.",
      "Asked what types of views and activities could be found to be \"anti-American\" by his agency, Edlow cited \"what we've seen college campuses to have allowed over the last several years.\"",
      "\"There has been such a large-scale espousing of foreign terrorist ideology, whether it's Hamas or another organization that has been matched with \u2026 a clear desire by these elements to trample on the rights of other people around them,\" Edlow told CBS News during an interview at USCIS headquarters in Maryland.",
      "Pressed on whether those determinations could be based on speech protected by the U.S. Constitution, Edlow said, \"Absolutely not.\"",
      "\"People are free to make whatever statements they want on social media or anywhere else. And anyone who, you know, doesn't support the same candidate that I support. That is not what we're talking about,\" he said.",
      "\"We are talking about beyond the pale,\" Edlow added. \"We are talking about people who are actively supporting the violent overthrow of this country, or otherwise are providing material support to terrorist organizations across the world.\"",
      "Edlow said the probe into \"anti-American\" views and activities would not be the sole criteria for granting or denying applications.",
      "\"It's not the deciding factor. It's not the only factor, but it is one factor that we want to make sure that we fully understand,\" he said.",
      "Critics of the Trump administration have accused it of weaponizing U.S. immigration law to punish noncitizens for their legally protected speech.",
      "Federal courts have questioned the legality of the administration's effort to deport legal residents like Mahmoud Khalil, an activist who participated in protests at Columbia University over the war in Gaza. The administration has claimed Khalil and other activists undermined U.S. foreign policy and fostered antisemitism. But those targeted and their allies have argued the government is simply penalizing them for exercising their First Amendment rights.",
      "Earlier this week, the State Department announced that officials had revoked the visas of several foreign nationals who it said \"celebrated\" the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "\"I don't want to be the DMV\"",
      "Unlike its sister agencies Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection, processing immigration benefits has long been the core function of USCIS.",
      "But under the second Trump administration, USCIS has placed a greater emphasis on combating immigration fraud, aggressively vetting applicants and working more closely with ICE, including to facilitate arrests at its offices across the country. This summer, the agency also announced it would hire and train its own team of armed special agents, who Edlow said are not yet on the job.",
      "The citizenship process alone has been tweaked several times by the Trump administration, which has added more questions to the civics test used to quiz applicants on U.S. history and politics, and expanded inquiries into whether applicants have \"good moral character.\"",
      "It has also restarted a long-dormant practice, known as \"neighborhood checks,\" which involves sending investigators to interview the neighbors and coworkers of citizenship applicants. Edlow said those checks will not apply to every case due to resource constraints.",
      "Immigrant advocates argue the changes are unfairly scaring legal immigrants. But Edlow said USCIS is \"moving back to where it was supposed to be at the beginning,\" arguing that it had effectively become \"a rubber-stamping agency\" under the Biden administration. He said vetting has always been a core function of USCIS since its creation after the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",
      "\"We are not here as a police force,\" he said. \"We are going to be here with our agents investigating large scale fraud patterns that right now create much confusion and many problems within the legal immigration system.\"",
      "Edlow argued the effort would ultimately make it easier for people to immigrate to the U.S. legally.",
      "\"I don't want to be the DMV \u2026 of this government,\" Edlow added. \"We want to be faster. We want to be leaner.\"",
      "No decision yet on DACA's future",
      "One of the most well-known programs administered by USCIS is the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, which currently protects half a million so-called \"Dreamers\" from deportation and allows them to work in the U.S. legally. They are immigrants who, as children, entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed their visas.",
      "The first Trump administration tried to terminate DACA, arguing it was illegal. But the Supreme Court blocked the effort on technical grounds.",
      "Asked whether the second Trump administration will try to end DACA again, Edlow suggested a final decision had not been made.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration will continue paying FBI agents despite the ongoing government shutdown that has frozen paychecks for nearly all federal workers, FBI Director Kash Patel announced Wednesday.",
      "\"You've found a way to get these individuals paid during a government shutdown,\" Patel said to President Trump during an unrelated Oval Office event. \"On behalf of the FBI, it's a great debt that we owe you.\"",
      "Patel did not specify the source of the funds that would be used to pay the agents.",
      "The announcement follows recent moves by the administration to ensure members of the military receive paychecks this week despite most federal workers going without pay until the government reopens.",
      "\"We got the people that we want paid, paid,\" Mr. Trump told CBS News senior White House reporter Jennifer Jacobs. \"We want the FBI paid and we want the military paid.\"",
      "Military service members were set to be paid Wednesday after Mr. Trump issued a memo directing the Pentagon to use other unspent funds to make payroll. Around $8 billion in funds from the previous fiscal year had been identified to cover the mid-month paychecks, a Pentagon official said earlier. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem also said the Coast Guard, which falls under the purview of her department, would receive paychecks this week from funds in the \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" that passed earlier this year.",
      "When funding lapsed on Oct. 1, agencies began implementing shutdown procedures to send hundreds of thousands of workers home on furlough. While essential employees and those whose duties are funded through other means stayed on the job, almost no federal workers had been expected to be paid until Congress reopens the government. Workers are expected to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "Under the Justice Department's shutdown plans, no FBI agents were placed on furlough, and only about 10% of department employees overall were expected to be sent home.",
      "The FBI Agents Association thanked Mr. Trump for ensuring agents are paid, but noted that the FBI's workforce also includes people other than agents, including analysts and professional staff. The group called for Congress to reopen the government.",
      "\"If the shutdown continues, the Bureau will be forced to curtail travel, training, hiring, and other vital operations, slowing investigations and weakening coordination with law enforcement partners,\" the group said in a statement.",
      "The administration's moves to pay certain federal workers has prompted questions about its legal authority to do so, since Congress appropriates funds and gives agencies a limited scope for what they can be used for. In previous shutdowns, Congress has voted on stand-alone measures to pay the military. And the Oct. 15 deadline for military paychecks had been widely viewed as a possible off-ramp in the shutdown amid an impasse between the parties that has extended into a third week. But the moves to unilaterally fund the mid-month paychecks took the pressure off lawmakers, at least temporarily.",
      "Republican leaders in Congress tried to resume that pressure on Democrats to reopen the government and pay the military Wednesday. House Speaker Mike Johnson warned that members of the military are in danger of missing their next paycheck later this month if the shutdown continues, calling the administration's move to pay service members a \"temporary fix.\"",
      "Johnson, asked about funds for law enforcement, said he spoke with Mr. Trump and OMB Director Russ Vought at the White House on Tuesday. He said \"they're having to triage federal spending,\" and must determine \"what are the most essential services, personnel, policies and what are not.\"",
      "\"When we look at that, we prioritize troops and law enforcement,\" Johnson said.",
      "Separately, the Trump administration has sought to lay off thousands of federal employees during the shutdown, drawing\u00a0pushback from some Republican lawmakers and prompting a court ruling on Wednesday\u00a0temporarily halting the firings. Mr. Trump said his administration is \"terminating tremendous numbers of Democrat projects.\"",
      "\"We're getting rid of a lot of things that we never wanted because of the fact that they made this stupid move,\" the president told reporters."

    "summary": "Advocacy group The Trevor Projected released data from the first year of a study following more than 1,600 LGBTQ+ youth across the country.",
    "story": [
      "Mental health distress among LGBTQ+ youth in the United States has been increasing amid a surge in anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, but strong support networks and access to health care were shown to ease symptoms for some, a study found.",
      "The findings were published Thursday by The Trevor Project, an LGBTQ+ advocacy organization that provides crisis intervention and suicide prevention services. Researchers followed 1,689 LGBTQ+ young people between the ages of 13 and 24 between September 2023 and March 2025.",
      "The study is the first to follow a sample of LGBTQ+ young people over an extended period of time, said Ronita Nath, vice president of research for The Trevor Project.",
      "\"We know that LGBTQ+ youth are at a significantly higher suicide risk than their cisgender heterosexual peers, but most research only captures their experiences at one point in time, which really limits our understanding of how risk and protective factors play out over months or years,\" Nath told CBS News.",
      "The participants of the study were asked to complete a 139 question survey about a range of risk and protective factors on three separate occasions between six month intervals.",
      "Researchers found mental health distress increased substantially throughout the study's first year. LGBTQ+ youth reporting recent anxiety symptoms rose from 57% to 68%. Those reporting depressive symptoms climbed from 48% to 54%. Suicidal ideation among LGBTQ+ youth grew from 41% to 47%, the data shows.",
      "The findings show how experiencing discrimination or support preceded changes in mental health, suggesting they drive rather than coincide with negative or positive health outcomes, Nath said.",
      "Trevor Project data shows living in an LGBTQ+-affirming home was linked to 37% lower odds of suicidal thoughts. Receiving high support from family was associated with 62% lower odds of suicidal ideation when controlled for age, sexual orientation, gender identity and race/ethnicity.",
      "Data also indicates conversion therapy, or attempts to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity, remains a harmful experience for LGBTQ+ youth contributing to mental health distress.",
      "\"While we may think it's a relic of the past, this data indicates that these dangerous practices are still happening and actually may be on the rise,\" Nath said.",
      "Reports of being threatened with conversion therapy doubled in the first year of the study, and exposure to the practice rose from 9% to 15% among participants.",
      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case challenging a Colorado law banning conversion therapy treatments for minors. Colorado is one of at least 20 states that prohibit mental health professionals from engaging in any practice, including talk therapy, that attempts to change an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.",
      "Transgender and nonbinary youth between ages 13 and 17 reported the poorest mental health outcomes. They were twice as likely to report anxiety and suicidal ideation compared to their cisgender peers, a pattern that persisted over the course of the study.",
      "Legislation restricting legal and medical protections for transgender and nonbinary youth may be contributing to the worsening outcomes, Nath said.",
      "\"Access to medical, legal, and social supports for gender transition, which includes hormones, puberty blockers, accurate identification documents contributed to improved mental health among transgender and nonbinary youth, which I think highlights the potential harm created by legislation reducing access to transgender health care,\" she said.",
      "The ACLU is tracking at least 25 laws passed across the U.S. to limit access to affirming health care for trans youth.",
      "While mental health outcomes worsened, suicide attempts among the LGBTQ+ youth surveyed declined from 11% to 7%. Still, that rate remains higher than national estimates for cisgender heterosexual youth.",
      "\"LGBTQ+ young people are not inherently prone to higher suicide risk, but that, they're placed at higher suicide risk because of how they're stigmatized and denied support,\" said Nath.",
      "Nath emphasized the overarching takeaway from the study is how support from family and community can affect the mental health of LGBTQ+ youth.",
      "\"Across all our analysis, supportive family environments, accepting friends, and greater cumulative family support actions all reduce the likelihood of later anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, which really does echo decades of research on the protective power of family acceptance,\" she said.",
      "If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can connect to a crisis counselor at The Trevor Project by texting \"START\" to 678-678 or calling 1-866-488-7386.",
      "For more information about mental health care resources and support, The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) HelpLine can be reached Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m. ET, at 1-800-950-NAMI (6264) or email info@nami.org."

      "Lead has a history of finding its way into the nation's cinnamon supply, with several factors playing a role, according to Brian Ronholm, director of food policy at Consumer Reports.",
      "\"Cinnamon comes from the inner bark of several tree species and can absorb lead from the soil in which it's grown, and the soil can be contaminated with lead from industrial byproducts,\" he explained. \"Lead can also enter cinnamon from processing equipment, storage containers or packaging.\"",
      "To protect against contamination, the FDA monitors and regulates lead levels in foods. In 2023, the agency launched an investigation to find the source of tainted cinnamon in applesauce pouches that caused hundreds of children to get lead poisoning. The products, which were eventually recalled, were sold by brands WanaBana, Weis and Schnucks.",
      "In a separate move last year, the FDA issued three alerts identifying ground cinnamon products with elevated levels of lead. The agency launched a third alert in August 2024, which it continues to update.",
      "\"Overall, it's troubling that these elevated lead levels continue to be found in cinnamon,\" Ronholm said. \"It's also reassuring that the FDA is continuing to scrutinize these products given all of the budget and staffing uncertainty they are experiencing.\"",
      "The FDA in March announced\u00a0plans to cut 3,500 employees, although some dismissals\u00a0have since been reversed.",
      "Thousands of FDA-regulated products, ranging from food to drugs to cosmetics, are recalled each year in an effort to protect the public from potential harm.",
      "Lead's impact on health",
      "According to the FDA, there is no known safe level of contact with lead. The agency says that continued exposure to elevated levels of lead for months or longer can lead to a range of adverse health effects, particularly in young children.",
      "\"High levels of exposure to lead in utero, infancy and early childhood can lead to neurological effects such as learning disabilities, behavior difficulties and lowered IQ,\" the FDA states in its most recent alert.",
      "Lead can also cause long-term health problems in adults, according to the World Health Organization, including increased risk of high blood pressure, cardiovascular problems and kidney damage."

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A scientist laid off by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said \"the everyday American should be very concerned\" by reductions in force amid the government shutdown.",
      "The scientist, one of hundreds of CDC employees terminated by the Trump administration last week, asked that her identity be concealed for fear of retribution.",
      "\"It's going to mean more deaths, more preventable deaths,\" she told CBS News on Wednesday of the layoffs. \"People will absolutely die from the impact of this administration.\"",
      "The scientist worked at the CDC for the past decade, studying chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease.",
      "She spoke out the same day a federal judge in Northern California issued a verbal order temporarily halting all the government layoffs that were issued since the shutdown began. This was in response to a lawsuit brought by federal employees' unions.",
      "\"They went in and fired entire programs, even statutorily mandated by law programs, they cut entirely,\" she said. \"So there is no staff to do this work anymore.\"",
      "She said everything she was working on has come to a complete stop.",
      "\"It's truly like an episode of 'Squid Games,' because we don't know what's going to happen next,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration has used the government shutdown, now in its third week, to lay off more than 4,000 federal workers, and plans to go further, according to Russell Vought, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget.",
      "\"I think we'll probably end up being north of 10,000,\" Vought said Wednesday during an appearance on \"The Charlie Kirk Show.\"",
      "Since last week, the Trump administration has informed approximately 600 CDC employees they have been laid off.",
      "On Tuesday, internal CDC officials not authorized to speak to the media told CBS News that on Oct. 10, about 1,000 CDC employees were initially given reduction-in-force notices, a government term for layoffs.",
      "However, within about 24 hours, hundreds of those notices were rescinded, reducing the total number of layoffs in the agency since Oct. 10 to about 600, the officials said.",
      "The judge's ruling Wednesday would put the layoffs of those 600 employees on hold, leaving them in limbo while the case plays out.",
      "According to numbers provided by a congressional source familiar with the cuts, the 600 CDC layoffs impacted all staff in the CDC's offices in Washington, D.C., all staff for the office of the director for the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, all staff for the National Center for State, Tribal, Local, and Territorial Public Health Infrastructure and Workforce, and all policy and communications staff for the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.",
      "The CDC agencies that saw their layoffs rescinded, according to the source, were the Immunization and Respiratory Diseases Center, the Global Health Center, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report team, the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and scientists working on responses to outbreaks of measles in the U.S. and Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "So far this year, the CDC has lost about 3,000 employees to resignations and layoffs, or just under a quarter of its staff, according to AFGE Local 2883, the union that represents CDC employees. That number was confirmed by the CDC officials who spoke to CBS News.",
      "The CDC has been beset by changes since Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took the reins of the Department of Health and Human Services earlier this year. A vaccine skeptic, Kennedy controversially replaced all 17 members of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel that makes vaccine recommendations.",
      "And in August, less than a month after being confirmed by the Senate as CDC director, Susan Monarez was fired from her post over what she said was pressure from Kennedy to rubber-stamp his vaccine directives, later testifying before the Senate that Kennedy's demands were \"inconsistent with my oath of office and the ethics required of a public official.\" Her firing also prompted several top CDC officials to resign in protest.",
      "Kennedy, in his own Senate testimony last month, denied that he pressured Monarez to preapprove vaccination recommendations. He told senators that when he asked Monarez if she was \"a trustworthy person,\" she responded, \"no.\"",
      "The congressional source also confirmed that among the permanent layoffs in HHS last week were 41 people in the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, an agency under the U.S. Public Health Service whose staff works in biodefense, as well as monitors data on natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and cyberattacks on hospitals.",
      "An HHS spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that the department's layoffs are part of an effort to cut a \"bloated bureaucracy,\" and that the positions were deemed \"non-essential by their respective divisions.\"",
      "\"HHS continues to close wasteful and duplicative entities, including those that are at odds with the Trump administration's Make America Healthy Again agenda,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "But the scientist who spoke to CBS News said the turmoil inside the CDC will impact responses to disease outbreaks, like the measles outbreak in South Carolina, where five new cases were reported Tuesday, bringing the total to 16 since July, and forcing 139 students into quarantine, according to health officials.",
      "\"The surge capacity of the CDC is going to be significantly hampered with these cuts,\" the scientist told CBS News. \"It's going to impede our ability to respond to public health outbreaks, just when all of these threats are on the rise.\""

    "summary": "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems.",
    "story": [
      "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency on Wednesday issued a sweeping emergency order directing all federal agencies to immediately patch critical vulnerabilities in certain devices and software made by F5, a technology vendor, after confirming a nation-state cyber actor gained unauthorized access to F5's source code.",
      "CISA \u2014 a part of the Department of Homeland Security that manages risks to the U.S.'s cyber and physical infrastructure \u2014 issued\u00a0Emergency Directive 26-01\u00a0following the company's disclosure that a foreign threat actor had maintained long-term, persistent access to its internal development and engineering environments using source code.",
      "Officials warned that attackers could exploit the vulnerabilities to steal credentials, move laterally through networks, and potentially take full control of targeted systems. F5 said it first discovered the attack in August but did not disclose exactly when it began.",
      "\"This directive addresses an imminent risk,\" Nick Anderson, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a news briefing Wednesday. \"A nation-state actor could exploit these flaws to gain unauthorized access to embedded credentials and API keys. That's an unacceptable risk to federal networks.\"",
      "F5 is a publicly traded American technology company headquartered in Seattle, Washington.",
      "Justice Department delayed breach announcement",
      "Earlier Wednesday, F5 disclosed the breach in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.",
      "In the SEC 8-K report, F5 said the Justice Department on Sept. 12 \"determined that a delay in public disclosure was warranted.\" It's one of the first times a company has publicly acknowledged DOJ intervention under the SEC's\u00a0cybersecurity disclosure rules.",
      "The rules were adopted in July 2023 and require companies to report cybersecurity incidents within four business days of determining that a material event has occurred.",
      "\"Under item 1.05(c), the Department may grant a delay after finding that a disclosure required by Item 1.05 would pose a substantial risk to national security or public safety,\" a Department of Justice spokesperson told CBS News in a statement.",
      "F5 CEO Fran\u00e7ois Locoh-Donou signed the filing, which said the company learned of the attack on Aug. 9 and launched an investigation alongside cybersecurity firms CrowdStrike, Mandiant and others, with assistance from federal law enforcement and unnamed \"government partners.\"",
      "\"During the course of its investigation, the Company determined that the threat actor maintained long-term, persistent access to certain F5 systems, including the BIG-IP product development environment and engineering knowledge management platform,\" F5 wrote in its filing.",
      "What's in the CISA emergency order",
      "CISA's order directed federal civilian executive branch agencies \u2014 which include the Department of Justice, Department of State, Department of the Treasury and the Federal Trade Commission, among others \u2014 to inventory F5 BIG-IP products, which are application delivery and security services.",
      "The federal agencies need to evaluate if their networks are accessible from the public internet, and apply newly released updates from F5 by Oct. 22, the emergency order stated. They must also complete scoping reports identifying affected devices by Oct. 29.",
      "There are currently thousands of F5 devices in use across federal networks, Anderson told CBS News. The cybersecurity agency said it expects to know more about the scope of exposure by the end of the month.",
      "CISA Acting Director Madhu Gottumukkala said in a statement that the agency remains \"steadfast\" in its mission to defend U.S. networks, even amid the ongoing government shutdown and the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015.",
      "\"The alarming ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited demands immediate and decisive action,\" Gottumukkala said. \"These same risks extend beyond federal systems \u2014 to any organization using this technology.\"",
      "No confirmed compromises yet, but broader campaign underway",
      "Anderson confirmed that CISA is not aware of any current data breaches within federal agencies, though the directive is designed to uncover any potential compromises. He said the campaign appears to be part of a broader nation-state effort targeting elements of the U.S. technology supply chain, not just one vendor.",
      "\"The broader goal here is persistent access \u2014 to gather intelligence, hold infrastructure hostage, or position themselves for future attacks,\" Anderson told CBS News during Wednesday's briefing.",
      "CISA declined to name the country behind the attack, citing ongoing investigations.",
      "\"The U.S. government is not making a public attribution at this time,\" said Marcy McCarthy, CISA's director of public affairs.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the head of threat intelligence for Unit 42, a team of cybersecurity experts and researchers at Palo Alto Networks, said the theft of F5 BIG-IP source code is \"significant, as it potentially facilitates rapid exploitation of vulnerabilities.\"",
      "\"Generally, if an attacker steals source code, it takes time to find exploitable issues,\" Unit 42 Chief Technology Officer Michael Sikorski said. \"In this case, they also stole information on undisclosed vulnerabilities that F5 was actively working to patch. This provides the ability for threat actors to exploit vulnerabilities that have no public patch, potentially increasing speed to exploit creation.\"",
      "Working through the government shutdown",
      "Pressed on the government's ability to respond amid furloughs and staffing reductions at CISA, Anderson acknowledged the agency's challenges but said it remains operational.",
      "\"We're sustaining essential functions and providing timely guidance like this to mitigate risk,\" he said. \"This is core mission work for CISA \u2014 exactly what we should be doing.\"",
      "Anderson also said the lapse of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, a law that had governed federal-private sector cyber information sharing before sunsetting, did not delay coordination with F5 or impact the agency's response.",
      "While the directive applies only to federal agencies, CISA is strongly urging state, local and private sector organizations using F5 technologies to follow the same patching and mitigation steps. F5's products, including its BIG-IP line, are widely used in both government and commercial networks to manage internet traffic and security."

    "story": [
      "The first woman to be elected governor of Maine is set to try and accomplish what no candidate in her state has managed in more than 30 years: to defeat Republican Susan Collins.",
      "But to even have the chance to do so, Democrat Janet Mills will first have to make it through what is already primed to be a contentious Senate primary between establishment voices and progressives at a crucial time in her party.",
      "Mills announced on Tuesday that she will run in Maine's 2026 Senate contest, offering Democrats one route to try to unseat the longtime GOP incumbent Collins and thin out the Republican Senate majority in Washington.",
      "\"I won't sit idly by while Maine people suffer and politicians like Susan Collins bend the knee as if this were normal,\" Mills said in an announcement video posted early Tuesday. \"My life's work has prepared me for this fight, and I'm ready to win. This election will be a simple choice: Is Maine going to bow down or stand up? I know my answer.\"",
      "CBS News reported last week\u00a0that Mills was expected to launch her campaign on Tuesday.",
      "The 77-year-old governor has been viewed as a key recruiting target for national Democrats, who face long odds of flipping control of the Senate back next year given a difficult map of races. Mills was first elected governor after winning by more than seven points in 2018, and she won reelection by a 13-point margin four years later.",
      "But recent political history, both locally and across the country, may upend expectations about how Mills will fare in what could become one of the tensest contests of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Collins has served as one of Maine's senators since 1997, establishing herself as a key moderate Republican voice, albeit one who tends to frustrate members of both major parties at times. During the 2020 presidential election, defeating Collins was a major, and well-funded, priority for Democrats. But Collins still managed to win re-election by more than eight points, even as Democrat Joe Biden's statewide margin over President Trump in Maine was nine points.",
      "The 72-year-old Collins has never lost a Senate race in Maine, her last defeat coming in a run for governor back in 1994.",
      "Mills' expected entry into the Senate race is already being met with some dismissiveness on the progressive side. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is an independent but caucuses with Democrats, is rallying around Graham Platner, a younger first-time statewide candidate who is already in the Senate race and, according to his online campaign bio, is a military veteran and oyster farmer.",
      "\"Graham Platner is a great working class candidate for Senate in Maine who will defeat Susan Collins,\" Sanders said recently on social media. \"It's disappointing that some Democratic leaders are urging Governor Mills to run. We need to focus on winning that seat & not waste millions on an unnecessary & divisive primary.\"",
      "In the fallout from a difficult 2024 election cycle where Democrats lost the presidency and Senate, and failed to retake control of the House, there have been persistent questions about how the party can recover. One tension rippling through the party is the subject of generational change, and whether to eschew the older candidates closer in age to Biden, 82, and instead nominate people who can try to revive a Democratic brand that has suffered in recent years.",
      "With Mills' entry into the race on Tuesday, Democrats in Maine may be on a collision course over those national concerns already rippling through other contests where the party's future direction could be at stake."

      "Former federal ethics officials who served in Republican and Democratic administrations are asking the Justice Department's inspector general to investigate the prosecutions of former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, ethics officials who worked in the Obama and George W. Bush administrations urged a formal review of interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia Lindsey Halligan's decision to prosecute Comey and James.",
      "They sent their request Tuesday to Acting Justice Department Inspector General William Blier, writing, \"Ms. Halligan pursued these indictments to fulfill President Donald J. Trump's longstanding personal vendetta against Mr. Comey and Ms. James, we are facing a turning point in our democracy and some of the most egregious examples of vindictive and meritless prosecution that our nation has ever seen.\"",
      "The letter was written by leaders of the Democracy Defenders Fund, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that has frequently been critical of the Trump administration.",
      "The group is led by Norm Eisen, former ethics official for President Barack Obama; Richard Painter, a former associate counsel to President George W. Bush; and Virginia Canter, a former White House associate counsel to Presidents Bill Clinton and Obama.",
      "Their letter also said, \"A president should never order prosecutions of his enemies. That happens in Putin's Russia, and it has happened in other dictatorships, but not here\u2013until now.\"",
      "Comey and Mr. Trump have had a contentious relationship for years. Comey, who was FBI director when Mr. Trump took office in 2017, was fired later that year by the president. Initially, the White House indicated he had been ousted over his handling of the investigation of Hillary Clinton's email server, but the president later told NBC News' Lester Holt that he had the FBI's Russia investigation on his mind and had terminated Comey because of \"this Russia thing with Trump and Russia.\"",
      "That firing ultimately set into motion special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into allegations that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and that the Trump campaign coordinated with the Kremlin. Mr. Trump has repeatedly denounced those allegations as a \"hoax.\" Mueller's probe found that Russia interfered in the election and several Trump campaign officials had contacts with Russians, but did not establish that campaign staff illegally conspired with the Russian government.",
      "For his part, Comey has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump since his firing, calling him \"morally unfit\" to be president in a 2018 interview.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund also contended that \"prosecutors should never be fired for refusing to bring charges they conclude are unfounded, even if the president orders them to do so. Yet that appears to be just what President Trump has done in order to charge Mr. Comey and Ms. James.\"",
      "The criminal cases were filed against Comey and James less than three weeks after President Trump called for their prosecution in a post on social media.",
      "The acting U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, who had been appointed to the position by Mr. Trump, resigned after he did not bring prosecutions of Comey and James, and the president announced he had been fired. A Trump White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, was then installed as acting U.S. attorney and within days secured grand jury indictments against Comey and James \u2014 with prosecutors charging Comey less than a week before the statute of limitations ran out.",
      "Halligan has defended both of the prosecutions. In the hours after James's indictment last week, Halligan said in a statement, \"No one is above the law. The charges as alleged in this case represent intentional, criminal acts and tremendous breaches of the public's trust.\"",
      "After charging Comey, Halligan said, \"The charges as alleged in this case represent a breach of the public trust at an extraordinary level,\"",
      "Comey is charged with making a false statement and obstruction of Congress, for allegedly lying to the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2020 when he denied that he had authorized someone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports. Comey has denied any wrongdoing.",
      "During an arraignment proceeding last week, Comey's defense attorney told a judge that Comey would seek a dismissal of the case next week, arguing the case is an unlawful vindictive prosecution against one of the president's critics.",
      "The Democracy Defenders Fund's request for a federal review of Halligan's cases also argued, \"The same pattern has now been repeated a second time in as many weeks with respect to another victim of President Trump's wrath. Ms. Halligan's prosecution of Letitia James on two counts of 'bank fraud' and a 'false statement' appears to be a further attempt to fulfill President Trump's personal vendetta against his political enemies.\"",
      "\"Trump's animus against Ms. James stems from having successfully brought a years-long civil fraud case against the Trump Organization, which included judgments against President Trump and two of his sons and imposed a court monitor with limits on their ability to conduct business in New York,\" the fund's letter continued.",
      "James is scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 24, to answer to charges of mortgage fraud and false statement in connection with a Norfolk, Virginia, home in 2020. James has also denied wrongdoing.",
      "The Office of the Justice Department Inspector General is on furlough because of the shutdown and did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment."

      "The B-52 is a long-range bomber capable of carrying conventional or nuclear weapons, according to the Air Force. It was used extensively in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
      "The mission follows a monthslong uptick in military activity in the waters off Venezuela. President Trump has deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the area. In sum, about 10,000 U.S. forces are built up in the Caribbean region, either on ships or in Puerto Rico, CBS News learned Wednesday.",
      "The military has also carried out airstrikes on at least five alleged drug-carrying boats near Venezuela since last month. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he has authorized covert CIA operations in the South American country, and said his administration is considering strikes on drug traffickers by land.",
      "Tensions have spiked between the U.S. and Maduro, whom the Trump administration has accused of collaborating with cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua. Maduro was indicted in Manhattan for narco-terrorism five years ago, and the administration increased the bounty for his capture to $50 million earlier this year.",
      "Maduro has denied ties to drug cartels and lashed out at the Trump administration for its strikes on alleged drug boats, accusing it of plotting regime change. Mr. Trump has not publicly said he is seeking the ouster of Maduro, whose 2018 and 2024 election victories were marred by widespread allegations of fraud.",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump did not say whether the CIA has authority to take out Maduro, telling CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer.\"",
      "The boat strikes have also drawn domestic pushback, with Democrats and some Republicans arguing that Mr. Trump needs congressional authority to carry out the strikes and hasn't provided enough evidence that the boats were carrying drugs.",
      "The Trump administration has asserted that it does not need permission from Congress. It has argued that the U.S. is in a \"non-international armed conflict\" with drug cartels, which it called \"unlawful combatants,\" in a notice to lawmakers obtained by CBS News."

      "Washington \u2014 Senate Majority Leader John Thune said Thursday he plans to move ahead with a bill to impose sanctions on Russia that has overwhelming bipartisan support, saying the \"time has come.\"",
      "\"I think we need to move,\" the South Dakota Republican said at the Capitol, shortly after President Trump shared that he was on a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Mr. Trump said after the call that he and Putin agreed to meet in Budapest, Hungary, in the near future. The call with Putin came a day before Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is scheduled to visit the White House.",
      "Thune said he did not want to commit to a hard deadline on the Senate taking up the sanctions bill, but told reporters it would be \"soon.\" When asked to define \"soon,\" he added, \"next 30 days.\"",
      "The House remains out of session during the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "Senators have been pushing for months for a vote on the legislation that would impose fresh economic sanctions to dial up the pressure on Russia to end its war in Ukraine. It gained momentum in late May and early June as Mr. Trump\u00a0appeared increasingly frustrated with Putin after Russia escalated attacks against Ukraine amid stalled peace negotiations.",
      "But the U.S. involvement in the war between Israel and Iran put the measure on the backburner in late June as it appeared to be nearing a vote. The White House also wanted changes to the measure to give the president more flexibility in imposing the sanctions.",
      "The sanctions bill was put on hold again when Mr. Trump threatened on July 14 to impose tariffs on countries that do business with Russia if it did not agree to a ceasefire.",
      "It received renewed interest in September when Russian drones entered Poland's airspace during an attack on Ukraine, weeks after Mr. Trump met with Putin in Alaska. But lawmakers held off on a vote because it had not received the green light from Mr. Trump, which lawmakers say they were waiting for to move ahead.",
      "The bill was introduced by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in April and has the support of 84 other senators, all but guaranteeing its passage in the Senate. A companion bill in the House has the support of more than 100 members.",
      "Thune said Thursday he has met with Graham about the bill and lawmakers have been trying to address technical issues, including how the bill would be implemented \u2014 details that had concerned the White House.",
      "\"I think the time is right,\" Thune said. \"I'm hoping we can get it scheduled.\"",
      "Thune said Graham will be filing an updated version of the bill, but did not detail how it would be different from the current version. Thune added that it would be \"the same basic premise.\"",
      "The measure includes a 500% tariff on imported goods from countries that buy Russian oil, gas and uranium. Senators previously said it was modified to allow the president to waive the sanctions for national security reasons.",
      "\"It's not unbridled or unconstrained authority simply to waive the sanctions,\" Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, a cosponsor of the bill, said earlier this year. Blumenthal described the sanctions as \"scorching\" and \"bone-crushing.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has also backed sanctions, saying that Putin has been unwilling to talk seriously about ending its war.",
      "\"I think we have to send him a message,\" Johnson said this summer."

Mr. Trump said intelligence confirmed that the boat was trafficking narcotics and referred to the men aboard as \"narcoterrorists,\" but offered no other information.",
      "This was the fifth such strike on an alleged drug vessel in the Caribbean. Figures released by the administration say 27 people have been killed in the strikes.",
      "The Trinidad and Tobago Police Service said it was \"aware of the reports\" that citizens of the country, which lies less than 10 miles off the coast Venezuela, had been on the vessel. Police said they are conducting inquiries, but said that the information \"is yet to be fully verified through official channels\" and said they could not confirm any details. The agency said a statement would be released once information was verified, and asked for \"patience and understanding\" amid \"this complex situation.\"",

But, so far, he has been thwarted, sometimes blaming both sides but now increasingly directing his frustration at Putin as the Russian president continues to resist pressure to hold direct talks with Zelenskyy.",
      "After previously blaming Zelenskyy for the war, Mr. Trump has talked about slapping new sanctions on Russia, calling it the \"aggressor\" \u2014 although he has so far stopped short of adding to the direct U.S. sanctions imposed by his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.",

    "summary": "More than 3,000 U.K. claimants accuse U.S. pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson of knowingly selling asbestos-tainted talcum powder, making them ill.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Thousands of people in the United Kingdom have filed a joint legal claim estimated to be worth more than \u00a31 billion ($1.34 billion) against Johnson & Johnson, accusing the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of selling baby powder that it knew was contaminated with carcinogenic asbestos.",
      "The claim involves more than 3,000 people who developed various forms of cancer and other diseases and is based on internal Johnson & Johnson memos and scientific reports.",
      "The company has long fought thousands of similar cases in the United States, and despite winning some appeals, in June last year it agreed to pay $700 million in a nationwide settlement to resolve allegations that it misled customers about the safety of its talcum-based powder products in its marketing.",
      "Just last week, a Los Angeles jury ordered the firm to pay $966 million to the family of a woman who died from a form of cancer after using J&J products.",
      "The U.K. lawsuit, which covers the years 1965 to 2023, claims that Johnson & Johnson, \"knew their talc products contained carcinogenic fibres, including asbestos, for more than fifty years and chose to keep it on the market in pursuit of profit.\"",
      "Despite the alleged knowledge of the carcinogens in its products, the firm only took its talcum powder products off shelves in Britain in 2023, the suit alleges, when it switched to a cornstarch based product \u2014 three years after doing so in Canada and the U.S.",
      "\"For decades Johnson & Johnson have orchestrated a campaign of denials and subterfuge,\" said the claimants' lead lawyer, Tom Longstaff of KP Law, which has brought the case against J&J and Kenvue Ltd., which was spun off two years ago, before the U.K. High Court. \"The facts are clear, contaminated talc contains carcinogenic material and Johnson & Johnson knew the risk to consumers.\"",
      "\"The scale of Johnson & Johnson's corporate wrongdoing is extraordinary, and we will be relentless in holding them to account on behalf of all those who have suffered due to their actions,\" Longstaff said.",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Thursday, Johnson & Johnson said inquiries about the claim \"would be best addressed by Kenvue, our former consumer health business, which separated from Johnson & Johnson in August 2023. As a part of that separation, Kenvue retained the responsibility and any purported liability for talc related litigation outside of the United States and Canada.\"",
      "Kenvue told the BBC in a statement that it sympathized \"deeply with people living with cancer. We understand that they and their families want answers \u2014\u202fthat's why the facts are so important,\" adding that the safety of its baby powder was backed by testing by \"independent and leading laboratories, universities, and health authorities in the U.K. and around the world\" over years.",
      "The company told BBC that the J&J baby powder \"was compliant with any required regulatory standards, did not contain asbestos, and does not cause cancer.\"",
      "Talc is a naturally occurring mineral that is often found together with asbestos during the mining process, which makes eliminating all traces of asbestos from talcum powder difficult.",
      "The claim alleges people who regularly used Johnson & Johnson talcum powders have developed, and in many cases died from, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma \u2014 another form of cancer \u2014 uterine fibroids and other diseases.",
      "\"My mother used it and I used it,\" 63-year old Siobhan Ryan told CBS News' news partner network BBC News. \"It smelled nice and was soft and lovely. When my babies were born I used it on them. I thought I was doing my best for them \u2026 It was such a shock. We just hugged and cried. I couldn't believe what I was hearing when the doctor told me I had stage-four ovarian cancer.\"",
      "Siobhan, who blames her cancer on Johnson & Johnson's baby powder, has been through three rounds of chemotherapy, near-fatal sepsis, and major abdominal surgery. Doctors say her cancer is no longer operable.",
      "\"They knew it was contaminated and still they sold it to new mums and their babies,\" she said.",
      "According to the U.K. claim, Johnson & Johnson began in the 1960s to commission scientists to analyze its talc-based products. In 1969, an internal memo stated that until tremolite \u2014 one of six types of asbestos \u2014 was proven to have no adverse effects, its use should be minimized, and noted that talc could no longer be guaranteed to be safe for babies.",
      "By the 1980s, it was widely accepted that all forms of asbestos were dangerous and could cause cancer, but Johnson & Johnson \u2014   and other firms \u2014   successfully lobbied the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to not regulate asbestos content in talc, according to the lawsuit.",
      "In 2018, the FDA finally began testing talcum powder and other related products for asbestos. A year later, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew a batch of its powder after the FDA found asbestos fibers in a sample.",
      "The U.K. claims will be decided by a judge, rather than a jury, at the U.K. High Court's Manchester Circuit Commercial Court.",
      "In a statement, Kenvue said it believes the judge will find that its talc-based powder did not cause cancer.",
      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to correct the attribution of the statement from Kenvue Ltd. to BBC News and to note that it is a separate company from J&J, not a subsidiary."

      "The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza was still holding Thursday despite strains over missing hostages' remains \u2014 including two U.S. nationals \u2014 and sporadic violence in the Palestinian enclave since the U.S. peace agreement came into effect almost a week ago.",
      "Mike Waltz, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, said Thursday that American personnel would be part of the effort to recover the remains of the 19 hostages that have yet to be turned over.",
      "Hamas returned the bodies of two more deceased Israeli hostages Wednesday night, bringing the total number returned to nine. But as video continued to emerge showing the staggering scale of destruction in Gaza, the group said it couldn't hand over any more remains without specialized equipment to find and retrieve the bodies.",
      "Israeli soldier Capt. Daniel Peretz was among the former hostages laid to rest in solemn ceremonies on Wednesday after his family finally received his body, which was held in Gaza for over two years. Peretz was killed fighting Hamas during the attack on Oct. 7, 2023. For his family, the day brought fresh pain.",
      "\"It's a new truth I have to face,\" said his sister Adina Peretz. \"It's proof, proof, that you are really gone.\"",
      "The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents Israeli hostage families, said this week that the peace process should not move forward until all the bodies are returned.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz, in a social media post on Monday, called Hamas' initial handover of only four bodies \"a violation of the agreement,\" adding that \"any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly.\"",
      "But senior U.S. advisers speaking to reporters on Wednesday in Washington urged patience, citing the difficulties in retrieving the remains. They said U.S. officials were not at a point where they believed the peace agreement had been violated by either side.",
      "\"Many of the Hamas commanders who are responsible for burying these Israeli hostages are no longer alive,\" Israeli hostage negotiator Gershon Baskin told CBS News on Wednesday. \"They were killed by the Israelis.\"",
      "Given that fact, and the perilous conditions inside the Palestinian territory, where there are unexploded bombs amid the piles of debris, Baskin said \"some of the deceased hostages may never be found, and that's part of the reality, but we have to make sure that Hamas is doing everything possible to do it.\"",
      "President Trump weighed in on the matter himself on Wednesday, telling reporters the recovery efforts \u2014 which international search and rescue experts are expected to join at some point \u2014 were \"a gruesome process.\"",
      "\"I almost hate to talk about it,\" said Mr. Trump. \"But they're digging. They're actually digging, areas where they're digging, and they're finding a lot of bodies. Then they have to separate the bodies.\"",
      "Waltz, President Trump's former National Security Advisor and the current U.N. ambassador, noted Thursday on Fox News that there were still two American nationals among the deceased hostages in Gaza.",
      "\"We will do everything to get them out,\" Walz said, adding that there was \"an entire task force\" including senior American officials, along with 200 U.S. troops, in the region \"to help with this and with the aid facilitation, and the Israelis are absolutely focused on it. So, they need heavy equipment. They need specialized gear. But we have to also understand that if this ceasefire falls apart, the fighting starts, that's going to make it that much harder to find these loved ones and get them out.\"",
      "The remains of American-Israeli nationals\u00a0Itay Chen and\u00a0Omer Neutra, both of whom were members of the Israel Defense Forces, have yet to be returned from Gaza.",
      "Turkey has offered its assistance in locating and retrieving the remains of the hostages still in Gaza, given the country's extensive expertise after recent\u00a0catastrophic earthquakes. No firm plans for such a deployment, from Turkey or any other nation, have been confirmed, but Turkish media said 81 personnel from that country alone could be sent to the region, including ten-person specialist search and rescue units.",
      "Israel said it would return the bodies of 15 Palestinians in exchange for the remains of every hostage handed back by Hamas as part of the peace deal, and the Red Cross has been transferring remains of Palestinians back to Gaza in recent days. But those returns, too, have been mired in controversy.",
      "\"We saw with our own eyes clear signs of torture and execution,\" Sameh Hamad, a member of a commission tasked with receiving the bodies at a hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis, told The Associated Press. \"Their hands and feet were cuffed, their eyes blindfolded.\"",
      "Hamas said in a statement on Thursday that \"horrifying scenes seen on the bodies\" handed over by Israel included \"signs of torture, mutilation, and field executions.\"",
      "The group called on human rights organizations and the United Nations \"to document these atrocious crimes, to open an urgent and comprehensive investigation, and to bring the leaders of the occupation to trial before the competent international courts.\"",
      "Former Israeli hostages have also spoken of torture at the hands of their Hamas captors in Gaza, including Keith Siegel, who was held for over a year.",
      "He told CBS' 60 Minutes in March that he witnessed the sexual assault of other hostages by Hamas militants, and that he was personally beaten, psychologically tortured and humiliated by his captors."

    "story": [
      "Former U.S. Marine Corps pilot Daniel Duggan on Thursday appealed his extradition from Australia to the United States over allegations that he illegally trained Chinese military aviators more than a decade ago.",
      "Duggan is accused of training Chinese military pilots while working as an instructor for the Test Flying Academy of South Africa in 2012. He appeared at the court in Canberra to file the appeal with his attorney after traveling 218 miles from a prison in Wellington, New South Wales state.",
      "Australian Federal Court Justice James Stellios will announce a verdict on a date yet to be set following a one-day hearing in the national capital Canberra.",
      "A 2016 indictment from the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., which was unsealed in late 2022, alleges Duggan conspired with others to provide training to Chinese military pilots in 2010 and 2012, and possibly other times, without applying for an appropriate license.",
      "The training involved \"instruction on the tactics, techniques, and procedures associated with launching aircraft from, and landing aircraft on, a naval aircraft carrier,\" the indictment said.",
      "Prosecutors allege Duggan received about nine payments totaling around 88,000 Australian dollars ($61,000) from another conspirator as well as travel to the U.S., South Africa and China for what was sometimes described as \"personal development training.\"",
      "Duggan lived and worked in China for about five years before his arrest, corporate records showed.",

    "summary": "Netanyahu discussed the Gaza peace plan and defended Israel's actions in the region.",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says he's prepared to \"give peace a chance\" \u2014 but \"the way you purchase peace is through strength,\" he told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil Tuesday in Tel Aviv.",
      "Netanyahu spoke to CBS News days after Hamas released the last 20 living hostages taken on Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel's military withdrew from parts of the Gaza Strip, in the first phase of a peace plan brokered by President Trump and Arab states. He weighed in on the future of Gaza, how Israel will react if Hamas doesn't disarm and the criticism Israel has faced during the war.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "Could Netanyahu regret releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the Israeli hostages?",
      "Netanyahu took a longer view when Dokoupil, in reference to the release of almost 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners in exchange for both the living and deceased Israeli hostages, asked him, \"Are you going to regret this decision?\"",
      "He responded that now, Israel is in a \"much better position\" to pursue Hamas if it fails to abide by the peace plan because there are no longer 20 Israeli hostages \"with their head on the chopping block.\"",
      "Dokoupil noted that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind of the Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack, was released in an exchange with Israel in 2011.",
      "Netanyahu acknowledged that the decision to release thousands of people \u2014 including 250 who were serving life sentences in Israeli prisons \u2014 was \"very painful.\"",
      "\"It's true that the worst ones among them we didn't release, but that's small comfort if your son or daughter was murdered by one of these people who were freed,\" he said.",
      "Releasing the Palestinian prisoners came with the understanding that \"there's an enormous price to pay for the commitment that Israel has to bring our hostages or captives held by the enemy,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Netanyahu claims ratio of civilians to combatants killed in Gaza is \"less than 2 to 1\"",
      "Asked by Dokoupil about the criticism that he's been \"negligent with civilian life in Gaza\" and whether his count of civilian deaths differed from that of the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, Netanyahu estimated \"20,000 Hamas terrorists\" had been killed by Israel.",
      "He added that that was the number \"if you take away the people who die anyway from disease or old age.\"",
      "Netanyahu argued, \"Take away the double counting and so on, the ratio is less than 2 to 1, which is unbelievable in urban conflict.\" It's a figure he also cited at the United Nations General Assembly in September, telling world leaders, \"The ratio of non-combatant to combatant casualties is less than 2 to 1 in Gaza.\"",
      "The Gaza Ministry of Health says nearly 70,000 Palestinians have been killed since Oct. 7, 2023. Its numbers do not differentiate between civilians and combatants. There are also an estimated 11,000 Gazans still missing, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, presumed to be buried beneath the rubble.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday that he believes roughly 60,000 people have died in Gaza.",
      "Netanyahu says finishing war \"as speedily as possible\" is \"first fix\" to combat young Americans' negative views of Israel",
      "Netanyahu cited the war's duration as one of the reasons that Americans' have an increasingly negative view of Israel. A Pew poll in late September found only 35% of the respondents had a positive opinion of Israel's government, down from 47% in 2022, before the war started. Among Americans under 30, only 13% said the U.S. was providing \"about the right amount of aid to Israel.\"",
      "\"The first fix is to finish the war as speedily as possible, something that I have sought to do against all this contrarian propaganda,\" he said.",
      "Netanyahu also blamed social media for fueling the outrage against Israel, saying that \"lies\" about the nation \"obviously does its damage.\"",
      "\"In the TikTok age and in the television age \u2026 letting wars go on too long is going to cost you precisely what it costs you.\" But he added, \"That can recover at least partly when you finish the war and you move on to what I hope will be the era of peace.\"",
      "Netanyahu on Trump saying he's hard to work with: \"I'm very tough\"",
      "In remarks to the Knesset on Monday, Mr. Trump said Netanyahu is \"not the easiest guy to deal with, but that's what makes him great.\"",
      "Netanyahu appeared to take pride in the characterization.",
      "\"I hope he says that, because I'm very tough on the matters that pertain to my country's future,\" he told Dokoupil. \"My job is to protect the Jewish state and assure the future of the Jewish people.\"",
      "Netanyahu says Hamas must disarm or \"all hell breaks loose\"",
      "\"We agreed to give peace a chance,\" Netanyahu said. But he also maintained that the conditions in Mr. Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza are \"very clear:\" Hamas must give up its arms and demilitarize, or \"all hell breaks loose.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has warned that if Hamas does not disarm, \"We will disarm them.\"",
      "\"And it'll happen quickly and perhaps violently,\" the president said. \"But they will disarm.\"",
      "Netanyahu told Dokoupil, \"I hope we can do this peacefully. We're certainly ready to do so.\"",
      "How will the Gaza Strip be governed?",
      "A major unresolved question is who will control the Gaza Strip as Israeli forces withdraw.",
      "Mr. Trump's peace plan calls for control over the territory to be handed over to a technocratic committee made up of Palestinians, overseen by a \"Board of Peace\" that includes Mr. Trump and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair. Hamas is not supposed to play any role in governance. But beyond that, it's unclear.",
      "Netanyahu said the exact structure for how the territory will be run is unsettled.",
      "Asked by Dokoupil if Blair would run Gaza himself, Netanyahu replied, \"I doubt it.\"",
      "\"But I think that this is a transitional period, and we want to fashion a governance that works, that is not made of people who are committed to our destruction,\" he said. \"We don't want to have the October 7th massacre repeated.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out the idea of allowing an independent Palestinian state, the solution that has been advocated by U.S. allies in Europe and the Arab world.",
      "He told Dokoupil that he supports Palestinians having the power to govern themselves, but would not support a Palestinian state with \"military power.\" \"That sovereign power of security must remain with Israel,\" the prime minister continued.",
      "The Israeli leader said the path forward should involve deradicalization and changes to the Palestinian education system. He also noted that many Gazans are opposed to Hamas or hold the group responsible for inflicting \"horrific misery\" on them.",
      "\"The most important thing in destroying fanaticism is to destroy a certain hope, the hope that the fanaticism will achieve its results,\" Netanyahu said. \"When people know Israel is here to stay, you're not going to destroy the Jewish state, Israel is too strong, that prepares the ground for a change of heart.\""

      "The body of another man in his 70s, also in Iwate, was found just two days later in a forest where he had been picking mushrooms. A few days earlier, the body of a 78-year-old man with multiple claw marks was recovered in the central prefecture of Nagano.",

      "Thousands of the animals are shot every year.",
      "The impacts of climate change on the bears' food sources and hibernation cycles has been cited by experts as a key factor, but there are also implications as Japan's aging population shrinks and humans abandon more rural areas.",

      "President Trump confirmed Wednesday that he has authorized the CIA to go into Venezuela and conduct covert operations.",
      "Asked by CBS News senior White House correspondent Ed O'Keefe why he did so, the president said he had two reasons: First, \"they have emptied their prisons into the United States of America\" and \"allowed thousands and thousands of prisoners\" and \"people from mental institutions, insane asylums\" into the U.S. Trump has frequently alleged \u2014 without citing evidence \u2014 that other countries are deliberately sending people from prisons and mental institutions to the southern border.",
      "He also cited the \"drugs coming in from Venezuela.\"",
      "\"A lot of the Venezuelan drugs come in from the sea. You get to see that,\" he told reporters at the White House in what seemed to be a reference to his administration's military airstrikes against suspected drug traffickers in waters off the coast of Venezuela. \"But we're gonna stop them by land, also.\"",
      "The New York Times first reported the president's authorization of CIA operations in Venezuela. Top Trump administration officials have accused Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of controlling the drug cartel Tren de Aragua, which Maduro denies, and the Justice Department has offered a reward for information leading to his capture. In August, the department doubled the bounty to\u00a0$50 million.",
      "Asked Wednesday whether the CIA had the authority to target Maduro, Mr. Trump said it would be \"a ridiculous question for me to answer,\" but \"I think Venezuela is feeling heat.\"",
      "The Venezuelan government condemned Mr. Trump's \"warmongering and extravagant\" comments in a statement, and accused the U.S. of seeking \"regime change\" in Venezuela.",
      "On Tuesday, the president said that the U.S. had struck another small boat off the coast of Venezuela, killing six people. It was the fifth\u00a0such strike in the Caribbean, where the Trump administration has asserted its authority to treat alleged drug traffickers as unlawful combatants who may be attacked with military force. At least 27 people have been killed in the five strikes, according to figures released by the administration.",
      "Mr. Trump has also deployed eight warships, a nuclear-powered submarine and fighter jets to the region as part of what he has said is as an operation to combat drug smuggling into the United States.",
      "CBS News has also learned there are about 10,000 U.S. forces built up in the Caribbean either on ships or in Puerto Rico.",
      "After the U.S.' latest boat strike, Maduro\u00a0on Wednesday ordered military exercises in the country's biggest shantytowns.",
      "The strikes on alleged drug boats have drawn pushback from lawmakers in both parties. Critics note that Congress hasn't authorized military force against drug traffickers, and argue the Trump administration hasn't provided enough evidence about who was on the boats and what narcotics they were carrying.",
      "Asked by O'Keefe about those concerns, Mr. Trump said lawmakers \"are given information that they were loaded up with drugs, and that's the thing that matters.\" He alleged that \"fentanyl dust\" has been found on the boats after the strikes.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0The world of professional sumo wrestling stepped outside of Japan for only the second time in its centuries-long history on Wednesday night, as fighters clashed on a specially constructed ring in the middle of London's Royal Albert Hall.",
      "The iconic venue in the British capital is hosting the Grand Sumo Tournament\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the roughly 1,500-year-old sport's most important competition\u00a0\u2014\u00a0for the second time, drawing more than 44 professional wrestlers, or Rikishi, to compete in 100 bouts over five days. The only other time the tournament was held outside Japan was in 1991, when it also came to the Royal Albert Hall.",
      "There are unique challenges in bringing sumo to London, as the contemporary national sport of Japan is rooted in two millennia of tradition, interwoven with the Shinto religion, and thus treated with the utmost respect and protection to ensure adherence to its rituals and norms.",
      "\"One of the things that we've worked really hard at is to make sure that we have a good understanding of the cultural and religious significance that sumo has,\" Matthew Todd, the Royal Albert Hall's programming director, told CBS News.",
      "He said attention to detail was \"really critical to the authentic presentation that we're able to make here.\"",
      "That meant shipping 11 tons of clay from Japan to construct the ring, or dohyo, in the center of the concert venue, where the wrestlers compete. Shipping containers were at sea for three months making the voyage. A big team of ring attendants (yobisdashi), also had to make the trip from Japan\u00a0\u2014\u00a0alongside 11 interpreters to help them communicate with British workers.",
      "The roof for the dohyo, now suspended from the Albert Hall ceiling, was built in Britain, but its design is taken straight from traditional Japanese Shinto shrines, which, according to Todd, \"helps to show that this is a sacred area,\" in which routines and holy ceremonies are conducted as part of the tournament.",
      "It's a vital step, he said, to ensure the Shinto gods are paid their due respects before the fights.",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Female sumo wrestlers fight for visibility in Japan's male-dominated sport",
      "Sumo is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture and religion in ways that many Western sports fans may find difficult to comprehend. According to legend, it originated as a ritual to ask the gods for a bountiful harvest, but it transformed over almost 2,000 years into the sport it is today, drawing competitors still primarily from Japan, but also from around the world.",
      "Many of the most recent champions have been from Mongolia, and this year's tournament features two rishiki from Ukraine. While Americans have competed successfully in past tournaments, there are no U.S. rishiki competing in this year's event in London.",
      "The nuance of the wrestling competition itself can also be difficult to fully grasp, with 82 winning techniques called kimirate, numerous ranks and divisions and a host of other rules. So to help translate all this for a largely Western audience, in-ear English language commentary is provided at the Royal Albert Hall, alongside video replay screens to describe and explain the bouts, which can sometimes end in just seconds when a competitor is forced out of the ring.",
      "The wrestlers themselves live an incredibly regimented life. They are forbidden from driving cars and, somewhat counterintuitively, eating breakfast, and are normally required to take a long nap after their hefty lunch, to help them pack on the pounds.",
      "The average weight of a rikishi is about 330 pounds, but some tip the scales at 550.",
      "They have been given some leave during their visit to the British capital to enjoy themselves, however\u00a0\u2014\u00a0with organizers likely seeing the value in some degree of publicity.",
      "During the lead-up to the tournament, social media platforms were full of photos and videos of the traditionally kimono-clad wrestlers sightseeing around London.",
      "The Albert Hall will also be graced this week by the presence of two yokozuna, the highest ranking of all sumo wrestlers. The word yokozuna is generally translated as grand champion, but it translates literally to \"horizontal rope,\" in a reference to the special rope worn around their waists to display their rank.",
      "Once a rishiki is promoted to the rank of yokozuna, they keep it until retirement. In nearly 400 years of professional sumo, only 75 men have attained the vaunted grand champion status. The honor typically requires not only multiple consecutive championship wins, but approval by a dedicated council that judges rishiki on their wrestling skills, but also a range of other personal attributes.",
      "The tournament is due to end on Sunday, when the wrestler with the most victories in the ring will be crowned this year's champion.",
      "The field is considered wide open this year, but many, especially back at home in Japan, will be hoping for 25-year-old Yokozuna Onasato, the country's first grand champion in almost a decade, to emerge victorious."

    "story": [
      "Uruguay's senate passed a law decriminalizing euthanasia on Wednesday, putting the South American nation among a handful of other countries where seriously ill patients can legally obtain help to end their lives.",
      "It makes Uruguay the first country in predominantly Catholic Latin America to allow euthanasia via legislation. Colombia and Ecuador have decriminalized the practice through Supreme Court decisions.",
      "In Chile, left-wing President Gabriel Boric recently revived a push for the approval of an euthanasia bill long stalled in the Senate.",
      "Fierce debates and spirited activism around the practice has gripped the region in recent years.",

      "U.K. lawmakers back medically assisted dying bill",
      "U.K. lawmakers back medically assisted dying bill",
      "The law, which moved forward in fits and starts over the last five years, cleared its final hurdle on Wednesday as 20 out of 31 senators voted in favor. The lower house approved the bill in August with a large majority. All that's left is for the government to implement the regulations.",
      "During the debate, senators from the ruling Broad Front coalition delivered impassioned defenses of the right to die, comparing the euthanasia movement to the legalization of divorce and same-sex marriage.",
      "\"We all believe and feel that life is a right, both in health and in sickness, but it should never be an obligation because others don't understand such unbearable suffering,\" Sen. Daniel Borbonet said, after quoting testimony from Uruguayan patients with irreversible medical conditions.",
      "Most opposition to euthanasia in Uruguay came from the Catholic Church. Before the vote, Daniel Sturla, the archbishop of Montevideo, called on Uruguayans \"to defend the gift of life and to remember that every person deserves to be cared for, accompanied and supported until the end.\"",
      "But secularization has eroded resistance to the practice in this country of 3.5 million people, which bans any mention of God in oaths of office and calls Christmas \"Family Day.\"",
      "Officials hailed the law's passage as reinforcing Uruguay's reputation as among the most socially liberal nations in the region. The country was first in the world to legalize marijuana for recreational use and passed pioneering legislation allowing same-sex marriage and abortion over a decade ago. Both laws were passed by secular, socially liberal former President Jos\u00e9 Mujica, who died aged 89 in May.",
      "\"This is a historic event, which places Uruguay at the forefront in addressing deeply human and sensitive issues,\" said Vice President Carolina Cosse.",
      "The legislation permits euthanasia, performed by a health care professional, but not assisted dying, which involves a patient self-administering a lethal dose of prescribed medication.",
      "Unlike laws in U.S. states, Australia and New Zealand restricting assisted dying to those with a life expectancy of no more than six months or a year, Uruguay sets no time limits. It also does not require a waiting period, and allows anyone suffering from an incurable illness that causes \"unbearable suffering\" to seek assisted death, even if their diagnosis is not terminal.",
      "Uruguay requires those seeking euthanasia to be mentally competent.",
      "Although the law does not outright ban euthanasia for those with mental conditions like depression, it requires that patients get two doctors to rule that they are psychologically fit enough to make the decision.",
      "Unlike Belgium, Colombia and the Netherlands, Uruguay will not allow euthanasia for minors."

    "story": [
      "Hamas said Wednesday it has handed over all the Israeli hostage remains in Gaza that it has been able to recover, and that extensive efforts and special equipment are required to find the remaining bodies.",
      "The Red Cross said it received two more coffins containing the remains of deceased hostages, which were being transferred to Israeli authorities, the Israel Defense Forces and Israeli Security Agency said in a joint statement. The IDF said late Wednesday night local time that the coffins had entered Israel and were being taken to the National Centre for Forensic Medicine for identification.",
      "\"Hamas is required to uphold the agreement and take the necessary steps to return all the hostages,\" the IDF said in a statement.",
      "The return of the hostages is a cornerstone of the Gaza peace plan, which called for Hamas to hand over all remaining hostages \u2014 20 living and 28 dead \u2014 by Monday, Oct. 13.",
      "Since the plan took effect last week, Hamas has been accused of delaying handing over the remains of Israeli hostages still believed to be in the Palestinian territory.",
      "While Hamas returned the 20 living hostages by the Monday deadline, the remains of only four deceased Israeli captives were handed over. Hamas transferred an additional four bodies on Tuesday, but the IDF said one of them was not a hostage. That means the remains of at least 19 hostages are still unaccounted for.",
      "A senior U.S. adviser told reporters on a call Wednesday that \"nobody is getting left behind,\" noting they believe there are still many bodies buried under the mountains of rubble across Gaza. Senior U.S. advisers said the level of destruction also makes it difficult to move around in the Palestinian territory.",
      "\"It would have been almost impossible for Hamas to mobilize, even if they knew where all the 28 bodies were, to mobilize and get them home,\" one adviser said.",
      "Strikingly, the adviser said that the U.S. is sharing Israeli intelligence with Hamas to assist in finding hostage remains. The adviser also said Turkey has offered to help search for and retrieve remains by sending in expert teams with experience rescuing people from the frequent earthquakes in the country.",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a social media post on Monday that Hamas' initial return of only four bodies constituted \"a violation of the agreement\" and added that \"any delay or deliberate avoidance will be considered a gross violation of the agreement and will be responded to accordingly.\"",
      "During negotiations that led to the deal, Hamas representatives said they did not know the location of all the remains of deceased hostages, according to Israeli media reports. President Trump also said in Egypt on Monday that not all of the bodies of the deceased hostages had been found, adding that unidentified parties were still \"working out\" how to locate an unspecified number of remains.",
      "Both the Israeli Hostages and Missing Families Forum, the group that represents the hostage families, and Israel's defense minister have said the entire peace deal should be shelved until all of the hostages' remains are returned by Hamas.",
      "Senior U.S. advisers who spoke to reporters on Wednesday, citing the difficulties in retrieving the remains still in Gaza, urged patience and said they are not at a point where they feel that the agreement has been violated.",
      "Even if these issues are resolved, the 20-point peace plan still faces other considerable hurdles. Hamas wants the Israeli military \u2014 which still occupies more than half of Gaza \u2014 to withdraw entirely. But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil on Tuesday that the conditions of the plan \"are very clear \u2014 it's not only that we get the hostages out without getting our military out, but that we would subsequently have both demilitarization and disarmament. They're not the same thing. First, Hamas has to give up its arms. And second, you want to make sure that there are no weapons factories inside Gaza. There's no smuggling of weapons into Gaza.\"",
      "But Hamas has rejected calls to disarm, and, since the start of the ceasefire, CBS News' team in Gaza has seen Hamas back on the streets, still armed, and reportedly confronting rival groups. Mr. Trump on Tuesday warned that if Hamas does not disarm, \"we will disarm them,\" adding: \"It'll happen quickly and perhaps violently. But they will disarm.\"",
      "Netanyahu said he heard Mr. Trump's remarks, paraphrasing them as \"all hell breaks loose.\"",
      "\"Well, I hope it doesn't,\" Netanyahu told Dokoupil. \"I hope we can do this peacefully. We're certainly ready to do so.\""

      "Drone footage captured by photographer Vadim Makhorov shows the large bears getting comfortable in the remains of a Soviet-era weather station on Kolyuchin Island. The tiny island is about seven miles from the coast of the Chukotka Peninsula, which faces Alaska, the Associated Press said. The station was abandoned in the 1990s, after the Soviet Union fell,\u00a0the BBC reported.",

      "\"Bears are no strangers to the feeling of comfort and coziness,\" Makhorov said in the post. \"They perceive homes as shelter.\"",
      "Makharov said that there were about 20 bears in the area, with a bed of walruses near the research station. A birds-eye photo shows several structures in various states of disrepair, with some debris scattered around the area. Other images show the bears resting outside. One bear tried to catch Makhorov's drone as it approached, video showed.",
      "\"Polar bears are extremely dangerous predators, but why do they look so cute and friendly in photos?\" he added in another post.",
      "It's not the first time polar bears have been intrigued by human settlements. In 2016, a group of seven bears besieged five researchers at a weather station on a\u00a0Russian island in the Arctic. A passing ship delivered flares and deployed a helicopter to chase away the animals, which had killed one of the station's two dogs and smashed windows at the research site. The bears were eventually driven away.",
      "Hungry polar bears have also approached residential areas and even airports while searching for food. The animals are considered a protected species and rarely pose a threat to humans, but can be deadly. A worker at a remote government radar site in the Canadian Arctic was\u00a0killed by a pair of polar bears in 2024.",
      "Warming temperatures in the Arctic is changing polar bears' behavior, experts told CBS News. Scientists from Polar Bear International told CBS News that melting sea ice and other environmental changes are keeping bears closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs they typically prey on. The species is also experiencing a loss in genetic diversity as the species inbreeds in a fight to survive. A 2020 study found that polar bears\u00a0could be extinct\u00a0by 2100."

An international medical charity said at least five people were killed Wednesday amid explosions in Kabul, but the cause of the blasts could not be immediately confirmed.",
      "Mujahid said Taliban forces responded on Wednesday, killing several \"invading Pakistani soldiers.\"",

      "Mujahid said  that under the ceasefire agreement, the fighting would stop, \"at the request and insistence of the Pakistani side,\" at 5:30 p.m. local time (which was 8:30 a.m. Eastern). He said the Taliban had instructed all of its forces to observe the ceasefire, \"as long as no one commits an act of aggression.\"",

      "\"We started receiving ambulances filled with wounded people, and we learned that there had been explosions a few kilometres away from our hospital,\" Emergency's country director in Afghanistan, Dejan Panic, said in a statement, adding that women and children were among the wounded.",
      "Emergency did not speculate about what had caused the casualties, and the Taliban also reported the explosion of a fuel tanker in the capital on Wednesday, seemingly unrelated to the Pakistani strikes.",
      "Pakistan said after its first airstrikes that it took the action because the Taliban was providing sanctuary and support for members of Tahrik-e Taliban Pakistani, or the TTP, often referred to as the Pakistani Taliban, inside Afghanistan. The TTP has staged deadly attacks targeting Pakistani security forces and civilians for years.",

      "In an Instagram post on Aug. 26, Swift and Kelce announced their engagement after two years of dating. At the time, the Prince and Princess of Wales' Instagram account left an official \"like\" on the post.",
      "It marked the first meeting between the pop star and the royal.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "According to royal experts, William and Middleton's attendance at the wedding would be fitting as it would symbolize mutual admiration and help modernize the monarchy\u2019s image among younger audiences.",
      "Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams told Fox News Digital that it would be \"totally appropriate\" for William and Middleton to accept an invitation to Swift and Kelce's wedding if one were to be extended.",
      "\"Queen Elizabeth famously told Michelle Obama that royal protocol was \u2018rubbish,\u2019\" Fitzwilliams said of the 2009 exchange between the late monarch and the former first lady, which Michelle detailed in her 2018 memoir \"Becoming.\"",
      "LIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS",
      "\"Much of it is what is considered appropriate by the royals themselves and obviously, as William has recently emphasized, there are periodic changes to royal attitudes,\" Fitzwilliams continued.",
      "\"A higher profile enables the royals to get their charitable messages across and this would also increase their appeal among the young,\" he added. \"It would be a genuine mixture of admiration, helping to cement Anglo-American relations especially to a younger generation and, of course, the royals are well aware of the wonderful PR opportunities this would offer.\"",
      "Royal experts weighed in on whether William and Middleton would accept a potential invitation.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "Meanwhile, former royal photographer Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital that if William and Middleton were invited to the wedding and decided to attend, their presence would not be motivated by promotional considerations.",
      "\"The Royals have often attended as guests at weddings and tend to keep an appreciative but low profile so as not to take away from the happy couple's big day,\" he said.",
      "Turner continued, \"They would not see it as a PR opportunity just to be part of a wonderful celebration of marriage, and they would insist to be treated as any other guest with no protocol procedures.\"",
      "While security would likely already be tight at Swift and Kelce's high-profile nuptials, royal commentator Hilary Fordwich noted that the royal couple's attendance would require additional precautions.",
      "\"If they were to attend, security would be heightened, of course, with a mix of police, private security and royal protection officers,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"There would be extensive risk assessments, an advance team with site checks as well as strict robust guest screening protocols put in place.\"",
      "\"While royal attendance would be permissible at Taylor Swift\u2019s wedding, it would be subject to extremely careful protocol as well as significant security concerns,\" she continued. \"Less tangible but just as complex would be the PR ramifications regarding royal brand management and the celebrity-type symbolic meaning royals have tended, historically, to avoid.\"",
      "\"However, it\u2019s not unprecedented,\" Fordwich added. \"The Prince and Princess of Wales have on so very many occasions been modernizing the monarchy and are very aware that their future will be shaped and impacted by their ability to appeal to younger demographics.\"",
      "Swift and Kelce haven't publicly announced their wedding date.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "If the royals are unable to attend Swift and Kelce's wedding, the singer would be just as pleased with another gesture from the royal couple, according to U.K. royal correspondent Neil Sean.",
      "\"Insiders tell me that Miss Swift would be equally happy with a personalized message from William and Catherine where it could be played out, say at their evening function, wishing her and her man Travis Kelce all the very best for the future,\" Sean told Fox News Digital.",
      "Fitzwilliams pointed out that if the wedding were to take place in 2026, the royal couple's attendance would be a \"highly significant\" gesture as the United States will celebrate its 250th anniversary next year.",
      "Fitzwilliams agreed with Fordwich's assessment that if William and Middleton were invited to the couple's wedding, it wouldn't be without precedent.",
      "\"The Waleses were asked to the Beckham\u2019s wedding in 2022 but were unable to attend,\" he noted of the nuptials between Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"Numerous celebrities have attended royal weddings since Princess Margaret\u2019s in 1960,\" Fitzwilliams added. \"The only pity is that George, Charlotte and Louis are probably too young to go. Catherine is in remission, and the matter of her health is obviously pivotal to whether she would be able to attend.\"",
      "\"If she could not, William should go by himself. It would be an event for much rejoicing, a real \u2018love story.\u2019\"",

Sometimes, I rather think it would be a comfort.\"",
      "\"I can say that now, because it\u2019s been over a dozen years, which is a sufficient amount of time to be able to reflect back calmly, and perhaps with a healthy dose of disassociation,\" he wrote. \"At the time, if I\u2019m being honest, I was just astonished to be lying there.\"",

      "\"I don't know when the paralysis set in; initially it just felt very strange that the left side of my body had gone numb,\" Curry said.",
      "He wrote that he was transferred two days later to Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where his longtime personal assistant and publicist Marcia Hurwitz helped him be admitted under an alias to protect his identity and prevent his stroke from being made public.",
      "\"After regaining consciousness, I could comprehend words but they did not register or settle without effort. Life was exceedingly dull, monotonous, and uncertain for a long while, Curry wrote. \"I was aware of where I was, but it took me a while to fully accept what had happened, as I imagine is the case with many people getting over a stroke and brain surgery.\"",
      "\"My skull had been smashed in to save my life,\" he continued. \"That\u2019s plenty to process. I needed the rest and slept a lot.\"",
      "Curry wrote that he spent months at the hospital before eventually entering a rehabilitation center \"where the real exercises began: to retrieve my ability to speak clearly, to work on smiling and facial expressions, and to try using my hand and adapting to my new normal.\"",
      "\"I was living in a fog. I looked frightful, and I couldn\u2019t speak clearly for ages. That part was exceptionally frustrating, because thoughts were forming again, but articulating them was such a monumental stretch,\" he recalled. \"I felt like there was a massive gulf between my mind and what emerged from my mouth.\"",
      "\"Half sentences here or there would make it, but it took a while \u2014 which amounted to a whole lot of time dwelling in my own head,\" Curry continued. \"Being unable to string together and clearly deliver a sentence was absolute misery for somebody who values words and conversation as much as I do.\"",

      "\"The Three Musketeers\" star also poked fun at rumors that he had died, writing, \"Contrary to village gossip, I am still very much alive.\"",
      "\"I try to avoid complaining too much. (I prefer doing it just enough.) But I do have the material: as I write this I\u2019m confined to a wheelchair, having never managed to walk again,\" he wrote.",
      "\"Even so, whining is a f---ing bore for everybody involved\u2014and it\u2019s highly unproductive,\" Curry continued. \"I\u2019d rather spend my time focusing on other things.\"",
      "\"The different ways that people cope with pain is quite interesting,\" he added. \"I do not consider it an act of tremendous courage or bravery that I resort to humor in moments of great discomfort. It\u2019s just my go-to. I am sure it\u2019s partially a survival skill I developed a very long time ago, to the extent that humor can be developed.\"",

      "\"It wasn\u2019t something I had practiced before the stroke. I was always a forward-thinker; I never wanted to return to my childhood home, or to the stages, sets, and studios of my past.

      "The decline could also signal the fizzling out of a trend, Kaufmann added.",

      "\"It brings up more questions than it answers,\" the doctor, who was not involved in the survey, told Fox News Digital. \"Could the change be due to a changing cultural climate? Less political pressure from parents and society? Could it be due to the idea that gender dysphoria resolves in many cases?\"",
      "Rather than rejecting who they are, young people may simply be tired of feeling pressured to define every emotion or difference with a new identity, a psychotherapist suggested.\u00a0 (iStock)",

      "Jonathan Alpert, a New York City psychotherapist, said this shift likely marks a \"natural correction.\"",

Hackers did not breach company networks directly or exploit vulnerabilities in Salesforce's core software. Instead, they targeted the tools and people around it by tricking employees into granting access, compromising third-party apps and abusing overly broad permissions.",
      "Once inside, they siphoned sensitive data from Salesforce environments on an unprecedented scale.

      "Hackers are weaponizing stolen Salesforce credentials to access company secrets. (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid)",
      "Why Salesforce is the perfect target",
      "Salesforce is not just another cloud platform. It is the backbone of how thousands of companies manage relationships with their customers. The platform powers everything from sales pipelines and marketing campaigns to support tickets and partner communications. Banks use it to track client accounts, airlines rely on it to manage frequent flyer programs, and retailers store customer purchase histories and loyalty data inside it. In many organizations, Salesforce sits at the center of daily operations, acting as a single system that touches sensitive information across departments.",
      "That is why the scale of these breaches is so significant. A successful attack on a Salesforce instance becomes a window into a company's customers, business strategy and internal processes. For cybercriminals, the potential payoff is enormous, and the recent incidents showed just how much damage they can cause without ever breaking into a company's primary network.",
      "The breaches hit companies across sectors, from Adidas and Allianz to Qantas, Google and Pandora Jewelry. Attackers often use voice-phishing calls or realistic fake apps to manipulate Salesforce administrators into installing malicious software. This allowed them to steal OAuth tokens and query data directly from CRM systems, a technique linked to groups like ShinyHunters.",
      "Other attacks originated in compromised third-party integrations. One of the most damaging involved a chatbot tool called Drift, where stolen tokens gave attackers access to Salesforce instances at hundreds of companies.",
      "The fallout was enormous. Coca-Cola's European division lost more than 23 million CRM records, while Farmers Insurance and Allianz Life reported breaches affecting over a million customers each. Even Google admitted that attackers accessed a Salesforce database used for advertising leads.",

      "Major brands like Google, Dior and Allianz are among those caught in the data fallout. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Exploiting weak links in the ecosystem",
      "It's hard to break through firewalls or exploit technical vulnerabilities, but it's much easier to manipulate people. Attackers have figured this out, and they are now focusing their efforts on human behavior and the less-protected edges of cloud ecosystems. Employees with administrative privileges were often tricked into authorizing malicious apps, while default permission settings allowed those apps to operate undetected.",
      "Once they obtained the data, the hackers did not simply try to sell it. They used it as leverage. Earlier this month, a loosely organized cybercrime group known by names such as Lapsus$, Scattered Spider and ShinyHunters launched a dedicated data leak site on the dark web, threatening to publish sensitive information unless victims paid a ransom.",
      "As reported, the site is designed to pressure companies into paying to prevent their stolen data from being made public. \"Contact us to regain control of your data governance and prevent public disclosure,\" reads one message on the site. \"Do not be the next headline. All communications require strict verification and will be handled with discretion.\"",
      "The leak site lists several alleged victims, including FedEx, Hulu (owned by Disney) and Toyota Motors. It is also unclear whether some of the organizations known to have been breached but not listed on the site have paid ransoms to keep their data from being released.",
      "FARMERS INSURANCE DATA BREACH EXPOSES 1.1M AMERICANS",
      "Cybercriminals are now extorting victims online, threatening to leak billions of stolen records. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Salesforce's response",
      "Salesforce told Cyberguy that it is \"aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors\" and will not engage with, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demands. A company spokesperson provided the following statement:",
      "\"We are aware of recent extortion attempts by threat actors, which we have investigated in partnership with external experts and authorities. Our findings indicate these attempts relate to past or unsubstantiated incidents, and we remain engaged with affected customers to provide support. At this time, there is no indication that the Salesforce platform has been compromised, nor is this activity related to any known vulnerability in our technology.\"",
      "6 steps you can take to protect your data",
      "You might think a breach like this is a company problem, something for IT teams and cybersecurity experts to deal with. However, when attackers gain access to platforms like Salesforce, the data they are after is usually not the company's. It is yours. Your contact details, purchase history, support tickets and even private conversations can end up in the wrong hands. And once that happens, the risks do not stay confined to one company. That is why it is worth taking a few proactive steps now, even if the company has not contacted you about an incident yet.",
      "If you have interacted with any of the companies mentioned in the breach, or suspect your data might be part of it, change your passwords for those services immediately. Better yet, use a password manager to generate strong, unique passwords for every site. A good tool will also alert you if any of your credentials appear in future data leaks.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Even if a password is stolen, two-factor authentication\u00a0(2FA) adds a crucial extra layer of security. Enable it for your email, banking apps, cloud storage and any service that offers it. It is one of the simplest ways to block attackers from hijacking your accounts with stolen credentials.",
      "Even if your data was part of a breach, you can still limit how much of it is floating around online. Personal data removal services scan and delete your personal information from data broker websites that sell or share your details without consent. These brokers often trade in names, addresses, phone numbers and even purchase histories, the same type of data leaked in Salesforce-related breaches.",
      "By removing your records from these public databases, you make it far harder for scammers, identity thieves and marketers to find or misuse your information. Many services, like Incogni, handle the entire opt-out process automatically and keep monitoring to ensure your data stays removed.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Attackers who have CRM data often know more about you than a typical scammer. They might reference past purchases, support cases, or other personal details to make their messages sound legitimate. Treat unexpected emails, texts, or phone calls with suspicion, especially if they involve links or requests for payment.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Data breaches do not always result in immediate damage. Sometimes, criminals sit on stolen data for months before using it. These services can continuously monitor the dark web for your personal information and notify you if your data appears in new leaks. That gives you time to act before problems snowball.",
      "Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If you think your data was exposed, companies are legally obligated in most regions to inform you. Do not hesitate to contact them directly and ask for details on what was stolen and what steps they are taking to protect affected customers. The more pressure users apply, the more likely companies are to tighten security practices.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Attackers can expose your personal data even if you are careful. They gain access to corporate cloud environments and can see customer names, emails, purchase histories and other sensitive details. For users, this means it is crucial to stay vigilant. Criminal groups use this stolen information to launch targeted phishing attacks, open fake accounts, or impersonate you elsewhere. Some even cross-reference leaked Salesforce data with information from previous breaches to build disturbingly complete profiles of their victims.",

Researchers at Germany's Fraunhofer Institute have developed a fabric embedded with sensors and AI algorithms that can monitor road conditions from beneath the surface. This smart material could make costly, disruptive road repairs far more efficient and sustainable.",

      "The system uses a fabric made from flax fibers interwoven with ultra-thin conductive wires. These wires detect minute changes in the asphalt base layer, signaling potential damage before it reaches the surface.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Fraunhofer researchers test AI sensors that detect road damage beneath the surface.\u00a0 (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "Once the fabric is laid under the road, it continuously collects data. A connected unit on the roadside stores and transmits this data to an AI system that analyzes it for early warning signs. As vehicles pass over the road, the system measures changes in resistance within the fabric. These changes reveal how the base layer is performing and whether cracks or strain are forming beneath the surface.",
      "Why AI road monitoring matters for future maintenance",
      "Traditional road inspection methods rely on drilling or taking core samples, which are destructive, costly and only provide information for a small section of pavement. This AI-driven system eliminates the need for that kind of invasive testing.",
      "Instead of reacting to surface damage, transportation agencies could predict and prevent deterioration before it becomes expensive to fix. The approach could extend road life, cut down on traffic delays and help governments spend infrastructure funds more efficiently.",

      "The smart flax-fiber fabric measures stress changes in asphalt to spot cracks early. (Fraunhofer Institute)",
      "How AI and sensor data predict road damage early",
      "The real power comes from combining AI algorithms with continuous sensor feedback. Fraunhofer's machine-learning software can forecast how damage will spread, helping engineers prioritize which roads need maintenance first. Data from the sensors is displayed on a web-based dashboard, offering a clear visual of road health for local agencies and planners.",
      "The project, called SenAD2, is currently being tested in an industrial zone in Germany. Early results suggest the system can identify internal damage without disrupting traffic or damaging the road itself.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Smarter road monitoring could lead to fewer potholes, smoother commutes and less taxpayer money wasted on inefficient repairs. If adopted widely, cities could plan maintenance years in advance, avoiding the cycle of patchwork fixes that often make driving a daily headache.",

Recently, a\u00a0father lost $4 million in Bitcoin to vishing. Though\u00a0AI voice cloning has improved, it\u2019s still flawed. You can spot inconsistencies by verifying the speaker's identity. Ask specific questions that only the real person would know. This can reveal gaps in the scammer's script. The voice, also, at times may sound robotic due to imperfections in voice cloning technology. So the next time, whenever you receive a call that creates a sense of urgency, ask as many questions as you can to verify the identity of the person. You may also consider verifying the claims through the second channel. If the person on the other side of the phone says something, you can get it confirmed by the official email to be on the safer side.",

The reusable reentry vehicle can transport up to 500 pounds of mission-critical cargo to nearly any point on the planet in less than an hour. Founders Justin Fiaschetti and Austin Briggs launched the company in 2021 with a bold vision: to build a space-based logistics network. During an event at the company's factory, they described Arc as the next evolution of global delivery, one that starts in orbit, not on the ground.",

      "How the Arc spacecraft delivers cargo from orbit to Earth",
      "Standing about 8 feet tall and 4 feet wide, Arc is roughly the size of a large tabletop. It's a lifting-body vehicle, meaning it can steer as it reenters the atmosphere. Instead of needing a runway, Arc lands safely under parachutes, using non-toxic propellants that make it safe to handle immediately after landing. The spacecraft features a cross-range of approximately 621 miles, allowing it to target wide landing zones. It can stay in orbit for up to five years, ready to return to Earth when needed. That flexibility means the spacecraft could one day drop off medical supplies, drones or military equipment at hard-to-reach locations.",

Those capabilities have caught the attention of U.S. defense agencies, which are eager to improve hypersonic flight testing. Inversion's participation in the Kratos-led MACH-TB 2.0 program highlights the growing military interest in Arc's reusable design. \"Fully reusable and capable of precise landings for rapid recovery, Arc makes hypersonic testing faster, repeatable, and more affordable,\" the company said.",

      "Before Arc, Inversion launched a smaller demo craft called Ray on SpaceX's Transporter-12 mission. Ray weighed about 200 pounds and successfully tested propulsion, avionics and solar power systems in orbit. Though a short circuit prevented reentry, it provided valuable data that led to Arc's development. Ray's success convinced the company to push forward with full-scale testing. Inversion has already completed dozens of drop tests and built a full-scale Arc prototype. The startup also partnered with NASA to refine the vehicle's thermal protection system for reentry.",

      "Why fake settlement sites are so convincing",
      "Settlement claim websites rarely look polished. Most have generic layouts, long URLs and simple forms asking for a claim ID from your email or postcard. That makes it easy for scammers to mimic them. To test how simple it is, we created a fake settlement site (below) in minutes using AI tools like ChatGPT.",

      "If we can do it, you can bet criminals are already exploiting the same shortcuts. Facebook has been the target. A fake site once popped up around the Equifax settlement, tricking thousands before it was shut down. The lesson? If the site appears unusual, it doesn't necessarily mean it's fake, but it should prompt you to double-check before entering your details or clicking on any links.",
      "Red flags that expose fake settlement sites",
      "Spotting a scam often comes down to noticing the little details. Watch for these common warning signs before you hand over your information.",
      "If a site asks for your full Social Security number or the names of your children, stop. For example, the official Equifax settlement only requested the last six digits of SSNs.

    "summary": "Comprehensive analysis of Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps examines usability, routing accuracy, data handling and features across the top navigation platforms.",
    "story": [
      "Kurt \u2018CyberGuy\u2019 Knutsson discusses Instagram\u2019s new maps feature and more on \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend.\u2019",
      "Navigation apps have become an essential part of modern life. Whether you are commuting to work, running errands or exploring a new city, relying on accurate directions and real-time traffic updates can make all the difference. Over the past decade, Google Maps, Waze and Apple Maps have emerged as the dominant players in this space, each offering a distinct approach to navigation.",
      "While millions of people rely on these apps daily, choosing the right one can depend on a variety of factors, from interface design to privacy policies. In this article, we compare these three apps across usability, accuracy, features and data handling to help you determine which one best fits your needs.",

      "What each app does best",
      "Google Maps is widely regarded as the all-rounder. It combines extensive mapping data with points of interest, public transit information, Street View, Live View AR and detailed business listings. Its versatility makes it a top choice for both daily commuters and travelers.",
      "Google Maps is a great way to explore the world with detailed routes, Street View, and real-time traffic insights. (OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Waze, on the other hand, is designed primarily for drivers. It thrives on community input, offering live updates about traffic jams, road hazards, accidents and even police presence. Since Google owns Waze, many Waze-style real-time alerts have now begun appearing directly inside Google Maps. While Waze still focuses on driving, this integration blurs the lines between the two apps.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0has made major strides in recent years. Once considered the underdog, it's now a solid choice for iOS users. Its clean interface, privacy-focused design and seamless integration with Siri, CarPlay and Apple Watch make it a convenient pick for those fully in the Apple ecosystem.",
      "INSTAGRAM FRIEND MAP FEATURE SPARKS PRIVACY QUESTIONS",
      "Usability and interface",
      "When it comes to interface, each app approaches design differently.",
      "Google Maps provides a dense but intuitive layout, giving users access to multiple layers of information, including traffic, satellite imagery and public transit routes. Switching between driving, walking, biking and transit is straightforward, and the search functionality is robust, often displaying detailed business profiles, ratings, and hours of operation.",
      "Waze prioritizes active driving support. Its interface is visually bold, with clear alerts for traffic jams, accidents and road hazards submitted by other users. While some may find the screen slightly cluttered, the focus is entirely on driving efficiency, which makes sense given its target audience.",
      "Waze helps to put you on a faster route with live, community-driven alerts that help you dodge traffic jams and road hazards.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Apple Maps offers a minimalist, streamlined interface that emphasizes simplicity. Searching for locations, initiating navigation, and following turn-by-turn instructions is straightforward. The app works seamlessly with iOS features like Siri and CarPlay, providing a smooth and cohesive experience for Apple users.",
      "Navigation accuracy and performance",
      "Accurate routing and timely traffic updates are critical.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0remains the most reliable for precise routing and travel time estimates. It combines AI-enhanced predictive routing with historical and live traffic data to suggest the best route. Its consistency holds strong across urban and rural areas alike.",
      "Waze\u00a0is unmatched for real-time rerouting. Relying heavily on crowd-sourced reports, it often detects slowdowns or hazards before Google Maps does. However, it still struggles when offline or in areas with poor data coverage.",
      "Apple Maps has significantly improved its routing accuracy, especially in cities. Its traffic data is now crowd-sourced from millions of iPhones, processed on-device to protect privacy. In some rural or international regions, though, it can still lag behind Google Maps and Waze.",
      "Apple Maps offers seamless use with your iPhone and CarPlay for smooth and privacy-focused navigation.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Features and ecosystem integration",
      "Beyond basic navigation, each app offers additional tools and integrations.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0offers offline maps, Live View AR navigation, multi-stop routing, EV charger locations and indoor maps for airports and malls. Integration with Gmail, Calendar and Google Assistant creates a seamless travel experience.",
      "Waze\u00a0remains focused on social and driving-specific features. You can report hazards or police sightings and even control Spotify, Audible or podcasts directly from the app without switching screens.",
      "Apple Maps\u00a0leans into privacy and ecosystem benefits. Its \"Look Around\" feature rivals Street View, while EV routing, cycling paths and Siri integration make it ideal for Apple fans. Apple also uses anonymized \"Look Around\" imagery to train its AI models, but with strict privacy safeguards like blurring faces and plates.",
      "YOUR PHONE IS TRACKING YOU EVEN WHEN YOU THINK IT\u2019S NOT",
      "Privacy and data handling",
      "How these apps handle your personal data matters more than ever.",
      "Google Maps\u00a0collects detailed location and usage data to power personalization and advertising. That means better recommendations, but less privacy for users who prefer anonymity.",
      "Waze, also owned by Google, gathers anonymized driving data to enhance community reporting. Its functionality depends on sharing your location in real time, which is necessary for crowd-sourced accuracy.",
      "Apple Maps takes a different approach. It processes most data on-device, uses random identifiers instead of personal accounts and does not associate searches with your Apple ID. That makes it the most privacy-conscious option, though even Apple collects anonymized data for traffic and route improvements.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There is no single \"best\" navigation app, and the right choice depends on your priorities. Google Maps is ideal if you want a feature-packed, versatile app that works well for a variety of transportation modes and travel scenarios. Its global coverage and rich data make it reliable for everyday use and exploration. Waze is best if your main concern is real-time driving efficiency. Its community-driven traffic alerts and dynamic rerouting help you avoid congestion and save time during daily commutes. Apple Maps suits users deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem who value simplicity, clean design and privacy protections. It may not have as many features as Google Maps or the same real-time edge as Waze, but its seamless integration with iOS makes it convenient.",

      "We spend so much time online that how we connect to the internet has become almost as important as the devices we use. Most people never give it a second thought. They connect their computer to Wi-Fi, type in a password and get on with their day. But if you have ever wondered whether plugging in an Ethernet cable is safer than sticking to wireless, you are asking the right question. The way you connect can have real consequences for your privacy and security. Recently, Kathleen reached out to me with the same doubt.",
      "\"Is it more secure to use the Ethernet connection at home for my computer, or is it safer to use the Wi-Fi from my cable provider?\"",
      "It's a great question, Kathleen, because both options seem similar on the surface but work very differently under the hood. Those differences can mean the difference between a private, secure connection and one that's more vulnerable to attackers.",

      "Ethernet offers direct, wired security without wireless risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Ethernet and Wi-Fi differ when it comes to security",
      "Ethernet and Wi-Fi both get you online, but they do it in completely different ways.\u00a0Ethernet\u00a0uses a physical cable that connects your computer directly to the router. Since it is a wired connection, data travels straight through that cable, making it much harder for anyone to intercept it. There is no wireless signal to hijack, no airwaves to eavesdrop on.",
      "Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is built on convenience. It sends your data through the air to and from your router, which is what makes it so easy to connect from anywhere in your home. But that convenience comes with more risk. Anyone within range of your signal could potentially try to break into the network. If your Wi-Fi is protected by a weak password or uses outdated encryption, a skilled attacker might gain access without ever stepping inside your house.",
      "At home, that risk is smaller than in a coffee shop or hotel, but it is not zero. Even a poorly secured smart device on your network can give attackers a way in. Ethernet removes many of those risks simply because it is harder to access a connection that requires physical access to a cable. Check out our steps for setting up a home network like a pro\u00a0here.",
      "DON'T USE YOUR HOME WI-FI BEFORE FIXING CERTAIN SECURITY RISKS",
      "Why one connection might be safer than the other",
      "It is easy to think Ethernet is automatically safer, but that is not the whole story. Your real security depends on how your entire network is set up. For example, a Wi-Fi network with a strong password, up-to-date router firmware, and WPA3 encryption is going to be far more secure than a poorly configured Ethernet setup connected to an outdated router.",
      "There is also the question of who else uses your network. If it is just you and a handful of devices, your risk is low. But if you live in a shared space or run smart home gadgets, that changes the equation. Each device connected to Wi-Fi is a potential entry point. Ethernet reduces the number of devices that can connect, which limits the attack surface.",
      "Ultimately, the connection type is one piece of the puzzle. The bigger factors are how your router is configured, how often you update your software, and how careful you are with what devices you connect.",
      "Wi-Fi brings convenience but also potential exposure to hackers.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "6 ways to make your internet safer",
      "Whether you stick with Wi-Fi or switch to Ethernet, there are several practical steps you can take to protect your devices and data. Each step adds an extra layer of security to your network.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Choose a long and unique password for your Wi-Fi. Avoid obvious choices like your name, address, or simple sequences. A strong password makes it far harder for attackers to guess or crack your network. A password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, reducing the chances of a hacker gaining access through weak or repeated credentials.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords",
      "Most modern routers support WPA3, which is much more secure than older standards like WPA2. Check your router's settings to enable the latest encryption and ensure your network traffic is harder to intercept.",
      "Router manufacturers regularly release updates that patch security vulnerabilities. Log into your router's admin panel occasionally to check for updates and install them as soon as they are available. This prevents attackers from exploiting known flaws.",
      "10 WAYS TO SECURE YOUR OLDER MAC FROM THREATS AND MALWARE",
      "Regularly check which devices are connected to your network and disconnect anything you no longer use. Each connected device is a potential entry point for attackers, so keeping the list limited reduces your network's exposure.",
      "Even on a secure network, malware can sneak in through downloads, phishing attacks, or compromised websites. A strong antivirus program will detect and block malicious activity, protecting your computer before damage occurs.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Ethernet cables connect to a router as part of a home network setup. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "A virtual private network encrypts your internet traffic, making it unreadable to outsiders.

      "So, which is safer, Ethernet or Wi-Fi? Ethernet wins in raw security because it eliminates many of the risks that come with wireless connections.

    "story": [
      "Skydweller CEO Robert Miller discusses his company's solar-powered drone that can fly for days on 'Fox News Live.'",
      "Shoplifting has long been a challenge for retailers, but a U.S. company now believes that flying drones could help combat the issue. Flock Safety, best known for its law enforcement camera systems, is promoting its new Flock Aerodome Drone as an Automated Security system to the private sector. The idea is simple: if a theft occurs, a drone launches, follows the suspect, and streams live video back to security teams or even police. With theft rates reportedly climbing 93% in 2024, the push for high-tech security has never been stronger.",

      "TEXAS COMPANY CREATES DRONES TO CONFRONT SCHOOL SHOOTERS IN SECONDS",
      "Why retailers may be interested",
      "Organized retail crime is a growing problem. Retailers have been reporting higher losses, tighter budgets, and fewer staff members available. Flock Safety argues its drone system can act as a deterrent simply by being visible, making criminals think twice before targeting a store. Beyond retail, the company is also pitching its drones to operators of hospitals, warehouse sites, and energy facilities that require large-scale surveillance.",

      "HEGSETH TEARS UP RED TAPE, ORDERS PENTAGON TO BEGIN DRONE SURGE AT TRUMP'S COMMAND",
      "What this means for you",
      "For shoppers, this could mean visiting stores where drones are part of the security landscape. You might notice them overhead at malls or parking lots, watching for unusual activity. While some may view this as an added safety measure, others may worry about increased surveillance and loss of privacy. For retailers, drones could help protect profits, staff, and customers without the rising costs of hiring additional guards. But whether customers welcome drones buzzing around remains to be seen.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Technology is quickly reshaping how companies approach security, and drones may soon play a bigger role in everyday shopping environments.

To prove possession, they posted samples, including pictures and profiles of ten children, on a darknet website. They then issued a ransom demand, threatening to release more sensitive information unless Kido paid.

      "When questioned about their actions, the group defended their tactics as a form of \"penetration testing\" for which they supposedly deserved compensation.

      "Hackers exploited children\u2019s data in the Kido breach, exposing families to serious risks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

Second, the attackers combined traditional data theft with intimidation tactics, reaching out to parents directly. History suggests that once criminals gain access to such information, the attacks can escalate.",
      "Breaches like this highlight how personal and digital security are intertwined. The potential misuse of data extends beyond simple identity theft.

      "Log in to email, school portals and cloud storage accounts linked to your child. Look for unusual activity such as unrecognized logins, changes to passwords or new connected devices. Set up notifications for account activity whenever possible so you are alerted instantly if something suspicious happens.",
      "Adding\u00a02FA creates an extra layer of security. Even if a hacker has a password, they won't be able to access the account without the second verification step. Most email providers, school portals and messaging platforms support this, and it's a simple step that dramatically improves security.",
      "Data broker sites often collect names, addresses and other personal details that hackers can use. Services that remove your child's information from these databases can make it harder for attackers to find and exploit sensitive data.",

They're chatting through shared Google Docs, buying MacBooks so they can iMessage during class, swapping notes over email, and even sticking to old-school Post-Its to stay in touch. While some of these workarounds seem harmless, they also carry risks, from distractions that take focus away from learning to new opportunities for bullying or even cheating. For teachers, it's a reminder that managing distractions in the classroom goes beyond phone policies.

    "summary": "A scathing new report on the cause of the Titan sub disaster found that the vessel was damaged on earlier dives and built with flawed engineering.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard released underwater video footage of the tail cone and hull remnants of the ill-fated Titan submersible that imploded on its way down to the Titanic in June 2023, killing all five people on board.",
      "A scathing new report into the Titan submersible disaster that killed five people has found the vessel was damaged during earlier dives and built through a flawed engineering process that failed to meet safety standards \u2014 conditions that ultimately led to its fatal implosion.",
      "The report released by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) on Wednesday also found that OceanGate, the vessel's operator, did not adequately test Titan or know its actual strength and durability.",
      "The doomed vessel imploded near the Titanic wreck in the North Atlantic Ocean in 2023, resulting in the instantaneous death of all five occupants.",
      "Unlike earlier probes, the NTSB report focuses on how Titan's carbon-fiber hull physically failed and adds new technical safety recommendations.",

      "General view of the Titan submersible in the Bahamas in May 2018. The Titan imploded during a mission to view the Titanic on Monday, June 19, 2023. (Becky Kagan Schott)",
      "\"We found that the Titan pressure vessel likely sustained damage after it surfaced at the end of dive 80 in the form of one or more delaminations, which weakened the pressure vessel,\" the report states. In plain terms, delamination means that the layers of material started to come apart inside the carbon fiber hull.",
      "Those delaminations deteriorated between dive 80 and dive 88, its final dive, resulting in a local buckling failure that led to the implosion. In fact, it found that after dive 82, the\u00a0Titan\u00a0sustained additional damage of unknown origin that further deteriorated and weakened the pressure vessel.",
      "The new report stated that OceanGate's real-time monitoring data analysis of Titan's pressure was flawed, so the company was unaware that the vessel was damaged and needed to be immediately removed from service. The sensors meant to detect hull strain didn\u2019t trigger proper alarms and engineers misread or dismissed the data, the report found.",
      "The vessel\u2019s flawed engineering and carbon fiber design were outlined as the primary cause for its ultimate demise.",
      "\"We determined that the probable cause of the hull failure and implosion\u2026 was OceanGate\u2019s inadequate engineering process, which failed to establish the actual strength and durability of the Titan pressure vessel and resulted in the company operating a carbon fiber composite vessel that sustained delamination damage\u2026 resulting in a damaged internal structure that subsequently led to a local buckling failure of the pressure vessel,\" the report states.",

      "VIDEO SHOWS OCEANGATE CEO'S WIFE REACT AFTER SOUND NOW THOUGHT TO HAVE BEEN TITAN SUB IMPLOSION",
      "The report also said the wreckage of the Titan likely would have been found sooner had OceanGate followed standard guidance for emergency response, and that would have saved \"time and resources even though a rescue was not possible in this case.\"",
      "The NTSB report follows on from a 335-page report by the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) released in August which found that the tragedy was preventable and also the result of a flawed experimental design and ignored safety warnings.",
      "READ THE FULL REPORT \u2013 APP USERS, CLICK HERE:",
      "That report blamed OceanGate, with particular culpability placed on OceanGate CEO Stockton Rush, who perished in the disaster. It also focused on OceanGate's culture, leadership, certification gaps and suppression of safety warnings.",
      "The new NTSB adds new, sharper specifics that the Coast Guard report didn\u2019t spell out, like how the Titan\u2019s carbon-fiber pressure hull physically failed.",
      "For instance, the Coast Guard only noted that earlier dives showed \"cracking sounds\" and \"signs of fatigue,\" but didn\u2019t tie them to a numbered dive sequence or a confirmed delamination chain.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News chief national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin breaks down President Donald Trump's 'breakthrough' in Gaza on 'The Story.'",
      "As President Donald Trump celebrated the Gaza ceasefire agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, he singled out one leader for extraordinary praise \u2013 Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose leadership he credited for helping deliver the Gaza ceasefire.",
      "\"A guy who\u2019s been a friend of mine for a long time. I don\u2019t know why I like the tough people better than the soft, easy ones,\" Trump said. \"This gentleman from a place called Turkey is one of the most powerful in the world\u2026 He\u2019s a tough cookie \u2014 but he\u2019s my friend.\"",
      "During the war, Erdogan has condemned Israel\u2019s military actions in Gaza while defending Hamas against U.S. policy, and avoided a leading diplomatic role in ending the war.",
      "TRUMP: ERDOGAN COULD BE \u2018INFLUENTIAL\u2019 IN ENDING PUTIN\u2019S WAR BY ENDING OIL SALES \u2018IF HE WANTS\u2019",

      "\"You have to ask yourself what has changed,\" a former senior Israeli intelligence official told Fox News Digital. \"What prompted him, two years later, to return to the arena of power? The most iconic image is him sitting next to Trump at the U.N. \u2014 that\u2019s where the seeds were planted. Why did Trump suddenly seat him by his side? He was likely told, \u2018He\u2019s the one who can bring us Hamas.\u2019\"",
      "Trump\u2019s public praise underscored a new level of trust between Washington and Ankara. But according to Turkish press reports, Erdogan refused to land his plane in Egypt after learning that Netanyahu \u2014 personally invited by Trump \u2014 might attend the summit. The Turkish president only agreed to land once it was confirmed that the Israeli leader would not be present.",
      "\"It was classic Erdogan theater,\" said Sinan Ciddi, senior fellow and director of the Turkey Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \"He likely knew Netanyahu was expected, especially because the U.S. president was there. But refusing to land until Netanyahu was out gives him domestic political capital and boosts his image across parts of the Muslim world.\"",
      "Ciddi also recalled a moment he said was telling about Erdogan\u2019s public posture. He referred to an appearance on Fox News where Erdogan stated, \"I don\u2019t consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization, but a resistance movement,\" adding that he made the remark on American cable television, on American soil, \"without facing repercussions.\"",

      "Ciddi said Erdogan\u2019s ambitions now go far beyond diplomacy. \"He wants Turkish construction companies to rebuild Gaza, Turkish troops to take part in any enforcement mission, and Turkey to serve as guarantor for the Palestinians,\" he said. \"That would give Ankara both economic and political leverage \u2014 contracts for its companies, troops on the ground, and a seat at every table discussing Gaza\u2019s future.\"",
      "But Ciddi also explains Turkey\u2019s ambitions in Gaza are part of a wider strategic calculus. \"Trump\u2019s demands from Erdogan regarding the F-35 were not just predicated on Gaza,\" he said. \"They included ending Turkey\u2019s energy dependence on Russia, addressing the S-400 missile issue, and playing a constructive role in stabilizing Gaza.\"",
      "He added that Erdogan has so far resisted parts of that package, \"But by helping Trump deliver a ceasefire, Erdogan is trying to rebuild trust with Washington \u2014 and prove that Turkey can once again be a useful NATO partner.\"",
      "Avner Golov, vice president of Mind Israel think tank, told Fox News Digital that \"From Israel\u2019s perspective, an Iranian land bridge from Tehran westward through Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Israel must not exist. Iran remains the biggest challenge,\" Golov said. \"But into that vacuum we now see the Muslim Brotherhood axis led by Turkey and Qatar.

      "Golov, who previously served as a senior director at Israel\u2019s National Security Council, added that Washington\u2019s early effort to center the post-war framework on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has faded. \"In the current deal, the big winners are not the UAE and Saudi Arabia, which would have served Israel\u2019s interests, but Turkey and Qatar,\" he said. \"Before the deal, Erdogan was already a major player, and yesterday he used a veto \u2014 Trump invited, and Erdogan vetoed. Those who didn\u2019t want Erdogan on the Syrian Golan Heights will get him in Gaza.\"",
      "He said Israel and the U.S. should counterbalance Ankara\u2019s rise by re-energizing cooperation with the Gulf. \"Israel has what Qatar and Turkey don\u2019t \u2014 technology and credibility,\" Golov said. \"If Israel links its innovation with Gulf energy and resources, it can build a regional hub that strengthens the pro-American camp and weakens both the Muslim Brotherhood and Iran.\"",

      "Ciddi remains skeptical that Israel will accept any Turkish uniformed presence. \"In Israel\u2019s eyes, Turkish forces in Gaza would be a pathway to re-legitimizing Hamas,\" he said. \"That\u2019s a hard line.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Oct 2025 17:16:30 GMT",
    "summary": "After 1,300 CDC employees were laid off week, around half of those terminations were rescinded. Then a judge blocked the Trump administration's shutdown cuts.",
    "story": [
      "After a week of chaos and confusion, as Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees described it, the fates of more than 600 workers hang in the balance now that a federal judge has temporarily blocked their terminations.",
      "The saga began on Friday, when around 1,300 employees at the CDC were told they had been let go. Less than a day later, around 700 of them were told that they had received the notices in error. The rest seemed to be out of a job until Wednesday, when the judge ordered the Trump administration not to fire any additional workers during the government shutdown, and not to enforce the terminations carried out since last week.",
      "All this has played out while many CDC employees remain furloughed.",
      "The Trump administration did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment on the ruling, which came in response to a lawsuit filed by two labor unions representing federal employees. A hearing is scheduled for later this month.",
      "The more than 600 CDC employees whose firings were not rescinded include some staffers who managed the agency\u2019s chronic disease programs \u2014 a research area Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to prioritize \u2014 as well as others who worked on a key survey measuring the health and nutrition of the U.S. population, according to a union representing CDC workers, an advocacy group of former agency staffers, and several current and former employees familiar with the matter. The group also includes some mental health professionals within the agency who had supported staff after the August shooting at CDC headquarters.",
      "The layoffs happened \u201cacross the board, across multiple programs, particularly in communication, policy and operations,\u201d said a spokesperson for the union, American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883.",
      "The Trump administration tied the firings to the shutdown.",
      "\u201cCertain HHS employees received reduction-in-force notices as a direct consequence of the Democrat-led government shutdown,\u201d Department of Health and Human Services spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement ahead of the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cHHS under the Biden administration became a bloated bureaucracy, growing its budget by 38% and its workforce by 17%. All HHS employees receiving reduction-in-force notices were designated non-essential by their respective divisions,\u201d he said.",
      "Nixon disputed reports from the union and former CDC employees that some staffers working on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey had been fired. He said HHS had rescinded those terminations.",
      "The cuts came as Kennedy continues to reshape HHS. As health secretary, he has fired the CDC director \u2014 just 29 days after the Senate confirmed her \u2014 halted work on mRNA vaccines and moved to drastically downsize and restructure his department\u2019s agencies.",
      "Friday\u2019s layoffs (the ones not rescinded) hit some CDC workers who helped handle requests from states to investigate urgent public health problems, such as overdose and drowning deaths, according to an agency employee familiar with the matter.",
      "Also fired was much of the agency\u2019s human resources staff; its entire Washington office, which communicates with Congress; and its ethics office, which reviews conflicts of interest for CDC leaders and advisory committee members.",
      "Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, who resigned in August as director of the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said losing the ethics office means reduced oversight over the agency\u2019s vaccine advisory panel. Kennedy fired the panel\u2019s previous members in June and appointed new ones, many of whom have expressed skepticism about Covid vaccines.",
      "\u201cI, as now an external person to CDC, have concerns that these folks have baseline conflicts of interest,\u201d Daskalakis said Wednesday on a press call hosted by Defend America Action, a nonprofit that opposes the Trump administration\u2019s policies. \u201cWe\u2019ll never know because they\u2019re not going to be assessed anymore by the ethics office. So that\u2019s another pretty significant red flag.\u201d",
      "The CDC bore a large share of the \u201creductions in force\u201d that the Trump administration announced on Friday, when more than 4,000 federal workers were let go across seven departments. More than half were in HHS and the Treasury Department, according to a court filing.",
      "Yolanda Jacobs, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 2883, said human resource workers who had been furloughed due to the shutdown were brought back for the purpose of sending out termination notices on Friday, including to themselves.",
      "\u201cFor nearly a year now, our members have been bullied. They\u2019ve been tormented. They\u2019ve been left in a constant state of panic about job security,\u201d Jacobs said.",
      "Vice President JD Vance told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that the layoffs were needed to help preserve other essential benefits for Americans.",
      "Democrats, however, have said the shutdown does not necessitate that federal workers be fired or give the administration new powers to enact such cuts.",
      "Although Nixon said a \u201csystem glitch\u201d was to blame for the termination notices that were sent, then later rescinded, some current and former CDC staffers questioned that explanation and suggested that the latest cuts were part of a larger pattern of reckless, illegal firings.",
      "\u201cIt seemed like intentional chaos for the sake of chaos so that nobody knew what was going on,\u201d said an employee who declined to be named for fear of retribution.",
      "CDC staff who got termination notices described mass confusion over which programs were targeted, with one worker saying they had to piece together the puzzle through Reddit forums and text messages.",
      "\u201cThese terminations were not a glitch. It was not an innocent error made. This round of firings, as with all the others experienced at CDC in the last 10 months, was an intentional attack on the American people and the public\u2019s health,\u201d Abigail Tighe, a former CDC employee who was fired in an earlier round of layoffs, said Tuesday on a press call. Tighe is now the executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy group of former CDC staffers.",
      "Since Trump took office in January, the CDC has undergone three rounds of layoffs. A union spokesperson said the agency has lost 24% of its total workforce \u2014 a little over 3,000  employees \u2014 since January due to terminations, retirements or people accepting buyout offers.",
      "Aryn Melton Backus, a former employee in the CDC\u2019s Office on Smoking and Health, said she has received three termination letters from the agency so far this year. Her first came during the Trump administration\u2019s firing of probationary employees in February, she said, followed by a second in April when HHS massively downsized the CDC.",
      "Backus said she is still on administrative leave due to a court case challenging the legality of the firings. However, on Friday, her team received another round of termination notices, which were ultimately rescinded, she said.",
      "\u201cWe are doing important work to help prevent smoking, help smokers quit and monitor emerging tobacco products,\u201d Backus said. \u201cNow that work has been abruptly stopped.\u201d",
      "Other employees who were initially terminated last week then brought back include staffers focused on suicide prevention and responses to Ebola and measles outbreaks, according to the National Public Health Coalition.",
      "Morale at the agency remains very low.",
      "\u201cMy office had two bullet holes in it,\u201d said Katie Fullerton, who spent 15 years doing infectious disease surveillance at the CDC before she resigned in August, soon after a gunman opened fire on the agency\u2019s headquarters.",
      "\u201cThat, combined with all of the thousands of paper cuts that we\u2019ve received from this administration, I decided I did not have five more years in me,\u201d she added. Leaving before her 20-year mark means Fullerton won\u2019t qualify for federal health benefits."

      "Witherspoon, who runs her own book club and has served as executive producer of many book-to-screen adaptations, collaborated with bestselling thriller author Harlan Coben to write the novel \"Gone Before Goodbye,\" out Oct. 14.",
      "Witherspoon tells TODAY.com she came out of the experience with \"more respect for writers.\"",
      "\"It's just an incredibly disciplined talent where they have to really make stuff up out of thin air,\" Witherspoon says.",
      "Coben, standing next to her, says he's not sure where his ability to write his many twists comes from. \"I think if I think about it, it'll go away,\" he says, laughing.",
      "\"Gone Before Goodbye\" began with an idea Witherspoon had about three years ago, but felt she couldn't execute on her own. She called up Coben, whom she had met about two and half years before, to help tell the story of Maggie McCabe, a former army combat surgeon who finds herself entangled with billionaire oligarchs, dark money and a dangerous scheme.",
      "Growing up the daughter of a surgeon and nurse, Witherspoon was fascinated by the medical profession and said at her Shine Away in October that she once dreamed of entering the field, per the Hollywood Reporter.",

      "Witherspoon, meanwhile, says it was \"privilege\" to watch him construct the book.",
      "\"I understood a lot as an actor about building character, but he builds entire worlds and a cast of characters that all have to intertwine to come out with this perfect result. And he managed to tie up every loose end, which I didn't think was possible,\" she says.",
      "But when it came to landing the ending, Coben credits Witherspoon's suggestion to change it.",
      "\"When she first told me, (I) was kind of like, 'No one touches my endings.' But actually she was right. I went to bed that night, I woke up the next morning, said, 'You're right.' So we made a little change in the end,\" he says.",
      "The duo played coy when asked on TODAY with Jenna & Friends whether they'd ever team up for an adaptation.",

      "\"Only with Harlan Coben,\" she says."

      "Over 27,000 posts and counting have used the hashtag #girlwhatever. The videos take on a similar format: Users post videos of themselves or their surroundings set to Charli XCX\u2019s song \u201cYou (Ha Ha Ha).\u201d",
      "The wide application of the \"girl whatever\" trend include: Horses running by a pool, footage from a Lady Gaga concert, a skydiving expedition, or eating a burrito on a beach. It's even reached the NFL: The Pittsburgh Steelers, Kansas City Chiefs and New York Giants have tapped into the trend, posting videos of their players running onto the field.",

      "Other TikTokers have come to the rescue with takes.",
      "The social media agency @media.alacarte, which explains TikTok trends in videos, said you can \u201cuse this iconic Charli XCX song to show how you are loving life, despite everything going on around you. Because let\u2019s be honest..it was never *that* serious.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe \u2018girl whatever\u2019 trend is all about loving yourself and embracing your main character energy,\u201d creator Melanie Martinez said in a video.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s also about leaving the drama and haters behind because the trivial problems and stress that they carry just have no place in your life,\u201d she added.",
      "TikToker Lizzy Lucamai offered another take on what the trend \u201creally means.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt means escaping the ordinary and realizing that you were meant for something more,\u201d Lucamai wrote. \u201cIt means nurturing your wild woman spirit and chasing down your dream. It means leaving behind everything that is not meant for you, clearing space for the things that are.\u201d",
      "The phrase is \u201cnot a diss,\u201d as commenters on this post from an Olivia Rodrigo concert (which got nearly 11 million views) were quick to point out. \u201cTo the people who dont understand: the girl whatever trend goes over a video of you happy living your best lifeee (sic), this is not a diss,\u201d one comment read.",
      "Like the slang term 67, \u201cgirl whatever\u201d doesn\u2019t really mean anything too deep. It's more an attitude and a mindset \u2014 enjoying your life as it passes you by."

      "A dispute between a high-end bakery and an online food reviewer has a mess of crumbs all over TikTok.",
      "On Oct. 7, Aurora Griffo, who posted food videos under the name \u201cGlamorama\u201d on TikTok, shared a now-deleted review of Arizona bakery JL Patisserie that sparked major backlash and, eventually, an apology.",
      "\u201cI do not mind spending 10 dollars on a pastry if they are really good, but you cannot use fake-ass ingredients,\u201d Griffo said in the controversial review, while holding a pistachio croissant. \u201cThat pistachio color is about as natural as my boobs, ass and waistline.\u201d",
      "She was similarly harsh regarding the shop\u2019s coffee, which she deemed \u201csuper sour and acidic,\u201d and its quiche, which she said had a \u201cpaper-thin\u201d crust and so much egg, she \u201cwould have eaten an omelet\u201d instead.",
      "\u201cFive dollars for a canel\u00e9? I didn\u2019t even pay that in San Tro-f---ing-pez,\u201d she continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the price next to the Phoenix Airport? OK.\u201d",
      "\u201cI absolutely loved the pumpkin pie croissant, but everything was a little on the sweet and rich side, which some people love,\u201d she added. \u201cPersonally, I like my sweets a little less sweet, so I\u2019d rather get treated like s--- and go to Paris again.\u201d",
      "Griffo ended her review with this missive: \u201cWith all of that being said, I think if you stay away from the expensive ingredients, like deez nuts, you can definitely enjoy delicious, rich pastry here.\u201d",
      "The Bakery Owner\u2019s Response Goes Viral",
      "Though the review itself didn\u2019t initially go viral, it caught the attention of the bakery, which is owned by Jenna Leurquin. On Oct. 9, she responded in a now-viral video, disputing most of Griffo\u2019s claims, without naming her directly.",
      "\u201cSo, we recently had an influencer reach out to us and asked to do a collaboration, and we respectfully declined, because it was not in our budget right now,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThen, she essentially tried to blackmail us by saying if we offered the food for free, she would then write a good review about us.\u201d",
      "Along with the claim, Leurquin posted a screenshot of a direct message from Griffo in which she said the \u201cmeal will need to be comped including the gratuity\u201d for a collaboration, but that if the bakery accepts, her \u201chonest review\u201d would \u201chighlight/focus on what l enjoyed and be softer/quicker on my words with what I may not like as much.\u201d",
      "Leurquin said she would consider it, but before she\u2019d made up her mind, Griffo came in the next day. The staff recognized her when she came in and were \u201cvery accommodating\u201d and \u201ctotally respected that review,\u201d said Leurquin.",
      "\u201cBut what we don\u2019t like is lying and bullying,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "For the remainder of the video, she pushes back on the accusation that the bakery\u2019s ingredients are fake: They use PreGel pistachio paste, which is \u201cmade from the finest pistachios,\u201d Panettone flour from Italy, and other imported ingredients. \u201cNot bad for a \u2018close to the airport bakery,\u201d Leurquin said.",
      "Aafter showing some of the bakery\u2019s preparation processes and noting everything is made from scratch, Leurquin ends the video with a message to all influencers.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me. This specific influencer has gone to many different local restaurants and bullied them,\u201d Leurquin said. \u201cThe problem is if the next generation is influenced by her to believe it\u2019s OK to bully and disrespect the food industry.\u201d",
      "Griffo did not immediately respond to TODAY.com\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Leurquin\u2019s response garnered a staggering 60 million views and nearly 50,000 comments.",
      "\u201cI am loving this new trend of restaurants getting publicity for outing these influencers, blackmailing businesses for a pastry,\u201d commented one TikTok user.",
      "Referring to Griffo\u2019s review, someone else said, \u201cThat was straight bullying just because she couldn\u2019t get free food.\u201d",
      "Even mega-popular food reviewer Keith Lee weighed in on the drama.",
      "\u201cWhat you do with a little is what you do with a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you say you\u2019re gonna be honest now, and you not honest, you ain\u2019t gonna be honest when you get 100 million followers, that\u2019s the way I feel.\u201d",
      "Glamorama Responds, Then Apologizes",
      "Griffo posted a response to Leurquin, saying it was a \u201cbit of a stretch\u201d that she was bullying the bakery, since it has more followers than she does, but later deleted the video.",
      "\u201cGoddamn, someone finally stood up to me. You know, I gotta say f---ing kudos for real,\u201d Griffo said. \u201cI never said that I would leave a good review for a free meal.\u201d",
      "That video didn\u2019t go over well, either: After even more backlash, Griffo deleted all of her videos, changed her username and posted an apology.",
      "\u201cMy review was not revenge for being turned down for a collaboration I had already planned to visit and review the bakery regardless, paid or not,\u201d Griffo wrote in the text-based TikTok. \u201cBut I understand with how things unfolded, it might have looked like I did it out of spite. That\u2019s not who l am, and that was never my intention.\u201d",
      "Griffo said she gives honest reviews and the folks who have followed her \u201cfor a while\u201d know that, but understands now that \u201chonesty without compassion can come across the wrong way.\u201d",
      "\u201cTo the bakery, I\u2019m sincerely sorry for any harm my words may have caused. I respect the time, effort, and heart that goes into running a small business, and I genuinely wish you nothing but success moving forward,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re all human. Sometimes we mess up publicly and all we can do is take accountability, learn, and grow from it.\u201d",
      "The Bakery Owner Speaks Out",
      "Leurquin says since her video went viral, it\u2019s \u201cthe busiest we\u2019ve ever been,\u201d Leurquin tells TODAY.com. \u201cAnd primarily, people have just been so nice.\u201d",
      "The baker says that people have been opting for the pistachio croissant most, of course, followed by the pumpkin croissant, an item that was on special last weekend.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very proud of my community. I\u2019m very proud that I stood up for what we do, and my team, and I think the truth spoke for itself, and the way people stood up really, truly amazed me,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I could have ever imagined to see this in my life, truly, and I feel so blessed and amazed that people are supporting us the way they are, and people have been so nice, so patient this weekend. It\u2019s mind blowing.\u201d",
      "Leurquin also says some of the harsher backlash Griffo is receiving is not what she wishes on her.",
      "\u201cI know she is getting some death threats and stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s getting very intense on her side but in a negative way. That\u2019s something that we never meant to have happen.\u201d"

It was a big part of our lives,\" Kardashian said. \"My kids, I say such positive things about their dad that, like, North had to say to me, 'Mom, I think you go upstairs and, like, cry at night. Like, it\u2019s OK. It\u2019s time to move on. You need to have a boyfriend now.' And I\u2019m like, 'Wait, what? What? I cry? No, I'm getting a massage upstairs. What do you think is happening?'\"",

And I\u2019d be like, 'Oh, wait, where\u2019s all our cars? My new car.' And it would be like, 'Oh, he gave them away to all of his friends.'\"",

I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself,\u201d Spears wrote. \u201cThe conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child.

      "The newest season of Netflix's \"Monster\" not only depicts killer Ed Gein and his macabre crimes, it also shows him with a female companion whose role in his life has been disputed.",
      "Charlie Hunnam plays the man who became known as The Butcher of Plainfield for the grisly crimes uncovered at his Wisconsin farm in 1957. Gein admitted to killing two local women and robbing graves at a local cemetery to make ghoulish items like bowls, lampshades and upholstered chairs out of human skin and bone.",
      "In \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story,\" actor Suzanna Son plays a woman named Adeline Watkins, who appears to be Gein\u2019s girlfriend and a woman who shares some of his interest in gruesome murders.",
      "Was she a real person? Here's what to know.",
      "Who Was Adeline Watkins?",
      "Following Gein's arrest in 1957, a local woman from Gein's hometown of Plainfield named Adeline Watkins gave an interview with the Minneapolis Tribune, which was reprinted in the Wisconsin State Journal on Nov. 21, 1957, saying Gein once proposed to her.",
      "Watkins, who was 50 years old at the time, described Gein as \"good and kind and sweet\" in the article.",
      "She claimed the two had a 20-year romance and that Gein \"was so nice about doing things I wanted to do that sometimes I felt I was taking advantage of him.\"",
      "\"I loved him and I still do,\" she added.",
      "She was described by the reporter as \"a plain woman with graying bangs and horn-rimmed glasses.\"",
      "Watkins said her last date with Gein was on Feb. 6, 1955, about two years before he was arrested. She claimed that Gein didn't explicitly propose to her that night, but she \"knew what he meant.\"",
      "\"I turned him down, but not because there was anything wrong with him,\" she continued. \"It was something wrong with me. I guess I was afraid I wouldn't be able to live up to what he expected of me.\"",
      "Watkins' mother was also quoted saying Gein was a \"sweet, polite man\" who always had her daughter home by 10 p.m. from a date.",
      "Watkins added that she and Gein often talked about books, including his favorites about lions, tigers, Africa and India. She said they also loved true crime.",
      "\"I guess we discussed every murder we ever heard about,\" she said. \"Eddie told how the murdered did wrong, what mistakes he had made. I thought it was interesting.\"",
      "What Did Ed Gein Say About His Relationship with Adeline Watkins?",
      "Gein never publicly made any mention of Watkins.",
      "In the book \"Unhinged\" by Robert Keller, Gein was described as a \"lonely old bachelor\" whom local farmers' wives took pity on and delivered meals and cookies to him at his farm.",
      "Watkins said in the Minneapolis Tribune that she and Gein went on dates to the movies or a local tavern. She said she had to \"drag\" Gein into a tavern because he did not drink.",
      "However, one of the women Gein admitted to murdering was a tavern owner, Mary Hogan. He frequently visited her establishment and looked at her as a \"mirror image of his sainted mother,\" according to \"Unhinged.\" It's unclear whether Watkins and Gein ever visited Hogan's tavern or if they were ever truly a couple.",
      "Following his arrest, Gein lived in state psychiatric facilities until his death in 1984.",
      "While growing up under their mother's domineering presence, Gein and his brother were warned constantly by their mother about the immorality of women and told to avoid them. Neither of them ever married, and Ed Gein remained obsessed with his mother until her death and beyond.",
      "Adeline Watkins Retracted Her Statements",
      "Watkins' interview with the Minnesota paper was picked up by The Associated Press and made national headlines for her alleged love affair with a ghoulish murderer and grave robber.",
      "She then spoke to the local Stevens Point Journal in Wisconsin for a story that ran on Dec. 3, 1957, and denied some of her previous statements.",
      "Watkins said there was no 20-year romance between the two, only that she had known him for 20 years. She said she had only spent time with him during a seven-month period in 1954 and went to a few shows at a local theater and spent time with him at her home. She said she never visited his home.",
      "She denied that she or her mother had referred to Gein as \"sweet\" in the interview. She also denied saying she had to \"practically drag\" Gein into a local tavern.",
      "Outside of the two newspaper stories, Watkins did not speak publicly about Gein again. She died at 85 in 1992 and was buried in the Plainfield Cemetery in Wisconsin. It's one of the cemeteries where Gein admitted to digging up corpses in the 1940s and '50s.",
      "How is Adeline Watkins Portrayed in 'Monster'?",
      "Son portrays Watkins as Gein's girlfriend in the Netflix series. It also shows her as complicit in his crimes. There is no evidence of that ever happening.",
      "Son's character shows him photos of Holocaust victims and notorious Nazi war criminal Ilse Koch, and then Gein shows her the hair-raising items he made out of human body parts. She is shown a bowl made of a skull, a belt made out of women's nipples and a chair upholstered with human skin, all of which were real items found by authorities at Gein's home in Plainfield, Wisconsin.",
      "He also introduces Son's character to his \"mother,\" which is really a corpse of his late mother sitting in a chair with her back to Watkins like a scene straight out of \"Psycho,\" which was inspired by Gein's crimes. Adeline then promptly leaves.",
      "Gein denied digging up the body of his mother, Augusta Gein, who died of a stroke in 1945.",
      "In a later episode, the two are seen at a graveyard, where Watkins accepts a wedding proposal from Gein. She is then shown wanting to have sex with him, but he stops her because he's been taught by his mother that sex is only for procreation.",
      "The two are then shown moving in together, and Watkins is depicted as having a morbid fascination when she finds the corpse of one of Gein's victims. Yet another disturbing scene shows Watkins photographing corpses mutilated by Gein and encouraging necrophilia.",
      "None of these events appear to have happened, according to police reports, interviews with Gein and the interviews with Watkins.",
      "In perhaps a nod to the Minneapolis Tribune interview by Watkins, Son's character is later shown seeking media attention to grab the spotlight after Gein's crimes have been made public. In the final episode, she meets with Gein in his psychiatric hospital and confesses to disturbing urges.",
      "Neither Gein nor Watkins ever spoke of any meeting between them while Gein was in the hospital."

      "\u201cDiane was really important. She was one of my first mentors in this business. I was 15 years old and I was from Nashville, Tennessee, and I didn\u2019t know anybody,\u201d an emotional Witherspoon said, while noting it was either her second or third audition ever for a movie.",

      "Viewers had to wait until the end of the Season 8 premiere to learn what happened to Isobel. Per TV Insider, Jubal contacted Isobel\u2019s husband Philip (Tom Cavanagh) to tell him that she had to undergo an emergency craniotomy due to a brain bleed. Luckily, Isobel made it through.",
      "The episode also put two other characters \u2014 Maggie (Missy Peregrym) and OA (Zeeko Zaki) \u2014 at risk when they traveled to an island while working on a case. When the two were held hostage, Scola (John Boyd) and Dani (Emily Alabi) went to save them.",

What happens if it shifts slightly?\u2019 Isobel holds the entire team together in a lot of ways.

      "\u201cHow does the team react when they lose that center of gravity? Who steps in to fill the void? And of course, we\u2019re thrilled to be welcoming her back to 26 Fed, when she\u2019s ready,\u201d Weiss said.",
      "Looking ahead, Weiss said Isobel will find herself in a transitional period after almost dying.",
      "\u201cIsobel is the steady heart and soul of the 26 Fed office. This near-death experience weighs on her in the background but never deters her drive to lead our FBI team and keep New Yorkers safe. It\u2019s that quiet strength that everyone admires about her,\u201d he said.",
      "As for Dani\u2019s death, the tragedy will definitely impact Scola, her partner.",
      "\u201cLosing a partner is always a tough thing. And Scola is going to be feeling the loss of Dani for a while. But Scola joined the FBI after the loss of his brother. He\u2019s a character who finds ways to grow and honor everyone he\u2019s lost in his daily life as an agent. It\u2019s what makes him an extraordinary asset to the team,\u201d Weiss said."

That\u2019s the only way, selfish or not,  whatever that is, I\u2019ve wanted it.\u201d",

But I\u2019m not in pursuit of motherhood because I feel incomplete in some way, as our celebrity news culture would lead us all to believe.\u201d",
      "In 2022, Aniston told Allure that in earlier years, she did IVF to have a baby.",
      "\u201cI was trying to get pregnant. It was a challenging road for me, the baby-making road,\u201d Aniston told the outlet.",

It does affect me \u2014 I\u2019m just a human being. We\u2019re all human beings. That\u2019s why I thought, \u2018What the hell?\u2019\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 10 Oct 2025 01:19:24 GMT",
    "summary": "President Donald Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s personal touch \u2014 both as a heavy hand and a gentle guide \u2014 played a pivotal role at key moments in the development of a Middle East peace deal that promises to bring an end to Israel\u2019s two-year war in Gaza, current and former officials in the United States and other nations told NBC News.",
      "Trump announced on Wednesday that the \u201cfirst phase\u201d of the plan to end the conflict in Gaza had been agreed to, with a pause in fighting and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Trump called it \u201ca great deal\u201d in a brief interview with NBC News on Thursday morning. \u201cEverybody is happy,\u201d he said.",
      "The deal accelerated over several crucial moments \u2014 Israel\u2019s strike on Qatar, discussions on the sidelines of the recent United Nations General Assembly in New York City and Jared Kushner\u2019s conversations with his father-in-law, these sources said.",
      "Also helpful, though, was an old-fashioned deadline. In recent weeks, Trump told advisers he wanted to announce a deal by Oct. 7, the second anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack on Israel that precipitated the war, according to two people familiar with his instructions.",
      "The president, one of the people said, was fixated on the date both for its symbolic significance and because he saw it as a way to herald a new step forward in Israel\u2019s relationship with Saudi Arabia when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman visits Washington next month.",
      "This account of the Trump administration\u2019s role in the ceasefire deal is based on interviews with a dozen sources in three countries.",
      "As the war in Gaza ground on \u2014 with more than 67,000 dead, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, declarations of famine and images of wounded children across social media \u2014 it threatened Trump\u2019s vision for a more interconnected Middle East that he began to implement in his first term with the Abraham Accords, which established relationships between Israel and several Arab nations.",
      "The war\u2019s intensity also presented an opportunity for Trump to coalesce regional powers around a peace plan to disarm Hamas, preclude Israel from seizing the West Bank and provide for the redevelopment of Gaza.",
      "Israel and Hamas agreed Wednesday to the first phase of that proposal \u2014 a ceasefire and an Israeli military pullback to a \u201cyellow line\u201d within Gaza that leaves more of the strip under the control of Palestinians. That is to be followed by Hamas\u2019 returning as many as 20 Israeli hostages and the remains of as many as 28 hostages and Israel\u2019s releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the remains of 15 dead Gazans.",
      "Trump was able to announce the pact just one day after his target.",
      "To do that, Trump had to maintain the trust of Israel and of a series of Arab- and Muslim-majority nations that could influence Hamas and Palestinian civilians. At the same time, he had to apply pressure. His ability to walk that tightrope was tested repeatedly.",
      "And, at times, the darkest hours yielded the biggest breakthroughs.",
      "Qatar strikes",
      "After months of negotiations with no result, a turning point came in September in the form of a surprise attack.",
      "Israeli forces launched airstrikes on the Qatari capital, Doha, in an attempt to kill the leaders of Hamas. Six people were killed, including a member of Qatar\u2019s internal security force.",
      "Over the course of the war, Israel has struck in Iran, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, in addition to Gaza.",
      "But this was different. Qatar is a U.S. ally that hosts a strategic air base with 10,000 American troops. Trump and his team had come to view the Persian Gulf nation as a trusted partner in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. The parents of an Israeli hostage had been in Doha that very morning, meeting Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani.",
      "The bombing blindsided and angered the White House, as well as the Arab world.",
      "Asked about the strikes at the time, Trump told reporters: \u201cI was very unhappy about it. Very unhappy about every aspect.\u201d",
      "But instead of killing the prospect of a deal, the Israeli attack prompted Trump and his team to ratchet up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to bring the war to an end.",
      "\u201cIt was the moment that Trump said, \u2018Enough,\u2019\u201d said a former Israeli official, adding: \u201cThis deal, almost identical, has been on the table for over a year now. Netanyahu didn\u2019t want to do it, but Trump left him no choice.\u201d",
      "\u201cBoth Netanyahu and Hamas tried to say \u2018yes, but\u2019 to stall, but Trump decided to hear only \u2018yes\u2019 and pushed them into the corner,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Shortly after the strikes, Trump issued a warning to Israel: He would not support the annexation of the West Bank, as some far-right members of Netanyahu\u2019s Cabinet had proposed.",
      "The Americans, the Qataris and other Arab governments saw the surprise strikes as an opportunity to exert leverage, according to an Arab official and former Israeli officials with knowledge of the diplomatic talks.",
      "\u201cIt was a catalyst to bring pressure on the Israeli government, which had been the main obstacle to a deal,\u201d the Arab official said.",
      "U.N. General Assembly sidelines",
      "Weeks after the strikes on Doha, the U.N. General Assembly met along the bank of the East River in New York City.",
      "It was on the sidelines \u2014 where, historically, deals are often solidified with face-to-face interactions and handshakes \u2014 that the discussions \u201creally took a turn,\u201d Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.",
      "Trump convened a meeting at the General Assembly with Arab- and Muslim-majority nations to sell his 20-point peace plan. Rubio said that is where Trump \u201ccreated this coalition\u201d before he presented the proposal to Netanyahu at the White House at the end of last month.",
      "Crucially, during that visit, Trump persuaded Netanyahu to call Al-Thani, the Qatari prime minister, to apologize for the Israeli strikes in Qatar. That allowed Qatar to remain engaged as a key intermediary in peace talks.",
      "\u201cIt is my understanding that the Qatari government viewed the apology as a way to move forward, and it saw its role, that it had invested in for quite a long time, as still vital to achieving a ceasefire and hopefully peace in the future,\u201d Nawaf Al-Thani, a former Qatari defense attach\u00e9 to the United States, told NBC News.",
      "Trump\u2019s handling of that episode was reminiscent for many observers of the way he reacted to Israel\u2019s and Iran\u2019s striking each other during a ceasefire agreement following American bombing raids on Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "\u201cWe basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don\u2019t know what the f--- they\u2019re doing,\u201d Trump, clearly frustrated, said at the time. His rebuke of Israel, along with Iran, reassured Arab countries with ties to Shia-majority Iran. In that way, a former senior White House official said, Trump\u2019s messages to Israel after its strikes in Iran and in Qatar were similar.",
      "\u201cBoth showed the president\u2019s commitment to Israel, but also his commitment to the Arab countries,\u201d the former official said.",
      "Seeing the United States pushing Israel over the strike in Doha helped persuade Qatar, Turkey and other Arab governments to press Hamas, making it clear that the time for delays and foot-dragging was over, the officials said.",
      "As the negotiations advanced, both the U.S. and Arab negotiators chose to convey a united and optimistic front, placing Netanyahu at risk of potentially insulting Trump if he questioned the 20-point proposal Trump put on the table, the former Israeli official said.",
      "\u201cThe Trump people and Arab world just briefed total confidence and optimism before anything was finalized to make it seem like a done deal, which made saying \u2018no\u2019 a public affront to Trump, and Netanyahu can\u2019t do that,\u201d the former official said. \u201cIt was a show of very effective statecraft and use of leverage.\u201d",
      "Kushner\u2019s role",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term, Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law, became his chief envoy to the Middle East. There he was delivering a speech at the opening of the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. There he was building relationships with Arab leaders, focusing on economic relations.",
      "Years later, Kushner became deeply involved in the negotiations between Israel and Hamas. He emerged, former Israeli officials said, because he carries important influence with regional governments and the president.",
      "\u201cKushner was the architect,\u201d a former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner was able to convey to Trump that the conflict in Gaza threatened the future of his biggest diplomatic success the last time he was in office \u2014 the Abraham Accords.",
      "That deal produced peace agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Morocco. Trump has aimed to extend it to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel.",
      "\u201cThe entire legacy was in jeopardy,\u201d the former Israeli official said.",
      "Kushner and Trump\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, traveled to Egypt on Tuesday to hammer out details of the deal, according to senior U.S. officials.",
      "They went over various aspects of the proposal, including how Israeli military forces would be redeployed and the order of hostage and prisoner releases, the officials said, with one adding that an important feature of their work was the decision to \u201cseparate the peace deal into two clear phases.\u201d That allowed for an agreement on the exchange of people, while the deal\u2019s other points are negotiated in a second phase.",
      "The U.S. negotiators called Trump on Wednesday evening to get his final guidance before he announced that a deal was in place, the officials said. Israel\u2019s government approved the exchange Thursday evening.",
      "\u201cIt came together quick in a good way,\u201d Witkoff told NBC News in a brief telephone interview Thursday morning as he waited to board a flight to Israel.",
      "Kushner and Witkoff had about \u201cfive hours of sleep in the last three days,\u201d senior U.S. officials said.",
      "American negotiators expect the next phase to be \u201calmost a permanent ceasefire until all the other issues we have to deal with are negotiated and considered,\u201d one of the officials said, pointing to outstanding topics as thorny as how Gaza will be governed.",
      "U.S. officials cautioned Thursday that there is still a lot of work to do to ensure the ceasefire holds and the rest of the plans can be finalized and implemented.",
      "\u201cThis is a very delicate time,\u201d one of them said.",
      "Trump said he plans to travel to Egypt to put his signature on the Middle East agreement in the coming days.",
      "And the U.S. military is preparing options to deploy as many as 200 U.S. troops to Israel to support the International Stabilization Force for the long-term internal security solution for Gaza and to support the flow of humanitarian aid and security assistance into Gaza, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "\u201cThey will not be in Gaza. No U.S. boots on the ground in Gaza,\u201d one of the officials said.",
      "The effort will be called the Civil-Military Coordination Cell, and U.S. troops could begin arriving in Israel immediately, the officials said.",
      "In addition to supporting moving aid and assistance into Gaza, they are expected to support the deconfliction mechanism between the two sides \u2014 basically making sure that both sides are upholding their part of the security agreements.",
      "\u201cI think right now,\u201d a senior U.S. official said, \u201cwe\u2019re just focused on making sure any gaps are patched up in the agreement.\u201d",
      "Trump allies say the agreement between Israel and Hamas, forged under immense pressure on both sides \u2014 including Trump\u2019s broad support for Israel\u2019s war in Gaza, the limits he placed on Netanyahu and a threat to let Israel destroy Hamas if it did not agree to the pact \u2014 is a testament to the validity of his peace-through-strength approach to foreign policy.",
      "\u201cHe understands that sometimes you have to use force to set the structure for peace,\u201d former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who is close to Trump, said in an interview last week."

      "Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee in the New York mayoral race, said Wednesday that it was \"too early\" to give President Donald Trump credit for negotiating a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, saying he would be willing to do so if the ceasefire is \"lasting\" and \"durable.\"",

      "Mamdani, who won the Democratic primary for mayor in June, beating almost a dozen other Democratic candidates \u2014 including former Gov. Andrew Cuomo \u2014 has come under scrutiny for his views on Israel and the Middle East.",
      "He has long supported recognizing the state of Palestine and labeled the war in Gaza a \"genocide,\" and he received criticism from his opponents and Jewish groups earlier when he initially declined to condemn the phrase \"globalize the intifada\" in a podcast interview.",
      "In June, Mamdani told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that it was \"not language that I use\" and that \u201cI don\u2019t believe that the role of the mayor is to police speech.\"",
      "Weeks later, The New York Times reported that Mamdani told business leaders that he would \"discourage\" others from using the phrase.",
      "In Wednesday's Fox News interview, Mamdani said that he was still skeptical that the peace deal would last, citing reports that Israeli soldiers killed five Palestinians in Gaza on Tuesday.",
      "\"I continue to have concerns, because I\u2019ve seen reports still, just in the last few days, that five Palestinians were killed by the Israeli military. And that\u2019s what gives me pause about issuing any kind of praise or celebration at a moment when it is still in its infancy,\" Mamdani told MacCallum.",
      "He also responded to the news that Hamas, which, as part of the peace deal, agreed to return living and deceased hostages taken in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, returned a body that was not that of one of the hostages.",
      "\u201cI think those are bodies or remains that should absolutely be returned. And I think that I have no issue critiquing Hamas or the Israeli government because my critiques all come from a place of universal human rights,\" Mamdani said.",
      "Several of the families of deceased hostages called this week for an \"immediate suspension\" of the ceasefire agreement when just four of 28 deceased hostages were initially returned to Israel.",
      "Trump traveled to Israel this week to oversee the implementation of the first phase of the peace deal and speak before the Israeli Knesset.",
      "Mamdani on Wednesday also reiterated his long-stated position about whether he would arrest Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under an arrest warrant that has been imposed by the International Criminal Court.",
      "\u201cThis is a city that believes in international law,\" he said, adding, \u201cI believe that we should uphold arrest warrants by the International Criminal Court.\"",

Abu Safiya was the lead physician in Gaza for MedGlobal before his detention.",
      "Prior to his detention in December 2024, Abu Safiya had warned that Israeli strikes were putting patients, medics and sheltering civilians at risk, calling for the world to intervene to \u201cprotect the health care system.\u201d He refused to leave the side of his patients, even as tanks and bulldozers encircled his hospital.",
      "Abu Safiya was last seen in Gaza in December walking from Kamal Adwan Hospital toward Israeli tanks. Video verified by NBC News showed Abu Safiya, a lone figure in a white doctor\u2019s coat, moving through a rubble-strewn street surrounded by bombed-out buildings. The footage was believed to capture the moments before he was detained by Israeli soldiers.",
      "After detention orders in Abu Safiya\u2019s case were previously upheld by an Israeli court in March, the Al Mezan Center for Human Rights maintained his innocence, saying in a news release that he was \u201csolely performing medical and administration duties at Kamal Adwan Hospital.\u201d",
      "Al Mezan says Abu Safiya reported enduring torture and inhumane living conditions to a lawyer who was previously able to visit him at Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank.",
      "A spokesperson for the Israeli Prison Service told NBC News it does not provide details regarding the \u201cidentity, conditions, or legal status of prisoners and detainees.\u201d",
      "The Israel Defense Forces has responded to those allegations by saying it acts in accordance with both the country\u2019s and international law and \u201cprotects the rights of individuals held in detention facilities under its responsibility.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment on the case, the Israeli military referred NBC News to the Israeli Ministry of Justice. In a statement, the ministry said it was not responsible for determining the identity of those who are released.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Healthcare Workers Watch, an initiative that documents detentions from Gaza, had said in a news release that 55 medical workers, including 24 nurses and seven doctors, were on lists of detainees from Gaza expected to be freed. It could not immediately confirm whether all were.",
      "At least 115 medical workers remained in Israeli custody, as well as the remains of four who died while in Israeli custody, it said in the news release on Monday.",
      "More than 9,000 Palestinians remain in Israeli prisons, according to data published by HaMoked, an Israeli human rights organization.",
      "Many of them are being held under \u201cadministrative detention,\u201d according to the organization \u2014 a practice in which Israeli authorities hold people without trial or other usual legal proceedings, often based on alleged secret evidence they often do not share with detainees, their families or legal representatives. Their fates are among the questions not addressed in President Donald Trump\u2019s plan.",
      "\u201cWe cannot rest easy nor look ahead to the colossal task of rebuilding Gaza\u2019s shattered health system until he and all of our health colleagues are safely home,\u201d Joseph Belliveau, MedGlobal\u2019s executive director, said in a statement shared with NBC News on Monday."

      "LONDON \u2014 It's safe to say they're making their presence felt.",
      "Japan's top sumo wrestlers were wandering the streets of London ahead of the sold-out Grand Sumo Tournament taking place this week at the Royal Albert Hall, the British capital's famous Victorian concert venue.",
      "Dressed in traditional Japanese clothing, the wrestlers known as rikishi, have been exploring the city in between rigorous training for what is just the second event of this type to be held outside Japan in 1,500 years.",
      "This time, the spotlight is on two highest-ranked wrestlers, known as yokozuna \u2014 Mongolian Hoshoryu Tomokatsu and Japan\u2019s Onosato Daiki. Onosato, 25, became the 75th fighter to earn that title in May, having risen to the rank in a record 13 tournaments.",
      "His rival, Hoshoryu, was the 74th man to attain the rank.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that sumo is back after so many years,\u201d Onosato told Sky News, NBC News\u2019 broadcasting partner, on Wednesday. \u201cI hope I can show the U.K. fans how fantastic sumo is.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing a yokozuna has a lot of responsibility,\u201d Hoshoryu said. \u201cMy uncle was a yokozuna \u2014 and I\u2019m happy to follow in his footsteps. But I came here to London as a yokozuna which he didn\u2019t, so I\u2019m even happier,\u201d he added.",
      "Stopping to pose for pictures with traditional souvenirs, the pair were among a group of sumo wrestlers who visited most of London's touristic landmarks, including Buckingham Palace and Westminster with its iconic Big Ben.",
      "But that didn't stop them from their rigorous training routine and their equally rigorous eating regime.",
      "Their carefully structured, high-calorie meals are vital for building the size and strength needed to compete at the highest level.",
      "\u201cWe are going through 70 kilos of rice a day,\u201d Donagh Collins, the CEO of Askonas Holt, an arts company which helped to organize the event, told Sky News. \u201cSomebody told me that the wholesaler for the noodles has run out of noodles,\u201d he added.",
      "But in a break from their traditional diet, some of the wrestlers were pictured enjoying London's street food and feeding each other hot dogs as they explored the city.",
      "While the tournament in London was completely sold out, back home Sumo has faced a series of scandals, including allegations of bullying, assault and sexism at stables where the wrestlers train. Allegations of illegal betting and links to organized crime have also cast a shadow over the image of Japan's national sport.",
      "But in London, Wednesday saw the first day of the five-day exhibition tournament \u2014 the first of its kind since one was hosted at the same venue some 34 years ago.",
      "The wrestlers, who weigh a combined six tons, slapped, gripped and lifted each other, as spectators reveled at the sight of the centuries-old Japanese sport.",
      "Around eleven tons of clay were brought into the hall to build the dohyo, the raised ring where the wrestlers compete, outlined with rice bales shaped and secured using beer bottles, according to Reuters.",
      "The two grand champions, Hoshoryu and Onosato, each secured victory in their bouts, closing the evening with weighty performances \u2014 literally."

      "CAESAREA, Israel \u2014 Ten years ago this week, two Palestinian attackers boarded a bus in Jerusalem and shot, beat and stabbed Israeli American educator Richard Lakin to death along with two others before police killed one of the militants and injured and arrested the other.",
      "The surviving assailant, Bilal Abu Ghanem, was freed in February from his three consecutive life sentences for murder as part of the last Israeli ceasefire and hostage release deal with Hamas.",
      "That\u2019s when his son, Micah Avni, had to watch his father\u2019s murderer go free.",
      "\u201cIt feels like I\u2019ve been betrayed by my country,\u201d Avni, 56, said the day before Hamas exchanged 24 Israeli hostages for about 2,000 Palestinian detainees and prisoners, including 250 serving life sentences for serious crimes including terrorism.",
      "Avni\u2019s anguish and anger have now merged with a larger collective, shared by many Israelis whose loved ones were killed or maimed in terror attacks and who must now watch the perpetrators walk free as part of the latest ceasefire negotiated by the Trump administration.",
      "Their torment hasn\u2019t just punctured the euphoria surrounding last week\u2019s agreement \u2014 it very nearly halted the deal and could still frustrate its full implementation.",
      "Two far-right political parties in Israel\u2019s government cited the release of 250 convicts as their reason for voting against President Donald Trump\u2019s ceasefire and hostage release plan.",
      "\u201cAlongside this joy, it is absolutely forbidden to ignore the question of the price: the release of thousands of terrorists,\u201d said Itamar Ben-Gvir, the far-right minister of national security and leader of the Otzma Yehudit party, in a statement explaining his party\u2019s opposition. \u201cThese are terrorists whose past experience proves that they will return to terrorism and their art of working to murder Jews.\u201d",
      "While Ben-Gvir and others refer to thousands of \u201cterrorists\u201d released, 250 of those released were convicted of serious crimes.",
      "Most of the rest of the more than 1,700 people let go, among them doctors, nurses and journalists, had been held without charge. These detainees were not involved in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks and were held under a controversial practice called administrative detention, which allows Israel to detain people for an indefinite period of time without ever charging them. More than 20 minors were on the list.",
      "For Palestinians in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, the releases were cause for celebrations. Prisoners and detainees who returned to Gaza rode on the tops of buses through crowds of well-wishers.",
      "In the West Bank, families waited for the released prisoners outside the Ramallah Cultural Palace in the Palestinians\u2019 provisional capital. Some women and young girls arrived in traditional Palestinian dresses. Many refused to speak to the gathered press: Israel\u2019s military, they said, had called them and warned them not speak to the media.",
      "The prisoners\u2019 families said they had seen others being re-arrested in the past and didn\u2019t want to gamble on the convicts\u2019 hard-won freedom.",
      "\u201cFor Israel, any Palestinian is a terrorist,\u201d said the uncle of one of the released Palestinians, who refused to give his name, \u201ceven if they didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d",
      "In addition, there is the collective pain of nearly 2 million in Gaza who have endured Israel\u2019s two-year war against Hamas. There is little hope among Palestinians that anybody will be held responsible for the tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed by Israeli fire, along with those maimed in attacks.",
      "Israel has accused Hamas of operating in civilian areas, thus necessitating attacks that endanger noncombatants. In November, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas military chief Mohammed Deif, whom Israel said it had killed, over alleged crimes against humanity and war crimes.",
      "Israel has forcefully rejected the allegations, and Netanyahu\u2019s office branded the decision \u201cantisemitic,\u201d rejecting them as \u201cabsurd and false\u201d and condemning the ICC as a \u201cbiased and discriminatory political body.\u201d",
      "Tinged with sadness",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu acknowledged many Israelis\u2019 public pain in comments on Sunday night.",
      "\u201cTomorrow, our sons will return to their borders,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a historic event that is tinged with sadness over the release of murderers \u2014 and joy over the return of kidnapped people.\u201d",
      "Under President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point plan for ending the fighting, Hamas fighters who lay down their weapons would be spared any punishment \u2014 a condition that has also raised grave reservations among many Israelis, including Netanyahu, who had hoped to see Hamas destroyed.",
      "Rachel Goldberg-Polin, an American Israeli whose son, Hersh, was kidnapped on Oct. 7 and then killed by Hamas last year, said she\u2019s rejected the feelings of anger that come with grief.",
      "\u201cNothing can bring Hersh back,\u201d she said in an interview last week. \u201cI tend to look at this in a very zoomed-out way. I don\u2019t have this fiery venomous anger that I think wouldn\u2019t serve me in any purpose.\u201d",
      "Avni, who opposed this week\u2019s deal, said he worries that the released convicts will simply return to the battlefield or engage in terrorism against Israelis.",
      "\u201cObviously, every single Jewish person wants to get the hostages back,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that strategically trading thousands of terrorists for 20 lives makes sense.\u201d",
      "Avni has advocated executing terrorists as a way to remove prisoner exchanges from the negotiating table. Israeli law allows for capital punishment, but only for treason and \u201ccrimes against humanity.\u201d The death sentence has been used only twice in Israeli history.",
      "In the hours after his father\u2019s murder, Avni admits that he considered taking matters into his own hands. Both Lakin and Abu Ghanem were taken to the same ward in the same Jerusalem hospital after the attack.",
      "The two men were treated only yards apart. Lakin died, but his killer survived.",
      "\u201cI think I would have jumped on him and done something but he had police standing there,\u201d Avni said. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, you know, you\u2019ll go to jail for life, and you\u2019ve got responsibilities.\u201d",
      "Recounting the cruel irony of his father\u2019s killing still brings tears to Avni\u2019s eyes. His father had been a peace-loving school principal who advocated for racially integrated education, had marched with Martin Luther King Jr. and participated in the anti-segregation \u201cFreedom Riders\u201d movement during the 1960s.",
      "The family moved to Israel when Avni was 15 years old.",
      "\u201cHe was a big believer in coexistence. I wish everybody could be like that, but they\u2019re not,\u201d Avni said of his father. \u201cIt was an innocent world view.\u201d",

      "U.S. officials so far have not provided detailed information about exactly what narcotics have been in most of the targeted vessels.",
      "The Trump administration has labeled multiple drug cartels from Venezuela and other Latin American countries as foreign terrorist organizations, citing in part the high death toll from fentanyl use in the United States.",
      "Fentanyl is mainly smuggled over land routes in small, easily concealed amounts across the Mexico-U.S. border, not by boat through the Caribbean, experts say.",
      "The administration has offered different explanations about the goal of the strikes in the Caribbean. Officials have portrayed the operations as a bold move against the threat posed by drug cartels. But officials also have suggested that the strikes \u2014 and a ramped-up U.S. military presence in the region \u2014 are meant to pile pressure on the regime in Venezuela."

      "After initially laying blame on Ukraine for the war and suggesting Kyiv would have to cede territory, he has since shifted his position and said Ukraine could win back all of its occupied land from Russia. In more than 3\u00bd years of fighting, Kyiv, backed by its Western allies, has managed to reclaim chunks of its land through successful counteroffensive campaigns, but Russia still occupies about one-fifth of Ukraine's territory.",

    "summary": "New dietary guidelines from the British Dietetic Association say that kiwis \u2014 along with rye bread and certain supplements \u2014 can help improve constipation symptoms.",
    "story": [
      "When it comes to the best foods for easing chronic constipation, are kiwis on your grocery list?",
      "New dietary guidelines from the British Dietetic Association, published Monday, say that kiwis \u2014 along with rye bread and certain supplements \u2014 can help improve constipation symptoms.",
      "The guidelines, the authors say, are the first evidence-based recommendations for treating constipation with diet, not medications.",
      "Chronic constipation affects around 16% of adults worldwide, and constipation is the reason for almost 2.5 million doctors visits in the U.S. per year, according to the American College of Gastroenterology.",
      "Eirini Dimidi, a lead author of the guidelines, said the existing guidance for managing chronic constipation is largely focused on pharmaceuticals.",
      "The few dietary recommendations out there \u2014 eat more fiber, drink more water \u2014 are ambiguous and often lack research to back them up.",
      "\u201cI remember looking at the guidelines and realizing that they are just really limited in the number of dietary recommendations they make,\u201d said Dimidi, a registered dietician and associate professor in the department of nutritional sciences at King\u2019s College in London.",
      "To come up with the new guidelines, the authors analyzed clinical trials and evaluated each method\u2019s effectiveness for managing constipation. The recommendations were jointly published in the Journal of Human Nutrition & Dietetics and Neurogastroenterology & Motility.",
      "What is chronic constipation?",
      "Constipation \u2014 defined by fewer than three bowel movements a week \u2014 is considered chronic if it lasts for more than three months.",
      "Symptoms can vary from person to person, but common ones are hard or lumpy stool, stomachache and nausea. More serious symptoms of constipation include blood in stool, fever and vomiting.",
      "Constipation can be caused by diet, lifestyle, certain illnesses and injuries, and some medications. It\u2019s extremely common, affecting people of all ages, gender and race.",
      "\u201cI see chronic constipation across the spectrum,\u201d said Sue-Ellen Anderson-Haynes, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. \u201cI see it in toddlers, I see it in school-age children, I see it in adults. So it\u2019s a common thing,\u201d she said.",
      "Chronic constipation can severely impact people\u2019s lives and limit their physical abilities, worsening their quality of life and work productivity.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re chronically constipated, you may not be able to even participate in physical activity, because you feel bloated, you\u2019re in pain, you\u2019re achy, it may affect your mood,\u201d said Anderson-Haynes, who also owns 360 Girls and Women, a nutrition and health practice based in Boston.",
      "How is chronic constipation treated?",
      "Dr. William Chey, professor of gastroenterology at the University of Michigan and incoming president of the American College of Gastroenterology, said most studies on treating chronic constipation have focused on fiber supplements, like psyllium, and medications, like bisacodyl, senna and amitiza.",
      "He added American guidelines \u201cfocus pretty heavily on medical therapies for chronic constipation.\u201d",
      "Traditional constipation treatments include increasing fiber intake through foods like prunes and other fruits and vegetables, drinking more water, and using different kinds of laxatives.",
      "While the new guidelines include certain fiber-rich foods and fiber supplements, there\u2019s no guidance on a \u201chigh-fiber diet\u201d overall.",
      "\u201cWhen we were building these guidelines, and looking at the literature, we were expecting a lot more evidence on a high-fiber diet, and there simply isn\u2019t enough in constipation,\u201d Dimidi said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that a high-fiber diet is very beneficial for our overall health and also for elements of gut health, such as reducing the risk of colorectal cancer,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it comes to constipation, specifically, we just don\u2019t have enough evidence to say that it improves constipation.\u201d",
      "What are the new recommendations?",
      "Chey, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new guidelines, said the recommendations \u201cprovide a valuable road map to things that [people] can try as they\u2019re waiting to see their primary care physician.\u201d",
      "He added that people with more severe cases of constipation may need to see a gastroenterologist.",
      "The recommendations include:",
      "Fiber supplements: More than 10 grams of fiber supplements, such as psyllium, per day can improve stool frequency and consistency and aid in reducing straining. Fiber supplements should be slowly introduced and dosage gradually increased.Probiotics: Certain strains of probiotics, including, B. lactis and Bacillus coagulans Unique IS2, may help some people with symptoms. If taking one, patients should take a supplement of their choice and follow the manufacturer\u2019s instructions for at least four weeks.Magnesium oxide supplements: 0.5-1.5 grams daily can help with stool frequency and consistency, reduce symptoms such as bloating and abdominal pain and improve overall quality of life. Dosage should start at 0.5 grams per day and be gradually increased weekly.Kiwis: Three daily, with or without the skin, can help improve stool frequency but not consistency.Rye bread: Six to eight slices of rye bread per day can also aid stool frequency, but not consistency. The authors noted that this amount may not be realistic for some people.High mineral-content water: In combination with other treatments, 0.5-1.5 liters per day of high mineral-content water may also help. One of the key minerals in high mineral-content water, magnesium, is a known laxative.",

      "Still, overall, he said, \u201cI think these kinds of recommendations are going to be very helpful.\u201d",
      "Dimidi said she hopes the release of the guidelines can \u201cempower\u201d those with chronic constipation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re hoping [the guidance] means that clinicians are very well-informed and can provide personalized advice to their patients that is very effective,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also that people themselves with constipation can access now evidence-based information, feel empowered to take control of the symptoms and improve a condition that has a tremendous impact on quality of life.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 A jubilant Donald Trump celebrated a hard-won ceasefire Monday in the conflict between Israel and Hamas militants, while inviting Middle East leaders to create a lasting peace that unlocks the region\u2019s potential for dramatic economic growth.",
      "As all 20 living hostages rejoined their families in Israel, Trump spoke to the nation's parliament in Jerusalem and marked a momentous breakthrough in a war that began just over two years ago.",
      "The U.S. president who wrung a peace deal from bitter combatants told the Knesset that \u201cthe long and painful nightmare is finally over.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not only the end of a war,\u201d said Trump, who had arrived in Israel in the morning. \u201cThis is the end of an age of terror and death and the beginning of the age of faith and hope and of God.",
      "\"It\u2019s the start of a grand concord and lasting harmony for Israel and all the nations of what will soon be a truly magnificent region.\u201d",
      "Making it so won\u2019t be easy. Old antagonisms could resurface at any point, jeopardizing the truce that Trump and his advisers brokered over the past few months.",
      "An accusation of bad faith came right away. Family members said Monday that Hamas had released the remains of only four of 28 deceased hostages, breaking a commitment. They called for an \u201cimmediate suspension\u201d of the ceasefire agreement until all the bodies are returned.",
      "Dueling statements from Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also suggested they differed over something as fundamental as whether the fighting was truly over.",
      "Netanyahu, speaking on television Sunday, said, \u201cThe campaign is not over\u201d and that \u201csome of our enemies are trying to recover in order to attack us again.\u201d",
      "Asked about that on Air Force One en route to Israel, Trump told reporters: \u201cThe war is over. The war is over. The war is over, OK? You understand that?\u201d Lest there be any doubt, Trump reinforced the point during his remarks to the Knesset while Netanyahu sat and listened.",
      "\u201cNow you can be a little nicer, Bibi, because you\u2019re not at war anymore, Bibi,\u201d he said, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname.",
      "After finishing his speech, Trump flew to Egypt to take part in a peace conference with the leaders of 20 nations, posing for pictures in front of a sign proclaiming, \u201cPeace in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "Notably missing from the signing ceremony were the two parties who\u2019d been at war: Hamas and Israel. Trump had invited Netanyahu to the ceremony in Sharm el-Sheikh, but the Israeli leader chose not to attend. His office cited the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah as the reason. Without Netanyahu and a representative from Hamas, the day lacked what often turns out to be an iconic picture at such Middle East peace ceremonies: the U.S. president and the combatants linking arms.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary moment and demonstration of will by an American president: a bid to end the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza,\u201d Aaron David Miller, a former State Department Middle East analyst and negotiator in Republican and Democratic administrations, said in an interview. \u201cBut to do that you need to climb several very high mountains.\u201d",
      "Richard Goldberg, who served on the White House National Security Council in Trump\u2019s first term, wrote on X: \u201cToday is a celebration. Trump and Netanyahu delivered the opportunity for peace through strength.\u201d",
      "\u201cTomorrow is harder,\u201d he added. \u201cWords like demilitarizing, disarming and de-radicalizing are just words without action. Every step will be filled with pitfalls. Every step will be contested by forces that do not support the Trump vision for peace. By Iran. By the Muslim Brotherhood. By the U.N. By others.\u201d",
      "As for the future, the Trump administration appears to have less of a blueprint than an aspiration. Last month, Trump released a 20-point peace plan that starts with ending the war in Gaza and ends with forging a broader peace between Israel and the Palestinians.",
      "The first part is specific; the latter, vague. The 19th point says that certain conditions that include reconstruction of Gaza and political reform must be met and then, once that happens, \u201cthe conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d The authors set no hard deadlines or timetables for deciding the Palestinians\u2019 fate.",
      "At home, Trump is enmeshed in a government shutdown with no end in sight. But presidents enjoy far more latitude when it comes to foreign policy, and Trump appears to be savoring his achievement overseas.",
      "A senior administration official traveling with Trump on the quick trip to Israel and Egypt said of the president\u2019s mood: \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen him so proud.\u201d",
      "Another official, back in Washington, said: \u201cEveryone is taking great pride in it and wants to be part of it. And it\u2019s an acute reminder that we can do the hard things.\u201d",
      "Trump tapped two confidants to negotiate the deal: his son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House envoy Steve Witkoff, a billionaire real estate developer. Both watched in the Knesset as Trump delivered an hour-long speech, relishing the moment and riffing in ways that made members laugh and applaud in surprise.",
      "\u201cTrump! Trump! Trump,\u201d lawmakers chanted. Some wore his signature piece of campaign memorabilia, a red hat with a twist that read: \u201cTrump, the Peace President.\u201d",
      "Seizing on the good will, Trump made a personal plea to help a friend. Netanyahu is facing trial on corruption charges. Trump went off script to beseech Israeli President Isaac Herzog to pardon the prime minister.",
      "\u201cThis man is a good man right here. I have an idea. Mr. President, why don\u2019t you give him a pardon?\u201d Trump said.",
      "Now that the fighting has stopped and the hostages have been returned, Trump's interest could potentially wane. As the leader with the most leverage in the region, Trump needs to stay involved to make progress on his vision of a transformed Middle East, foreign policy analysts said.",
      "For Trump, there is at least one clear incentive to stay engaged.",
      "He lost out on the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize last week, and his supporters are already lobbying for him to get the award next year.",
      "\"You have to wonder whether he stays with this,\" Miller, the former negotiator, said. \"That will depend primarily on whether there's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow: the elusive Nobel, which he believes he deserves.\""

      "As Israeli hostages are freed and Palestinian prisoners and detainees released \u2014 and after President Donald Trump's lengthy address to Israel\u2019s parliament on Monday \u2014 focus is shifting to what comes next.",
      "Some of the longest applause for Trump's speech came when he said that virtually the whole region had endorsed a plan for Gaza to be demilitarized and Hamas to disarm \u2014 key elements of his 20-point plan that have yet to actually be agreed upon.",
      "Now that phase one of his plan is being executed, negotiators and neighboring countries will watch whether key points of Trump\u2019s proposal will be accepted by both Israel and Hamas in talks on the next phases.",
      "Last few days",
      "A ceasefire came into effect in Gaza on Friday at noon local time, (5 a.m. ET), after the first phase of Trump's plan was agreed by Israel and Hamas, bringing relative calm to the enclave for the first time in months since the last truce collapsed in March.",
      "Under the first phase of Trump's plan, 20 living hostages were  handed over to Israel on Monday.  The remains of a further 28 hostages held by Hamas were expected to be released within 72 hours, although only four were initially, much to the disappointment of families.",
      "Israel also pledged to release 250 convicted prisoners and 1,700 Palestinians detained since Oct. 7.  Over 150 of the freed prisoners were deported to Egypt.",
      "More aid has begun to flow into the enclave in recent days, although it falls far short of what aid workers say is necessary.",
      "Now what?",
      "Hamas has long asserted that it would not release the last of the hostages until Israeli groups leave Gaza entirely, but having agreed to the first phase of Trump's plan, the militant group is relying on guarantees from Trump that a full withdrawal will eventually happen.",
      "When and if Israel withdraws fully remains unclear.",
      "Meanwhile, it is also unclear whether Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since 2007, will agree to a key stipulation of Trump's overall plan, as well as a crucial demand from Israel \u2014 that it disarm.",
      "Hamas has long refused calls to lay down arms, saying it has a right to armed resistance until Israel ends its occupation of Palestinian territories \u2014 and that has been a key sticking point in talks to negotiate an end to Israel's offensive in Gaza.",
      "In an interview with Al Jazeera on Oct. 9, senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said that no Palestinian would accept surrendering weapons and that the people of Gaza were in greater need than ever of resistance.",
      "The militant group has agreed to step down from leadership over the territory and relinquish governance to a transitional body of Palestinian technocrats, which would be overseen by an international body, dubbed the \"Board of Peace.\" This body is expected to be headed by Trump, with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair also named as a possible member of the oversight body.",
      "Noting the plan aboard the Air Force One on Monday en route to Israel, Trump said he first wanted to find out whether \"Tony would be popular with all.\"",
      "\"I like Tony, I\u2019ve always liked Tony, but I want to find out that he\u2019s an acceptable choice to everybody,\" he added.",
      "The idea of Blair joining the board has already drawn early criticism, with his reputation in the region shadowed by his decision to back the U.S.-led 2003 invasion of Iraq \u2014 and claims by the U.S. and Britain of Iraq having weapons of mass destruction found to be false.",
      "Trump optimistic",
      "Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Israel on Monday, Trump said he believed \"everybody is happy\" with his 20-point peace plan.",
      "Noting that much of Gaza now resembles a \"demolition site\" after more than two years of Israel's offensive in the enclave, Trump said cleanup efforts would begin \"pretty much immediately.\"",

      "\u201cNow, it is time to translate these victories against terrorists on the battlefield into the ultimate prize of peace and prosperity for the entire Middle East,\u201d he said.",

      "The deadline for nominating people for the Nobel Prize was Jan. 31 \u2014 11 days into Trump\u2019s new term. Still, the committee was free to consider accomplishments that came later in the year as it winnowed down the candidates, said Nina Graeger, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, who handicaps the top candidates for the prize.",
      "\u201cWill you get the Nobel Prize? Absolutely not,\u201d Trump told an audience of generals and admirals last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll give it to some guy that didn\u2019t do a damn thing.\u201d",
      "But he believed it would be advantageous to strike the Middle East peace deal before the committee revealed the winner, a person who has been in meetings with him said. That way, Trump could make the argument that the committee process was \u201crigged\u201d; a president who ended so many conflicts rightly should have gotten the award that celebrates peace, this person said.",
      "Shortly after the winner was announced, Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, posted on social media that \u201cThe Nobel Committee proved they place politics over peace.\u201d",
      "Much can happen in a year\u2019s time. If the peace deal in Gaza doesn\u2019t hold \u2014 if the fighting resumes and more Gazans die in the crossfire \u2014 Trump isn\u2019t likely to get credit for raising false hopes that peace was at hand, foreign policy analysts say.",
      "The committee will want to see if the peace deal that Trump describes as an historic triumph is real or ephemeral.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know if the peace plan will be sustainable and lasting,\u201d Graeger said. \u201cHe definitely should get credit for his efforts to end the war and really engaging with this process. But there are a lot of hurdles in the implementation of the plan.\u201d",
      "A second issue is whether the \u201cAmerica First\u201d president chooses to work more collaboratively with other nations over the coming year. In creating the prize, Swedish inventor and entrepreneur Alfred Nobel held that the winner should be someone who has \u201cdone the most or the best work for fraternity between nations,\u201d among other criteria.",
      "It doesn\u2019t help Trump\u2019s chances that he threatened to acquire Canada, Greenland and the Panama Canal, analysts said. Nor is the committee likely to reward him for pulling out of such cross-border endeavors as the Paris climate agreement or the World Health Organization, they said.",
      "K\u00e5re Aas, Norway\u2019s former ambassador to the U.S., said that Trump would be a \u201cstrong contender\u201d for the prize if he ends the Russia-Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas wars. Still, the president wouldn\u2019t be a shoo-in, he added.",
      "Trump\u2019s statements about absorbing Greenland and Canada \u201cwould also be considered by the committee,\u201d Aas said. \u201cThe committee doesn\u2019t necessarily give him the Nobel Peace Prize if there\u2019s peace in Gaza and Ukraine next year.\u201d"
