      "NEW YORK -- Paramount Skydance is taking another step in its hostile takeover bid of Warner Bros. Discovery, saying Monday that it will name its own slate of directors before the next shareholder meeting of the Hollywood studio.",
      "Paramount also filed a suit in Delaware Chancery Court seeking to compel Warner Bros. to disclose to shareholders how it values its bid and the competing offer from Netflix.",
      "Warner Bros. is in the middle of a bidding war between Paramount and Netflix. Warner\u2019s leadership has repeatedly rebuffed overtures from Skydance-owned Paramount \u2014 and urged shareholders to back the sale of its streaming and studio business to Netflix for $72 billion. Paramount, meanwhile, has made efforts to sweeten its $77.9 billion hostile offer for the entire company.",
      "Last week, Warner Bros. Discovery said its board determined Paramount\u2019s offer is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders. It again recommended shareholders support the Netflix deal.",

      "Some celebrities have donned anti-ICE pins at the Golden Globes ceremony in tribute to Renee Good, who was shot and killed by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Minneapolis this week",
      "Some celebrities donned anti-ICE pins at the Golden Globes on Sunday in tribute to Renee Good, who was shot and killed in her car by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer this week in Minneapolis.",
      "The black-and-white pins displayed slogans like \u201cBE GOOD\u201d and \u201cICE OUT,\u201d introducing a political angle into the awards show after last year\u2019s relatively apolitical ceremony.",
      "Mark Ruffalo, Wanda Sykes and Natasha Lyonne wore the pins on the red carpet, while Jean Smart and Ariana Grande donned them once inside the ballroom. Smart had the pin on her dress as she accepted the award for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy series.",
      "Since the shooting Wednesday, protests have broken out across the country, calling for accountability for Good's death as well as a separate shooting in Portland where Border Patrol agents wounded two people. Some protests have resulted in clashes with law enforcement, especially in Minneapolis, where ICE is carrying out its largest immigration enforcement operation to date.",
      "\u201cWe need every part of civil society, society to speak up,\u201d said Nelini Stamp of Working Families Power, one of the organizers for the anti-ICE pins. \u201cWe need our artists. We need our entertainers. We need the folks who reflect society.\u201d",
      "Congressmembers have vowed an assertive response, and an FBI investigation into Good's killing is ongoing. The Trump administration has doubled down in defending the ICE officer's actions, maintaining that he was acting in self-defense and thought Good would hit him with her car.",
      "Just a week before Good was killed, an off-duty ICE officer fatally shot and killed 43-year-old Keith Porter in Los Angeles. His death sparked protests in the Los Angeles area, calling for the officer responsible to be arrested.",
      "The idea for the \u201cICE OUT\u201d pins began with a late-night text exchange earlier this week between Stamp and Jess Morales Rocketto, the executive director of a Latino advocacy group called Maremoto.",
      "They know that high-profile cultural moments can introduce millions of viewers to social issues. This is the third year of Golden Globes activism for Morales Rocketto, who has previously rallied Hollywood to protest the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policies. Stamp said she always thinks of the 1973 Oscars, when Sacheen Littlefeather took Marlon Brando\u2019s place and declined his award to protest American entertainment\u2019s portrayal of Native Americans.",

      "\u201cThere is a longstanding tradition of people who create art taking a stand for justice in moments,\u201d Stamp said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue that tradition.\u201d",
      "Allies of their movement have been attending the \u201cfancy events\u201d that take place in the days leading up to the Golden Globes, according to Stamp. They\u2019re passing out the pins at parties and distributing them to neighbors who will be attending tonight\u2019s ceremony.",
      "\u201cThey put it in their purse and they\u2019re like, \u2018Hey would you wear this?\u2019 It\u2019s so grassroots,\u201d Morales Rocketto said.",

      "References to President Donald Trump\u2019s two impeachments have been removed from his photo portrait display at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery in Washington",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's photo portrait display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has had references to his two impeachments removed, the latest apparent change at the collection of museums he has accused of bias as he asserts his influence over how official presentations document U.S. history.",
      "The wall text, which summarized Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \u201cAmerican Presidents\u201d exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Trump taken during his first term. Now, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though the text was available online. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen Sunday, did not include any extended text.",
      "The White House did not say whether it sought any changes. Nor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions. But Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \u201censure alignment with the president\u2019s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\u201d",
      "Trump's original \u201cportrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \u201cImpeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\u201d",
      "Then the text continues: \u201cAfter losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\u201d",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Trump's \u201cunmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\u201d",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries such as what had been part of Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",
      "Ingle did not answer questions about whether Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.",
      "The gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.",
      "\u201cThe museum is beginning its planned update of the America\u2019s Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\u201d the gallery statement said. \u201cFor some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist\u2019s name.\u201d",

      "And, the gallery statement noted, \u201cThe history of Presidential impeachments continues to be represented in our museums, including the National Museum of American History.\u201d",
      "Trump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents U.S. history and culture. He has offered an especially harsh assessment of how the Smithsonian and other museums have featured chattel slavery as a seminal variable in the nation's development but also taken steps to reshape how he and his contemporary rivals are depicted.",
      "In the months before his order for a Smithsonian review, he fired the head archivist of the National Archives and said he was firing the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, as part of his overhaul. Sajet maintained the backing of the Smithsonian's governing board, but she ultimately resigned.",
      "At the White House, Trump has designed a notably partisan and subjective \u201cPresidential Walk of Fame\u201d featuring gilded photographs of himself and his predecessors \u2014 with the exception of Biden, who is represented by an autopen \u2014 along with plaques describing their presidencies.",
      "The White House said at the time that Trump himself was a primary author of the plaques. Notably, Trump's two plaques praise the 45th and 47th president as a historically successful figure while those under Biden's autopen stand-in describe the 46th executive as \u201cby far, the worst President in American History\u201d who \u201cbrought our Nation to the brink of destruction.\u201d",

He became just the second filmmaker to sweep director, screenplay and film, as a producer, at the Globes. Only Oliver Stone, for \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d managed the same feat.",
      "In an awards ceremony that went almost entirely as expected, the night's final award was the most surprising. While \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d has been the clear front-runner this awards season, most have pegged Ryan Coogler's Jim Crow-era vampire thriller as its closest competition.",
      "But \u201cHamnet,\u201d a speculative drama about William and Agnes Shakespeare based on Maggie O\u2019Farrell's bestseller, won in the dramatic category shortly after its star, Jessie Buckley, won best female actor in a drama.",

Zhao fondly recalled being at Sundance Labs with Coogler when they were each starting out.",

      "Bob Weir, guitarist, singer and founding member of the Grateful Dead, has died at age 78",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Bob Weir, the guitarist and singer who as an essential member of the Grateful Dead helped found the sound of the San Francisco counterculture of the 1960s and kept it alive through decades of endless tours and marathon jams, has died. He was 78.",
      "Weir\u2019s death was announced Saturday in a statement on his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cIt is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\u201d a statement on his Instagram posted Saturday said. \u201cHe transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\u201d",
      "Weir joined the Grateful Dead \u2014 originally the Warlocks \u2014 in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He would spend the next 30 years playing on endless tours with the Grateful Dead alongside fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia, who died in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \u201cSugar Magnolia,\u201d \u201cOne More Saturday Night\u201d and \u201cMexicali Blues.\u201d",
      "After Garcia\u2019s death, he would be the Dead's most recognizable face. In the decades since, he kept playing with other projects that kept alive the band's music and legendary fan base, including Dead & Company.",
      "\u201cFor over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\u201d the Instagram statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music.\u201d",
      "Weir\u2019s death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \u201cPigpen\u201d McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concerts for the Grateful Dead\u2019s 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, drawing some 60,000 fans a day for three days.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but he had a long beard like Garcia\u2019s in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",

      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \u201cain't no time to hate\u201d and \u201cnot all who wander are lost.\u201d",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \u201cTouch of Grey,\u201d the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\u201cI venture to say they are the great American band,\u201d TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \u201cWhat a wonder they are.\u201d",

      "K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture",
      "NEW YORK -- Two things can be true at once. K-pop is an inextricable force in global pop culture, and it has long been undercelebrated at institutions like the Grammys \u2014 where K-pop artists have performed but have never taken home a trophy.",
      "That could change at next month's 2026 Grammy Awards ceremony. Songs released by K-pop artists \u2014 or K-pop-adjacent artists, more on that later \u2014 have received nominations in the big four categories for the first time. Ros\u00e9, perhaps best known as one-fourth of the juggernaut girl group Blackpink, is the first K-pop artist to ever receive a nomination in the record of the year field for \u201cAPT.,\u201d her megahit with Grammys' favorite Bruno Mars.",
      "The song of the year category also features K-pop nominees for the first time. \u201cAPT.\u201d will go head-to-head with the fictional girl group HUNTR/X's \u201cGolden,\u201d performed by Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami from the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d soundtrack.",
      "And the girl group Katseye, the brain child of HYBE \u2014 the entertainment company behind K-pop sensation BTS and countless other international acts \u2014 fashioned in the image of the K-pop idol system, has been nominated for best new artist.",
      "It depends on who you ask.",
      "Areum Jeong, assistant professor of Korean Studies at Arizona State University and author of \u201cK-pop Fandom: Performing Deokhu from the 1990s to Today\u201d says the majority of these nominations strike her more as \u201ca de-territorialized, hybrid idea of K-pop,\u201d instead of a recognition of K-pop.",
      "While Ros\u00e9 \u201cwas recruited and trained under the K-pop system, and while \u2018APT.\u2019 does contain some motifs from the Korean drinking game,\u201d Jeong says, \u201cthe song does not feel like a localized K-pop production. \u2026 Same with Katseye, who was trained and produced under HYBE but marketed more toward Western fans and listeners.\u201d",
      "Jeong says that both \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye's \u201cGabriela\u201d \u2014 both of which will go head-to-head with \u201cGolden\u201d in the pop duo/group performance category \u2014 \u201cseem less K-pop than other K-pop songs that could have been nominated over the years.\u201d",
      "She argues the same is true for the music of \u201cKpop Demon Hunters.\u201d \u201cIt is very similar to \u2018APT.\u2019 in that it takes inspiration and motif from Korean culture,\u201d where \u201cK-pop serves as an idea, a jumping-off point, or a motif, creating alternatives or new possibilities.\u201d",
      "Mathieu Berbiguier, a visiting assistant professor in Korean Studies at Carnegie Mellon University, points out that these nominations differ from past K-pop Grammy nominations because \u201cGolden,\u201d \u201cAPT.\u201d and Katseye all feature \u201ca mainstream popular music factor.\u201d",
      "That's the connection of a massive popular Netflix film (\u201cKpop Demon Hunters\u201d), a collaboration with Bruno Mars (\u201cAPT.\u201d), and Katseye's international membership and Netflix series (\u201cPop Star Academy: Katseye\u201d), respectively.",
      "\u201cIt tells you that K-pop is not considered as something niche anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, when we think about pop music in general, we also think of K-pop as part of it.\u201d",
      "Bernie Cho, industry expert and president of the South Korean agency, the DFSB Kollective, agrees that there is an international, mainstream appeal to the nominees.",
      "\u201cAll the nominees represent a sort of post-idol K-pop, in the sense that Ros\u00e9, the three ladies of HUNTR/X and Katseye represent the globalized version of K-pop, where the \u2018K\u2019 is very much there, but some people might argue it\u2019s silent. The songs are not necessarily for Korea, by Korea, from Korea, just kind of beyond Korea,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a celebration and testament to how diverse and dynamic K-pop has become.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the Recording Academy has snubbed K-pop acts that have set record-breaking standards, such as BTS,Seventeen and Stray Kids,\u201d argues Jeong. \u201cI think one of the main reasons is that the Western world is still so resistant to non-English lyrics.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt does not surprise me that \u2018APT.\u2019 and Katseye\u2019s music, which mainly contain English lyrics and seem less K-pop, were nominated,\u201d she continues.",

      "\u201cYes, it's a big moment for K-pop, but it is so overdue, these recognitions are more of a sign of how poorly the music industry in the U.S. did this year that we're looking externally,\u201d she says.",
      "She argues that acknowledgment of Korean entertainment from U.S. entertainment industries is more symbolic of U.S. cultural dominance slipping than \u201cK-pop being really good, because K-pop has been really good for a really long time,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is all recognition of just global storytelling improvement, global taste-making improvement.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't want to diminish it,\u201d she adds. \u201cThese are all universally friendly, accessible, good pop songs.\u201d",
      "And if they weren't, they wouldn't connect.",
      "\u201cIt's very obvious that they\u2019re not just performers. They're artists. They're singers. They're songwriters,\u201d says Cho.",
      "The jury is still out.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s not even a matter of if or when. It\u2019s going to be who and how many,\u201d says Cho.",
      "Others are less committal. \u201cIt's hard to predict,\u201d says Berbiguier. \u201cFor me, it's more possible that \u2018Golden\u2019 gets one.\u201d",
      "\u201cYes and no,\u201d offers Herman. For her, it depends on an evolving and fluid definition of K-pop. After all, HUNTR/X is a fictional girl group from an animated film that did not debut through the K-pop music industry system. Would a victory for their song \u201cGolden\u201d mean a victory of K-pop? That's a matter of opinion.",

      "Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos has canceled her upcoming performances at the Kennedy Center in Washington",
      "NEW YORK -- Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Sonia De Los Santos is the latest performer to cancel an appearance at the Kennedy Center in Washington. She had been scheduled to give two concerts for young people on Feb. 7, followed by a \u201ccreative conversation\u201d with the audience.",
      "De Los Santos, a Mexican American whose 2018 release \u201c\u00a1Alegr\u00eda!\u201d received a Latin Grammy nomination for best children's album, cited her background as a reason for calling off the shows.",
      "\"As an artist, I treasure the freedom to create and share my music, and for many years I have used this privilege to uplift the stories of immigrants in this country,\" she wrote Thursday on Instagram. \u201cUnfortunately, I do not feel that the current climate at this beloved venue represents a welcoming space for myself, my band, or our audience.\u201d",
      "In an email to The Associated Press, De Los Santos shared her Instagram statement and said she would have no additional comment. Kennedy Center spokesperson Roma Daravi challenged De Los Santos' citing of immigration policy.",
      "\u201cThis country was built on legal immigrants and as a first generation American, I find her statement highly offensive,\" Daravi wrote in an email. \"Refusing to engage with an institution open to everyone is, in fact, a step towards discrimination.\u201d",
      "Artists ranging from \u201cHamilton\u201d creator Lin-Manuel Miranda to rock star Peter Wolf have called off events at the Kennedy Center since President Donald Trump ousted the previous leadership early last year and arranged for himself to head the board of trustees. Trump has highlighted the Kennedy Center in his wide-ranging fight against what he calls \u201cwoke\u201d bias at cultural institutions.",

      "Last week, the Grammy-winning banjo player Bela Fleck announced that he had canceled three scheduled appearances next month with the National Symphony Orchestra, writing on social media that playing at the center had become \u201ccharged and political.\u201d Ric Grenell, a diplomat and Trump ally whom the president appointed to lead the center, wrote on X that Fleck had \u201cmade it political and caved to the woke mob.\u201d",
      "Other recent withdrawals include \u201cWicked\u201d composer Stephen Schwartz, who had been expected to host an opera gala in the spring, and the variety show Asian AF, whose shows in May were listed as canceled on the Kennedy Center website, then removed entirely. Daravi cited a \u201cscheduling conflict.\u201d A representative for Asian AF did not immediately responds to requests for comment.",

      "Harvey Weinstein is returning to a New York court",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein returns to court Thursday, seeking to get his latest sex crime conviction thrown out because anger and apprehensions flared among jurors during deliberations last spring.",
      "It's the latest convoluted turn in the former Hollywood honcho's path through the criminal justice system. His landmark #MeToo-era case has spanned seven years, trials in two states, a reversal in one and a retrial that came to a messy end in New York last year. Weinstein was convicted of forcing oral sex on one woman, acquitted of forcibly performing oral sex on another, and the jury didn't decide on a rape charge involving a third woman \u2014 a charge prosecutors vowed to retry yet again.",
      "Weinstein, 73, denies all the charges. They were one outgrowth of a stack of sexual harassment and sex assault allegations against him that emerged publicly in 2017 and ensuing years, fueling the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct. Early on, Weinstein apologized for \u201cthe way I've behaved with colleagues in the past,\u201d while also denying that he ever had non-consensual sex.",
      "At trial, Weinstein's lawyers argued that the women willingly accepted his advances in hopes of getting work in various capacities in show business, then falsely accused him to net settlement funds and attention.",
      "The split verdict last June came after multiple jurors took the unusual step of asking to brief the judge on behind-the-scenes tensions.",
      "In a series of exchanges partly in open court, one juror complained that others were \u201cshunning\u201d one of the panel members; the foreperson alluded to jurors \u201cpushing people\u201d verbally and talking about Weinstein's \u201cpast\u201d in a way the juror thought improper; yet a third juror opined that discussions were \u201cgoing well.\u201d The foreperson later came forward again to complain to the judge about being pressured to change his mind, then said he feared for his safety because a fellow panelist had said he would \u201csee me outside.\u201d The foreperson eventually refused to continue deliberating.",
      "In court, Judge Curtis Farber cited the secrecy of ongoing deliberations and reminded jurors not to disclose \u201cthe content or tenor\u201d of them. Since the trial, Weinstein's lawyers have talked with the first juror who openly complained and with another who didn't.",
      "In sworn statements, the two said they didn't believe Weinstein was guilty, but had given in because of other jurors' verbal aggression.",

      "Weinstein's lawyers contend the tensions amounted to threats that poisoned the process, and that the judge didn't look into them enough before denying the defense's repeated requests for a mistrial. Weinstein's attorneys are asking him to discard the conviction or, at least, conduct a hearing about the jury strains.",
      "Prosecutors maintain that the judge was presented with claims about \u201cscattered instances of contentious interactions\u201d and handled them appropriately. Jurors' later sworn statements are belied, prosecutors say, by other comments from one of the same jury members. He told the media right after the trial that there \u201cwas just high tension\u201d in the group.",
      "Prosecutors also said the foreperson\u2019s concerns about discussions of Weinstein\u2019s past were vague and the topic wasn\u2019t entirely off-limits. Testimony covered, for example, 2017 media reports about decades of sexual harassment allegations against him.",
      "The judge is expected to respond Thursday. He could set the conviction aside, order a hearing or let the verdict stand without any further action. Whatever he decides could be appealed.",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutors have said they're prepared to retry Weinstein on the rape charge the jury couldn't decide last spring. Currently being held in New York, he also is appealing a rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "It plays a little loose with facts but the righteous rage of \u201cDog Day Afternoon\u201d is present enough in Gus Van Sant\u2019s \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d a based-on-a-true-tale hostage thriller that\u2019s as deeply 1970s as it is contemporary.",
      "In February 1977, Tony Kiritsis walked into the Meridian Mortgage Company in downtown Indianapolis and took one of its executives, Dick Hall, hostage. Kiritsis held a sawed-off shotgun to the back of Hall's head and draped a wire around his neck that connected to the gun. If he moved too much, he would die.",
      "The subsequent standoff moved to Kiritsis\u2019 apartment and eventually concluded in a live televised news conference. The whole ordeal received some renewed attention in a 2022 podcast dramatization starring Jon Hamm.",
      "But in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire,\u201d starring Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as Kiritsis, these events are vividly brought to life by Van Sant. It\u2019s been seven years since Van Sant directed, following 2018\u2019s \u201cDon\u2019t Worry, He Won\u2019t Get Far on Foot,\u201d and one of the prevailing takeaways of his new film is that that\u2019s too long of a break for a filmmaker of Van Sant's caliber.",
      "Working from a script by Austin Kolodney, the filmmaker of \u201cMy Own Private Idaho\u201d and \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d turns \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d into not a period-piece time capsule but a bracingly relevant drama of outrage and inequality. Tony feels aggrieved by his mortgage company over a land deal the bank, he claims, blocked. We\u2019re never given many specifics, but at the same time, there\u2019s little doubt in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d that Tony\u2019s cause is just. His means might be desperate and abhorrent, but the movie is very definitely on his side.",
      "That\u2019s owed significantly to Skarsg\u00e5rd, who gives one of his finest and least adorned performances. While best known for films like \u201cIt,\u201d \u201cThe Crow\u201d and \u201cNosferatu,\u201d here Skarsg\u00e5rd has little more than some green polyester and a very \u201970s mustache to alter his looks. The straightforward, jittery intensity of his performance propels \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire.\u201d",
      "Yet Van Sant\u2019s film aspires to be a larger ensemble drama, which it only partially succeeds at. Tony\u2019s plight is far from a solitary one, as numerous threads suggest in Kolodney\u2019s fast-paced script. First and foremost is Colman Domingo as a local DJ named Fred Temple. (If ever there were an actor suited, with a smooth baritone, to play a \u201970s radio DJ, it\u2019s Domingo.) Tony, a fan, calls Fred to air his demands. But it\u2019s not just a media outlet for him. Fred touts himself as \u201cthe voice of the people.\u201d",

      "Something similar could be said of Tony, who rapidly emerges as a kind of folk hero. As much as he tortures his hostage (a very good Dacre Montgomery), he\u2019s kind to the police officers surrounding him. And as he and Dick spend more time together, Dick emerges as a kind of victim, himself. It\u2019s his father\u2019s bank, and when Tony gets M.L. Hall (Al Pacino) on the phone, he sounds painfully insensitive, sooner ready to sacrifice his son than acknowledge any wrongdoing.",
      "Pacino\u2019s presence in \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d is a nod to \u201cDog Day Afternoon,\u201d a movie that may be far better \u2014 but, then again, that\u2019s true of most films in comparison to Sidney Lumet\u2019s unsurpassed 1975 classic. Still, Van Sant\u2019s film bears some of the same rage and disillusionment with the meatgrinder of capitalism as \u201cDog Day.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s also a telling, if not entirely successful subplot of a local TV news reporter (Myha\u2019la) struggling against stereotypes. Even when she gets the goods on the unspooling news story, the way her producer says to \u201cchop it up\u201d and put it on air makes it clear: Whatever Tony is rebelling against, it\u2019s him, not his plight, that will be served up on a prime-time plate.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take recent similar cases of national fascination, such as Luigi Mangione, charged with killing a healthcare executive, to see contemporary echoes of Kiritsis' tale. The real story is more complicated and less metaphor-ready, of course, than the movie, which detracts some from the film's gritty sense of verisimilitude. Staying closer to the truth might have produced a more dynamic movie.",
      "But \u201cDead Man\u2019s Wire\u201d still works. In the film, Tony\u2019s demands are $5 million and an apology. It's clear the latter means more to him than the money. The tragedy in \u201cDead Man's Wire\u201d is just how elusive \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d can be.",

      "Some of the increase can be attributed to a change in the way viewers are counted. Nielsen began using its Big Data + Panel methodology for all events last September with the start of the current television season.",

      "Since Prime Video started to be the exclusive home of \u201cThursday Night Football\u201d in 2022, the audience has increased 60%. The first season averaged 9.58 million as audiences had to adjust to a regular package of games moving to a streaming service.",
      "Eight games this season averaged at least 15 million viewers, compared to four the first three seasons.",
      "The Denver Broncos\u2019 win over the Kansas City Chiefs on Christmas night averaged 21.06 million, breaking the network\u2019s 19.39 million mark for most-watched from the Dec. 4 game between the Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions.",

According to Nielsen, the game generated 11.7 billion viewing minutes on Nov. 27 and was the top broadcast telecast of the month. By comparison, \u201cStranger Things\u201d on Netflix totaled 11.8 billion viewing minutes across the entire month since it was available on demand.",
      "CBS' most-viewed Sunday game was what seems to be the yearly meeting between Buffalo's Josh Allen and Kansas City's Patrick Mahomes. The Bills-Chiefs matchup on Nov. 2 averaged 30.84 million.",

      "Can they do it again",
      "When we first glimpse Noah Wyle\u2019s Michael Robinavitch \u2014 aka Dr. Robby, of course \u2014 in Season 2 of \u201cThe Pitt,\u201d he\u2019s looking darned good, truth be told. The beloved ER doc is riding his motorcycle to work, wearing nice shades, hair rustling in the early-morning Pittsburgh breeze.",
      "Wait \u2014 hair rustling? It\u2019s only then we notice what\u2019s missing. Can it be that Robby \u2014 dedicated, wise, overworked, charming and brilliant \u2014 isn\u2019t wearing a helmet?",
      "It\u2019s such a jarring sight that, launching a Zoom interview with Wyle, it\u2019s one of the first things we must inquire about. Did we remember that right? Were we supposed to notice?",
      "Yes and yes. \u201cYou\u2019re supposed to notice that he doesn\u2019t wear it,\u201d Wyle confirms. \u201cBut then, he tells people that he does. Which means, you know he\u2019s lying. We don\u2019t know what else he\u2019s lying about.\u201d",
      "More broadly, it\u2019s all part of the goal this new season, after an impactful, Emmy-winning debut that culminated with a mass shooting. There were worries that they wouldn\u2019t be able to up the ante. Well, the idea is not to up the ante, Wyle says, but to more deeply explore characters and their issues.",
      "\u201cOur job isn't to come up with another stunt that creates drama to be the catalyst for excitement on the show,\u201d Wyle says. \u201cOur job is to be faithful to the characters that we\u2019ve initiated. To plot them in space and time in a real three-dimensional way, and allow their lives and what they\u2019re going through to generate the drama and the tension.\u201d",
      "Hence the no-helmet scene \u2014 a last-minute decision the night before. They'd planned for Robby to wear a helmet. But Wyle says he suggested to executive producer John Wells that if he didn\u2019t, \u201cWe won\u2019t know what to trust and what not to trust from that moment forward, and the audience will be privy to a secret that the characters around him aren\u2019t.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe dug it, so we went with that.\u201d",
      "The timing \u2013 July 4 \u2013 was hardly chosen haphazardly. Think holiday gatherings, fireworks, injuries we can imagine and worse ones we can\u2019t. But also, timing is important for the characters \u2014 it's been 10 months since last season's events.",
      "Dr. Frank Langdon has spent those months in rehab. The hard-driving senior resident with the much-noticed dimpled chin ran into serious trouble in the first season when he was caught stealing prescription meds to feed his addiction.",
      "Well, Frank\u2019s been given a reprieve, and he\u2019s on his first day back. Robby, for one, is not thrilled.",
      "But Patrick Ball, who plays Frank, is very relieved at his own reprieve. He'd been biting his nails as he awaited his character\u2019s fate.",
      "\u201cPretty much the entirety of my time on \u2018The Pitt\u2019 has been praying for a job and hoping I don\u2019t get fired,\u201d Ball quips. \u201cI was sweating pretty hard.\u201d He got the good news that he'd be back in a call from Wells, while walking on a rainy New York street.",
      "Katherine LaNasa, who plays all-knowing charge nurse Dana, had a similar sense of uncertainty. She was a breakout star of the first season, winning one of the show\u2019s five Emmys. But her character also seemed headed out the door, disillusioned by a brutal punch from an unruly patient.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m like, really, please don\u2019t get rid of me now!\u201d LaNasa says she thought. Happily, Dana too is back, taking charge as her title implies, with that sassy but maternal demeanor.",
      "\u201cI think of her as like a basketball coach,\u201d says LaNasa of Dana. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at what\u2019s going on, and what do people need to do their best? \u2026 I have children that are 24 years apart in age and so, I feel like I\u2019ve just been mothering my whole life.\u201d",

      "The comedian got the hosting gig last year after showing her skill at ruthlessly roasting celebrities. She got raves for her monologue. She brought out the knives, but they weren\u2019t overly sharp. She was promptly asked back.",
      "Sunday's monologue will be a shape-shifting monster until the moment the CBS telecast starts and she takes the stage at the Beverly Hilton, ideally with a bit ready for Roberts, who's nominated for best actress in a drama for \u201cAfter the Hunt.\u201d She'll be sitting in front of Glaser with her star-powered charm.",
      "\u201cI just want to do the perfect joke but it\u2019s like people do not have a sense of humor about Julia Roberts,\u201d Glaser said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cShe\u2019ll be fine \u2014 other people are not fine on her behalf. Like the most innocent joke about her that I made a couple times trying it out, they booed, they were like jeering.\u201d",

      "New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available",
      "WASHINGTON -- New options for testing and treating some of the most common sexually transmitted diseases are becoming available, a trend that experts hope will keep downward pressure on U.S. infection rates.",
      "Last year, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first at-home test that can detect three common infections in women \u2014 gonorrhea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis \u2014 as well as the first home-based kit for the virus that causes cervical cancer.",
      "The agency ended the year by approving two different drugs for gonorrhea, the first new options for the disease in decades.",
      "It\u2019s positive news after cases of sexually transmitted infections reached alarming highs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted screening, education and treatment for sexual health nationwide.",
      "But the pandemic years also brought positive developments for testing. The same technology used for the first over-the-counter coronavirus tests is now being translated into home-based kits for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections. Previously, the FDA had mostly limited the use of such tests to health professionals.",
      "\u201cSexual health can be stigmatized and people can be hesitant about testing,\u201d said Dr. Ina Park, a sexual health specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. \u201cNow we have a lot of options for patients who may be wary of going into a provider\u2019s office.\u201d",
      "Testing company Visby Medical launched its three-in-one test for women last year, following FDA approval in March. The urine-based test includes a vaginal testing swab and a small electronic device that develops the results and sends them to an online app for review.",
      "The test, which costs $150, also includes a telehealth consultation with a medical provider who can discuss the results and prescribe antibiotics or other medication, if needed.",
      "The entire process \u2014 from buying the test to getting a prescription \u2014 can take as little as six hours, compared with several days under the traditional testing model, says Dr. Gary Schoolnik, Visby\u2019s chief medical officer.",
      "Previously, a nurse or doctor would have to collect a sample, send it out to a lab, get the results and then schedule a follow-up appointment to discuss the results.",
      "\u201cMany patients are very hard to track down and a lot of them, if they have a positive test result, are never treated and are lost to follow-up,\u201d said Schoolnik, who is also a professor emeritus at Stanford Medical School.",
      "The FDA approved Visby\u2019s test based on study results showing that it correctly detected the three infections with accuracy rates around 98% or higher. That\u2019s similar to tests performed at hospitals and health clinics.",
      "Some home-based tests still require outside input to get the results.",
      "For example, in May the FDA approved Teal Health\u2019s testing kit for HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer. The company\u2019s Teal Wand allows women to collect their own vaginal sample, which is then placed in a tube and shipped to a laboratory for processing.",
      "Updated federal guidelines for HPV screening released earlier this month endorsed self collection for the first time.",
      "The bacteria that causes gonorrhea has constantly evolved, developing resistance to nearly every antibiotic used to treat it.",

      "\u201cWe were down to one class of antibiotics recommended to treat gonorrhea and we had no other good options,\u201d said Park. \u201cSo to have two new options in the same year is very exciting.\u201d",
      "The CDC\u2019s provisional data for 2024 showed a third consecutive year of fewer gonorrhea cases, and the second year in a row of fewer adult cases of chlamydia and the most infectious forms of syphilis.",
      "Experts point to several factors behind the trend, including less sexual activity among young people, increased use of an antibiotic as a morning-after pill to prevent infections and more at-home screening.",
      "The new tests could drive further reductions, although some experts urge caution.",
      "As more people test at home it could become harder to track national infection rates, which previously have been reported by a handful of large testing laboratories.",
      "Additionally, the new tests and drugs come with higher price tags that may limit access. For example, Visby\u2019s $150 test is not covered by insurance.",

      "LONDON -- The British government has agreed to pay a \u201csubstantial sum\u201d to settle a lawsuit by a Guantanamo Bay detainee who said U.K. intelligence agencies were complicit in his torture at secret U.S. interrogation sites, his lawyer said Monday.",
      "Abu Zubaydah was thought to be a high-ranking member of al-Qaida, the terrorist group that carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, when he was captured in Pakistan in 2002. Zubaydah, a Palestinian born in Saudi Arabia, was tortured at so-called CIA black sites abroad before being transferred to Guantanamo Bay in 2006.",
      "Attorney Helen Duffy said the confidential settlement was symbolically and practically significant for the \u201cintolerable suffering\u201d Zubaydah endured. She urged the U.K. to press for the immediate release of Zubaydah and others held without charge more than 25 years after the terror attacks.",
      "\u201cThis case is deeply relevant today, as some states ride roughshod over international law, and the world looks to others to respond,\u201d Duffy said. \u201cThere are critical lessons about the cost of cooperating with the U.S. or other allies flouting international norms. It is more important than ever that human rights and states international obligations are respected, and violations are met with reparation and accountability.\u201d",
      "The U.K. Foreign Office declined comment, saying it would neither confirm nor deny intelligence matters.",
      "Zubaydah was the first person in the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program following 9/11 and subjected to what is now widely viewed as torture. He was held at CIA black sites in Poland and Lithuania, according to the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "Zubaydah was waterboarded more than 80 times in a month at one point and confined over 11 days in a coffin-size box, among a raft of other mistreatment, a U.S. Senate report found.",

      "In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit by Zubaydah, who was seeking testimony from two former CIA contractors as part of an investigation into his treatment when he was held in Poland. The court rejected his case because the government said it would expose state secrets despite much of the information having been widely reported.",

A week ago Lee visited China, where leader Xi Jinping sought to cozy up to Seoul amid tensions between Japan and China after Takaichi said in November that potential Chinese military action against Taiwan, the island democracy Beijing claims as its own, could justify Japanese intervention.",

      "Their meeting will focus on trade and the challenges of China and North Korea.",
      "Japan and South Korea must also figure out how to deal with Trump\u2019s unpredictable diplomacy, and both countries are under U.S. pressure to increase their defense spending.",
      "During Lee\u2019s meetings in China, Xi called on the two countries to join hands, noting their historical rivalry against Japan in World War II. Lee told reporters during his China visit that \"relations with Japan are as important as those with China for us.\u201d He expressed hopes for swift resolutions of Japan-China disputes but admitted Seoul had limited capabilities to broker a reconciliation.",
      "\u201cGiven the current strategic environment, strengthening Japan-South Korea relations and reinforcing the Japan-U.S.-South Korea cooperation is more important than ever,\u201d Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi told reporters on Friday. \u201cThe Japanese and South Korean governments are on the same page about closely communicating to develop our relations stably and in a forward-looking manner.\u201d",

      "Iran had no direct reaction to Trump's comments, which came after the foreign minister of Oman \u2014 long an interlocutor between Washington and Tehran \u2014 traveled to Iran this weekend. It also remains unclear just what Iran could promise, particularly as Trump has set strict demands over its nuclear program and its ballistic missile arsenal, which Tehran insists is crucial for its national defense.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking to foreign diplomats in Tehran, insisted \u201cthe situation has come under total control\u201d in fiery remarks that blamed Israel and the U.S. for the violence, without offering evidence.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why the demonstrations turned violent and bloody to give an excuse to the American president to intervene,\u201d Araghchi said, in comments carried by the Qatar-funded Al Jazeera satellite news network.

      "Meanwhile Monday, Iran drew tens of thousands of pro-government demonstrators to head to the streets in support of the theocracy, a show of force after days of protests directly challenging the rule of 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Iranian state television aired chants from the crowd, which appeared to number in the tens of thousands, who shouted \u201cDeath to America!\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel!\u201d",

      "\u201cThe military is looking at it, and we\u2019re looking at some very strong options,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday night. Asked about Iran\u2019s threats of retaliation, he said: \u201cIf they do that, we will hit them at levels that they\u2019ve never been hit before.\u201d",
      "Trump said that his administration was in talks to set up a meeting with Tehran, but cautioned that he may have to act first as reports of the death toll in Iran mount and the government continues to arrest protesters.",

      "Iran, through the country's parliamentary speaker, warned Sunday that the U.S. military and Israel would be \u201clegitimate targets\u201d if America uses force to protect demonstrators.",
      "More than 10,600 people also have been detained over the two weeks of protests, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in previous unrest in recent years and gave the death toll. It relies on supporters in Iran crosschecking information. It said 496 of the dead were protesters and 48 were with security forces.",

      "The president\u2019s son is more powerful than ever, his allies strategically deployed in command positions across the security services. As the presumed heir to the presidency, he is the recipient of loyalty pledges from candidates seeking minor political offices.",
      "Kainerugaba joined the army in the late 1990s, and his fast rise to the top of the armed forces proved controversial.",
      "In February 2024, a month before Kainerugaba was named army chief, the president officially delegated some of his authority as commander-in-chief to the head of the military.",
      "Exercising authority previously reserved for the president, including promoting army officers of high rank and creating new army departments, Kainerugaba is more powerful than any army chief before him, said Mwambutsya Ndebesa, a political historian at Uganda\u2019s Makerere University, adding that family rule appears inevitable.",

He has said the opposition figure Kizza Besigye, jailed over alleged treason charges, should be hanged \"in broad daylight\u201d for allegedly plotting to kill Museveni.

      "President Donald Trump says Iran reached out to the U.S. and proposed negotiations after he threatened action in response to a crackdown on protesters in the Middle Eastern country",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that Iran proposed negotiations after his threat to strike the Islamic Republic over its bloody crackdown targeting demonstrators there, a move coming as activists said the death toll in protests rose to at least 544.",
      "Trump and his national security team have been weighing a range of potential responses against Iran including cyberattacks and direct strikes by the U.S. or Israel, according to two people familiar with internal White House discussions who were not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "\u201cThe military is looking at it, and we\u2019re looking at some very strong options,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday night. Asked about Iran\u2019s threats of retaliation, he said: \u201cIf they do that, we will hit them at levels that they\u2019ve never been hit before.\u201d",
      "Trump said that his administration was in talks to set up a meeting with Tehran, but cautioned that he may have to act first as reports of the death toll in Iran mount and the government continues to arrest protesters.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re tired of being beat up by the United States,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIran wants to negotiate.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThe meeting is being set up, but we may have to act because of what\u2019s happening before the meeting. But a meeting is being set up. Iran called, they want to negotiate.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate acknowledgment from Iran of the offering for a meeting. The massive ongoing U.S. military deployment to the Caribbean is a factor that the Pentagon and Trump\u2019s national security planners must consider. Tehran also warned that the U.S. military and Israel would be \u201clegitimate targets\u201d if America uses force to protect demonstrators. Trump meanwhile said the Islamic Republic reached out and proposed negotiations.",
      "More than 10,600 people also have been detained over the two weeks of protests, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in previous unrest in recent years and gave the death toll. It relies on supporters in Iran crosschecking information. It said 496 of the dead were protesters and 48 were with security forces.",
      "With the internet down in Iran and phone lines cut off, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. The Associated Press has been unable to independently assess the toll. Iran's government has not offered overall casualty figures.",
      "Those abroad fear the information blackout is emboldening hard-liners within Iran\u2019s security services to launch a bloody crackdown. Protesters flooded the streets in the country\u2019s capital and its second-largest city on Saturday night into Sunday morning. Online videos purported to show more demonstrations Sunday night into Monday, with a Tehran official acknowledging them in state media.",
      "The threat to strike the U.S. military and Israel came during a parliamentary speech by Mohammad Baagher Qalibaf, the hard-liner speaker of the body who has run for the presidency in the past.",
      "He directly threatened Israel, calling it \u201cthe occupied territory.\"",
      "\u201cIn the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\u201d Qalibaf said. \u201cWe do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\u201d",

      "LIMA, Peru -- Almost immediately after U.S. forces deposed Venezuela\u2019s president, officials from Washington to Lima, Peru, began encouraging some of the 8 million Venezuelans who have scattered themselves across the Americas over more than a decade to go home. But that idea had not even crossed the mind of Yanelis Torres.",
      "The 22-year-old graphic designer was too busy printing T-shirts with images of captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro overlaid with phrases like \u201cGame Over.\u201d Her clients in Lima\u2019s largest textile market were snatching them up within hours of the news of Maduro\u2019s downfall.",
      "Settled or undocumented, many of the millions of Venezuelans spread across Latin America received news of Maduro\u2019s capture with joy but also caution, especially after hearing U.S. President Donald Trump say that he would work with Maduro\u2019s vice president, now interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, rather than the opposition.",
      "Despite leaders in Peru and Chile echoing U.S. suggestions to return to Venezuela, the diaspora does not appear ready to do so. Venezuela\u2019s economy remains a shambles and with the exception of Maduro and his wife, the government remains in place.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of things here,\u201d Torres said from her shop in a bustling Lima neighborhood, adding it would take time for things to change in Venezuela. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep an eye on it, know what\u2019s going on, but not lose hope.\u201d",

He had spent three months in Colombia, a country overwhelmed by the numbers of arriving Venezuelans; three years in Peru, which he left during the pandemic because they wouldn\u2019t give him the vaccine; and then three more years in Chile, where he was unable to legalize his status.",
      "Finally he made the long trek through South America, the Darien jungle and up to the U.S. border just in time for Trump to close it to asylum seekers.",
      "\u201cI had plans in Europe, but if things settle down in Venezuela, I\u2019m going to Venezuela,\u201d he said. His joy at Maduro\u2019s ouster was moderated by the worries of the family he still has there over food scarcity and security forces that search people\u2019s cellphones for signs of opposition, he said.",
      "Maureen Meyer, vice president for programs at WOLA, a Washington-based human rights organization focused on Latin America, said \u201cwe\u2019re nowhere near where we\u2019re going to have a country where people that fled \u2026 feel that they could be comfortable returning.\u201d",
      "And if Venezuelans are forced to leave the countries where they are now, either under pressure or via deportation, they will be even more vulnerable to organized crime groups in the region seeking to exploit them now that the business of smuggling them north has dropped off.",

      "Angulo\u2019s release came on the third day that families had gathered outside prisons in the capital, Caracas, and other communities hoping to see loved ones walk out after Venezuela \u2019s government pledged to free what it described as a significant number of prisoners. Members of Venezuela\u2019s political opposition, activists, journalists and soldiers were among the detainees that families hoped would be released.",
      "Angulo was detained two days before the 2024 presidential election after he posted a video of an opposition demonstration in Barinas, the home state of the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. He was 17 at the time.",
      "\u201cThank God, I\u2019m going to enjoy my family again,\u201d he told The Associated Press, adding that others still detained \u201care well\u201d and have high hopes of being released soon. His faith, he said, gave him the strength to keep going during his detention.",

      "President Donald Trump has hailed the release and said it came at Washington\u2019s request.",
      "On Thursday, Venezuela \u2019s government pledged to free what it said would be a significant number of prisoners.

      "\u201cI literally could not believe it and it took some time. I actually gasped,\u201d said Jaymes Black, CEO of The Trevor Project, when they were notified of Scott's gift.",
      "Scott, whose fortune largely comes from her ex-husband Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, gave more than $7 billion to nonprofits in 2025, but this gift to The Trevor Project was not included among the donations she disclosed on her website in December. Scott previously gave The Trevor Project $6 million in 2020.",
      "In July, the Trump administration stopped providing specific support for gay, trans and gender nonconforming young people who called the 988 National Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. The Trevor Project was one of the organizations staffing that option and lost $25 million in funding, the nonprofit said.",
      "The Trevor Project continues to run an independent hotline for LGBTQ+ young people that Black said reaches about 250,000 young people annually, but they served another 250,000 callers through the 988 Press 3 option, which was tailored for LGBTQ+ young people.",
      "U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) reported more than 1.5 million contacts were routed through the service between Sept. 2022 and July 2025.",
      "The Trevor Project has gone through years of internal turmoil after exploding in size from an organization with an annual budget around $4 million in 2016 to over $83 million in 2023, according to its public tax returns. The nonprofit's board removed its CEO in 2022 and has gone through a series of layoffs, including in July. Black said the project's 2026 budget was $47 million.",

      "After it lost the 988 funding, The Trevor Project launched an emergency fundraiser that brought in $20 million to date, Black said, which they also hope Scott saw as proof that the organization was determined to stick around and make it through this period.",
      "\u201cMacKenzie Scott\u2019s folks were clear, like this gift was made for long-term impact,\u201d Black said, adding that they would take their time deciding how to use the funds.",

      "Scott has distinguished herself among the biggest individual donors by giving large, unrestricted gifts to nonprofits, often with a focus on equity or social justice. With the exception of an open call in 2023, she does not ask for project proposals nor accept applications.",
      "Despite the size of her gifts, which now often exceed the recipient organization's annual budget, research from the Center for Effective Philanthropy has found that concerns about nonprofits misusing Scott\u2019s funds or growing unsustainably have largely not been born out. That may be because Scott's team, the members of which are largely unknown, conducts extensive research on organizations before making grants.",
      "In an essay announcing her 2025 gifts, Scott said, \u201cThe potential of peaceful, non-transactional contribution has long been underestimated, often on the basis that it is not financially self-sustaining, or that some of its benefits are hard to track.

      "Blending green hydrogen with natural gas is seen by some as key to achieving California\u2019s clean energy goals",
      "Alma Figueroa began to worry when she learned that her gas provider wanted to test a controversial solution to curb global warming: blend hydrogen with natural gas to power her stove and other appliances. Figueroa, who has asthma and recently learned her lung cancer is back, worries about health risks.",
      "\u201cI don't want to be anyone's experiment,\" said Figueroa, 60, a resident of Orange Cove in California's Central Valley.",
      "The Southern California Gas Co. wants to blend and inject hydrogen into the town\u2019s gas infrastructure, after the state agency that regulates utilities directed them and other companies to launch pilot projects. Proponents see it as key to helping California reduce planet-warming pollution by curbing reliance on gas while integrating cleaner energy into existing infrastructure. It's part of a statewide effort to create safety rules for hydrogen blending. But opponents say it poses unnecessary risks, and Orange Cove's mostly Latino and low-income residents say processes are happening without transparency or their input. Projects in states such as Colorado and Oregon have also raised concerns.",
      "Interest in deploying hydrogen boomed during the Biden administration but has been hard hit with the Trump administration's cancellation of billions of dollars for hydrogen technology and other clean energy projects, including $1.2 billion for a hydrogen hub in California.",
      "The Orange Cove project is one of five proposed in California to test how gas pipelines and the appliances they fuel hold up with different amounts of hydrogen. Hawaii has been blending for decades.",
      "Natural gas is mostly methane, a potent planet-warming gas that's supercharging extreme weather worldwide, which often impacts low-income and communities of color the most.",
      "Supporters see green hydrogen as one way to cut emissions. It's made with renewable energy sources such as solar or wind to power an electrolyzer, which splits water into oxygen and hydrogen, a carbon-free gas that can be used to generate electricity and complement intermittent renewable energy. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has touted it \u201can essential aspect of how we\u2019ll power our future and cut pollution.\"",
      "Some see the 18-month proposed project in Orange Cove as one step in that direction. A solar farm would power the technology and direct the mixture, up to 5% hydrogen, to businesses and the town's roughly 10,000 residents. The estimated $64.3 million project would be paid for with ratepayer money.",
      "A Minneapolis utility company estimated a blend of up to 5% green hydrogen would reduce carbon pollution by about 1,200 tons annually, the equivalent of removing 254 gas-powered cars.",
      "Janice Lin of the Green Hydrogen Coalition said it's important to test blending. The U.S. has a vast network of gas pipelines \u2014 about 3 million miles, according to the Department of Energy \u2014 which can be used to move clean hydrogen while reducing reliance on gas, she said. If scaled, it could be cost-competitive and help industries that can't fully electrify pollute less.",
      "\u201cThe way to move us away and really clean our air and minimize our reliance on fossil fuels is by having a viable alternative,\u201d she said.",
      "California needs to demonstrate that it can blend like other countries but there are still unknowns, said Alejandra Hormaza, who teaches renewable energy at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona. The consensus is that up to 20% hydrogen by volume is safe, she said, but \u201cwe need more experimental work that uses real natural gas infrastructure to fully understand the impacts of hydrogen.\"",
      "In 2022, several gas companies filed a joint application to pursue hydrogen blending. The California Public Utilities Commission is expected to make a decision this year.",
      "SoCalGas first proposed testing hydrogen blending in facilities at the University of California, Irvine, in an affluent community. But it scaled back and revised its proposal following protests. When Orange Cove leaders expressed interest, the gas company identified the city an ideal candidate \u2014 it has various pipeline materials, including steel and polyethylene, a type of plastic, and only one gas feed coming in, allowing them ample control of the blend.",
      "Orange Cove city leaders voted unanimously in support. They did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking comment. But in an August public hearing, Mayor Diana Guerra Silva said the project would provide workforce opportunities for youth and boost business from visitors, according to a transcript.",
      "At the hearing, resident Angelica Martinez said the town could become a \u201cpioneer\u201d in hydrogen blending and \u201cdeserves the national recognition and attention for its willingness to implement such an innovative project.\u201d",

      "The push by Prime Minster Mark Carney, who arrives Wednesday, is part of a major rethink as ties sour with the United States \u2014 the world's No. 1 economy and long the largest trading partner for Canada by far.",
      "Carney aims to double Canada\u2019s non-U.S. exports in the next decade in the face of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the American leader's musing that Canada could become \u201cthe 51st state.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt a time of global trade disruption, Canada is focused on building a more competitive, sustainable, and independent economy,\u201d Carney said in a news release announcing his China visit. \u201cWe\u2019re forging new partnerships around the world to transform our economy from one that has been reliant on a single trade partner.\u201d",

The two North American nations also share a deep cultural heritage and a common geography.",
      "Carney has been in office less than a year, succeeding Justin Trudeau, who was prime minister for nearly a decade. He is not the first new leader of a country to try to repair relations with China.",
      "Australian Premier Anthony Albanese has reset ties since his Labor Party came to power in 2022. Relations had deteriorated under the previous conservative government, leading to Chinese trade restrictions on wine, beef, coal and other Australian exports. Unwinding those restrictions took about 18 months, culminating with the lifting of a Chinese ban on Australian lobsters in late 2024.",

      "It was Canada's detention of a Chinese telecommunications executive at the request of the U.S. that started the deterioration of relations in late 2018. The U.S. wanted the Huawei Technologies Co. executive, Meng Wenzhou, to be extradited to face American charges.",
      "China retaliated by arresting two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, on spying charges. While they were imprisoned, Meng was under house arrest in Vancouver, a Canadian city home to a sizable Chinese population. All three were released under a deal reached in 2021.",

      "Sand dredging is reshaping the coastline of Africa\u2019s largest city, Lagos, and driving away fish and livelihoods for some of Nigeria's poorest people",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- Beneath an eight-lane expressway, Nigerian men stand waist-deep in the Lagos Lagoon, lowering buckets into murky water. Each load brings up sand, reshaping the coastline of Africa\u2019s largest city and driving away fish and livelihoods for some of its poorest people.",
      "Not far from the bridge, wooden boats are loaded with sand. One of thousands of local dredgers, Akeem Sossu, 34, has been diving for sand for at least three years. He slips beneath the surface for about 15 seconds at a time, hauling up bucketloads bound for construction sites.",
      "Akeem said he and his partner earn about 12,000 naira ($8) each per boatload, selling to a middleman who supplies larger buyers. Filling a boat takes about three hours. Formerly a tailor, he said dredging now supports his household.",
      "\u201cI come out early, sometimes 5 a.m. or 6 a.m., depending on the tide,\u201d he said.",
      "Dredgers and local traders say the price of sand, crucial for making concrete, has risen steadily as development in Lagos has accelerated. A standard 30-ton truckload of what\u2019s known as sharp sand \u2014 coarse and gritty \u2014 now sells for about 290,000 naira, or roughly $202, reflecting strong demand.",
      "The changes to the lagoon that buffers the megacity of about 17 million people are unmistakable. What was once an open stretch of water is increasingly broken up by sandy patches, narrowing channels and reshaping currents that support thousands of fishermen.",
      "The transformation is most visible near Makoko, one of Lagos\u2019 oldest fishing communities. Dredging barges operate close to homes built on stilts, while reclaimed land and construction of upscale beachfront properties press in from the edges. Residents say the encroachment has destroyed fishing grounds and put many out of work.",
      "Nearby, fishermen wait for the day\u2019s dredging to pause. They say that when it does, even briefly, some fish return.",
      "Lagos, Nigeria\u2019s economic engine, is in constant construction. Roads, bridges and housing estates are rising daily on reclaimed waterfronts as the city's rich displace many of its poor.",
      "Over the past five years, dozens of registered dredging firms and numerous informal operators have sprung up or increased their operations, extracting sand from rivers and coastal waters across Lagos State.",
      "Industry analysts estimate the city consumes tens of millions of cubic meters of sand each year, an amount roughly equivalent to 16,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.",
      "Lagoon sand is particularly prized by builders, who say it produces stronger concrete than sand that is dredged inland.",
      "Fishermen and environmental researchers say the cost of that demand is increasingly visible in the water.",

      "\u201cAnywhere dredging is happening, there\u2019s no fish,\u201d Emmanuel said. \u201cThe noise drives them away. The places where they used to reproduce are gone.\u201d",
      "With catches shrinking, fishermen say they must travel farther offshore, increasing fuel costs and exposure to rougher seas. Some have stopped fishing altogether.",
      "\u201cWe have no other work apart from fishing,\u201d Emmanuel said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t find fish, we will starve.\u201d",
      "For some fishermen, dredging has forced an uneasy shift away from the sea. Joshua Monday said he has largely parked his two fishing boats and now works as a mechanic.",
      "He learned how to fix boat engines years ago as a backup.",
      "\u201cIf not for this mechanic work, I don\u2019t know how I would survive,\u201d he said.",

      "An autistic Barbie is joining Mattel's line of fashion dolls that's intended to celebrate diversity",
      "NEW YORK -- Mattel Inc. is introducing an autistic Barbie on Monday as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity, joining a collection that already includes Barbies with Down syndrome, a blind Barbie, a Barbie and a Ken with vitiligo, and other models the toymaker added to make its fashion dolls more inclusive.",
      "Mattel said it developed the autistic doll over more than 18 months in partnership with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates for the rights and better media representation of people with autism. The goal: to create a Barbie that reflected some of the ways autistic people may experience and process the world around them, according to a Mattel news release.",
      "That was a challenge because autism encompasses a broad range of behaviors and difficulties that vary widely in degree, and many of the traits associated with the disorder are not immediately visible, according to Noor Pervez, who is the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's community engagement manager and worked closely with Mattel on the Barbie prototype.",
      "Like many disabilities, \u201cautism doesn\u2019t look any one way,\u201d Pervez said. \u201cBut we can try and show some of the ways that autism expresses itself.\u201d",
      "For example, the eyes of the new Barbie shift slightly to the side to represent how some people with autism sometimes avoid direct eye contact, he said. The doll also was given articulated elbows and wrists to acknowledge stimming, hand flapping and other gestures that some autistic people use to process sensory information or to express excitement, according to Mattel.",
      "The development team debated whether to dress the doll in a tight or a loose-fitting outfit, Pervez said. Some autistic people wear loose clothes because they are sensitive to the feel of fabric seams, while others wear figure-hugging garments to give them a sense of where their bodies are, he said.",
      "The team ended up choosing an A-line dress with short sleeves and a flowy skirt that provides less fabric-to-skin contact. The doll also wears flat shoes to promote stability and ease of movement, according to Mattel.",

      "The addition of the autistic doll to the Barbie Fashionistas line also became an occasion for Mattel to create a doll with facial features inspired by the company\u2019s employees in India and mood boards reflecting a range of women with Indian backgrounds. Pervez said it was important to have the doll represent a segment of the autistic community that is generally underrepresented.",
      "Mattel introduced its first doll with Down syndrome in 2023 and brought out a Barbie representing a person with Type 1 diabetes last summer. The Fashionistas also include a Barbie and a Ken with a prosthetic leg, and a Barbie with hearing aids, but the line also encompasses tall, petite and curvy body types and numerous hair types and skin colors.",
      "\u201cBarbie has always strived to reflect the world kids see and the possibilities they imagine, and we\u2019re proud to introduce our first autistic Barbie as part of that ongoing work,\u201d Jamie Cygielman, Mattel\u2019s global head of dolls, said in a statement.",
      "The doll was expected to be available at Mattel's online shop and at Target stores starting Monday for a suggested retail price of $11.87. Walmart stores are expected to start carrying the new Barbie in March, Mattel said.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that the estimated prevalence of autism among 8-year-old children in the U.S. was 1 in 31. The estimate from the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network said Black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander children in the U.S. were more likely than white children to have a diagnosis, and the prevalence more than three times higher among boys than girls.",

      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Sunday the Department of Justice has served the central bank with subpoenas and threatened it with a criminal indictment over his testimony this summer about the Fed\u2019s building renovations",
      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powellsaid Sunday the Department of Justice has served the central bank with subpoenas and threatened it with a criminal indictment over his testimony this summer about the Fed's building renovations.",
      "The move represents an unprecedented escalation in President Donald Trump's battle with the Fed, an independent agency he has repeatedly attacked for not cutting its key interest rate as sharply as he prefers. The renewed fight will likely rattle financial markets Monday and could over time escalate borrowing costs for mortgages and other loans.",
      "The subpoenas relate to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June, the Fed chair said, regarding the Fed's $2.5 billion renovation of two office buildings, a project that Trump has criticized as excessive.",
      "Powell on Sunday cast off what has up to this point been a restrained approach to Trump's criticisms and personal insults, which he has mostly ignored. Instead, Powell issued a video statement in which he bluntly characterized the threat of criminal charges as simple \u201cpretexts\u201d to undermine the Fed\u2019s independence when it comes to setting interest rates.",
      "\u201cThe threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said. \u201cThis is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions \u2014 or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\u201d",
      "It's a sharp departure from the Fed's understated response to Trump this year. The central bank has attempted to placate the administration by dialing back some policies, such as efforts to consider the impact of climate change on the banking system, that the administration clearly opposed.",
      "The renewed attacks on the Fed\u2019s independence, and Powell\u2019s full-throated defense, reignite what had appeared to be a dormant battle between Trump and the chair he appointed in 2017. The subpoenas will renew fears that the Fed's independence from day-to-day politics will be compromised, which could undermine global investors' confidence in U.S. Treasury securities.",
      "\u201cWe expect the dollar, bonds and stocks to all fall in Monday trading in a sell-America trade similar to that in April last year at the peak of the tariff shock and earlier threat to Powell\u2019s position as Fed chair,\u201d Krishna Guha, an analyst at Evercore ISI, an investment bank, wrote in a note to clients.",
      "\u201cWe are stunned by this deeply disturbing development which came out of the blue after a period in which tensions between Trump and the Fed seemed to be contained,\u201d Guha added.",
      "In a brief interview with NBC News Sunday, Trump insisted he didn\u2019t know about the investigation into Powell. When asked if the investigation is intended to pressure Powell on rates, Trump said, \u201cNo. I wouldn\u2019t even think of doing it that way.\u201d",

Trump has also sought to fire Fed governor Lisa Cook, an unprecedented step, though she has sued to keep her job and courts have ruled she can remain in her seat while the case plays out. The Supreme Court will hear arguments in that case Jan. 21.",
      "At the Senate Banking Committee hearing in June, Chairman Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, said the Fed's building renovation included \u201crooftop terraces, custom elevators that open into VIP dining rooms, white marble finishes, and even a private art collection.\u201d",

      "Still, later that month, Trump visited the building site and, while standing next to Powell, overstated the cost of the renovation. Later that day, Trump, speaking to reporters, downplayed any concerns with the renovation. He said, \u201cthey have to get it done\u201d and added, \u201cLook, there\u2019s always Monday morning quarterbacks. I don\u2019t want to be that. I want to help them get it finished.\u201d",

      "A Hong Kong court is hearing arguments about the sentencing of democracy advocate Jimmy Lai",
      "HONG KONG -- A Hong Kong court heard arguments Monday about the sentencing of democracy advocate and onetime-media magnate Jimmy Lai, whose conviction under a national security law could land him in prison for the rest of his life.",
      "Lai founded the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper and was an outspoken critic of China\u2019s ruling Communist Party. He was arrested in 2020 under the law imposed by Beijing following massive anti-government protests that rocked Hong Kong the year before.",
      "In December, he was found guilty of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces and conspiracy to publish seditious articles.",
      "His conviction raised concerns about the curtailing of press freedom in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "His case could also test Beijing's diplomatic ties. The verdict drew criticism from foreign governments, including the U.S. and Britain. After the verdict, U.S. President Donald Trump, who had raised Lai\u2019s case with China, said he felt \u201cso badly.\u201d",
      "Lai, alongside other co-defendants, appeared in court for the four-day mitigation hearings. The maximum penalty is life imprisonment. Sentencing will come later.",
      "Lai\u2019s lawyer Robert Pang said his client's health, age and solitary confinement would make his sentence \u201cmore burdensome\u201d compared to that of the general prison population. Lai is 78, so the impact of a lengthy prison sentence will be greater, Pang argued.",
      "\u201cEvery day he spends in prison,\" Pang said, \u201cbrings him closer to the end of his life.\u201d",
      "When Lai entered the courtroom, he pressed his palms together, an apparent gesture to express gratitude, and smiled at those sitting in the gallery. The media tycoon appeared to be in good spirits and greeted a convicted Apple Daily editor who was also in the dock.",
      "In August, his lawyers told the court that he suffered from heart palpitations. Hong Kong\u2019s government said no abnormalities were found in a subsequent medical exam.",
      "Prosecutor Anthony Chau said Lai\u2019s health was stable. Chau said Lai had lost just 0.8 kg (about 1.8 pounds) over five years of detention, weighing 79.2 kg (about 175 pounds) when it was last measured this month. Lai is still considered obese as an Asian adult, Chau said. The obesity comment drew chuckles from some people sitting in the public gallery, and Lai also smiled.",
      "But Pang argued that his client no longer lived up to his nickname of \u201cFatty Lai,\u201d in contrast to images in videos filmed before detention and previously shown to the court.",
      "Esther Toh, one of the three government-vetted judges, rejected estimating weight by relying on human eyes, saying people may look fatter on camera. Pang also said Lai's weight once dropped 11 kg (24 pounds) within a year, though the court heard he later regained some of the weight.",
      "The lawyer said Lai suffers health issues like hypertension, diabetes and a blocked vein in one eye.",
      "Pang argued his client's solitary confinement \u2014 which Chau earlier said was at Lai's request \u2014 was making his prison life \u201charsher\u201d than others.",
      "Before sunrise, dozens of people had already lined up outside the court building to secure a seat in the public gallery. Retiree Simon Ng, a former Apple Daily reader, said he arrived and waited in line since Friday morning, hoping to see Lai.",

      "HONG KONG -- From 18th place to 140th. That's how much Hong Kong's ranking plunged in a global press freedom index over some 20 years.",
      "Behind the decline are the shutdown of pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily, more red lines for journalists and increasing self-censorship across the territory. The erosion of press freedom parallels a broader curtailment of the city's Western-style civil liberties since 2020, when Beijing imposed a national security law to eradicate challenges to its rule.",
      "Apple Daily founder Jimmy Lai was convicted in December under the security law, facing up to life in prison. Hearings began Monday for Lai and other defendants in the case to argue for a shorter sentence.",
      "His trial has been watched closely by foreign governments and political observers as a barometer of media freedom in the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. The government insists that his case has nothing to do with press freedom.",
      "Hong Kong's media environment was once freewheeling. Journalists often asked the government aggressive questions even as the owners of their outlets were pro-Beijing. News outlets regularly broke stories critical of politicians and officials.",
      "But the space for reporters has drastically narrowed after China imposed the security law, which it deemed necessary for stability after huge anti-government protests in 2019.",
      "In 2020, Lai became one of the first prominent figures charged under the law. Within a year, authorities used the same law to arrest senior executives of Apple Daily. They raided its office and froze $2.3 million of its assets, effectively forcing the newspaper to shut down in June 2021.",
      "Online news site Stand News met a similar fate in December of that year, with arrests, police raids and asset freezes forcing its shutdown. By 2022, Hong Kong had plunged 68 places to 148th in the press-freedom index compiled by media freedom organization Reporters Without Borders.",
      "In 2024, two Stand News editors became the first journalists since 1997 to be convicted of conspiracy to publish seditious articles under a separate, colonial-era law.",
      "In December, Lai was found guilty of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces and conspiracy to publish seditious articles. Six Apple Daily executives charged in the same case had entered guilty pleas, admitting they conspired with Lai to request sanctions, blockades or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.",
      "Francis Lee, a journalism and communication professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said the Apple Daily and Stand News cases indicate that some common news practices of the past are no longer permitted. The Stand News case showed that some strongly critical commentaries with relatively intense expression might be considered seditious, he said. Lai's case involved allegations of calling for foreign sanctions.",
      "\u201cMaybe some advocacy journalism was at least permitted within the legal framework back then,\" he said, referring to before the security law was introduced. \u201cToday, it\u2019s no longer allowed.\u201d",
      "Self-censorship has become more prominent, but not only because of politics. Lee said mainstream news outlets face greater pressure not to upset their vital revenue streams, including advertisers and big companies, amid a difficult business environment.",
      "Many large companies in the city value the vast mainland Chinese market and ties with the government.",
      "Finding interviewees is not easy, either. \u201cIn Hong Kong nowadays, when some topics and perspectives cannot be reported, it's not just because of media outlets practicing self-censorship,\" Lee said. \u201cNo one is willing to speak. Self-censorship is a broad social phenomenon.\"",
      "Many opposition politicians and leading activists were jailed under the security law. Dozens of civil society groups closed down. Facing potential risks, some residents also became more reluctant to talk to reporters.",
      "Hong Kong Journalists Association chairperson Selina Cheng said many stories perceived to be politically sensitive or potentially questioning the authorities are not always easily published. There is an outsized concern over including responses from the government and pro-China groups to create balance, she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Thousands of nurses at some of New York City's biggest hospitals could go on strike Monday during a severe flu season, three years after a similar walkout forced some of the same medical facilities to transfer some patients and divert ambulances.",
      "The looming strike could impact operations at several of the city\u2019s major private hospitals, including Mount Sinai in Manhattan, Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx and NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center.",
      "Nearly 15,000 nurses could walk off the job early Monday if a deal is not reached, amounting to the largest nurses strike in city history, according to Nancy Hagans, president of the New York State Nurses Association. As of Sunday morning, little progress had been made at the bargaining table, Hagans said. A vast majority of the union's nurses voted to authorize the strike last month.",
      "Like the 2023 labor fight, this year's dispute involves a complicated array of issues, claims, counterclaims and hospital-by-hospital particulars. Once again, staffing levels are a major flashpoint: Nurses say the big-budget medical centers are refusing to commit to \u2014 or even backsliding on \u2014 provisions for manageable, safe workloads.",
      "This time, the nurses' union also wants guardrails on hospitals using artificial intelligence, plus more workplace security measures. A gunman strode into Mount Sinai in November, and a man with a sharp object barricaded himself in a Brooklyn hospital room this week; both men ultimately were killed by police.",
      "The private, nonprofit hospitals involved in the current negotiations say they've made strides in staffing since 2023. Some of them suggest the union's demands, taken as a whole, are far too expensive.",
      "Scores of nurses rallied Friday in Manhattan, insisting their primary concern was proper caregiving and accusing the medical centers \u2014 whose top executives make millions of dollars a year \u2014 of greed and intransigence.",

      "Hagans, the union president, has also stressed that patients should not delay care during a potential strike.",

      "NewYork-Presbyterian said it also had arranged for temporary nurses but, if the strike happens, some patients might be moved to new rooms or advised to transfer to another facility. Montefiore posted a message assuring patients that appointments would be kept.",

Temporary nurses and even administrators with clinical backgrounds were tapped to fill in, but some patients noticed longer waits and more sparsely staffed wards.",
      "The strike ended with an agreement on raises totaling 19% over three years and staffing improvements, including the possibility of extra pay if nurses had to work short-handed.",
      "Now, the union says, the hospitals are retreating from those guarantees and falling short on other promises.",
      "Montefiore, for example, agreed to \u201cmake all reasonable efforts\u201d to stop keeping some emergency room patients in hallways while they wait for space to open up in other wards. Yet three years later, nurses still scramble to treat \u201challway patients,\u201d Montefiore intensive care nurse Michelle Gonzalez said Friday.",

      "NEW YORK -- Reviving a campaign pledge, President Donald Trump wants a one-year, 10% cap on credit card interest rates, a move that could save Americans tens of billions of dollars but drew immediate opposition from an industry that has been in his corner.",
      "Trump was not clear in his social media post Friday night whether a cap might take effect through executive action or legislation, though one Republican senator said he had spoken with the president and would work on a bill with his \u201cfull support.\u201d Trump said he hoped it would be in place Jan. 20, one year after he took office.",
      "Strong opposition is certain from Wall Street in addition to the credit card companies, which donated heavily to his 2024 campaign and have supported Trump's second-term agenda. Banks are making the argument that such a plan would most hurt poor people, at a time of economic concern, by curtailing or eliminating credit lines, driving them to high-cost alternatives like payday loans or pawnshops.",
      "\u201cWe will no longer let the American Public be ripped off by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Researchers who studied Trump\u2019s campaign pledge after it was first announced found that Americans would save roughly $100 billion in interest a year if credit card rates were capped at 10%. The same researchers found that while the credit card industry would take a major hit, it would still be profitable, although credit card rewards and other perks might be scaled back.",
      "About 195 million people in the United States had credit cards in 2024 and were assessed $160 billion in interest charges, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says. Americans are now carrying more credit card debt than ever, to the tune of about $1.23 trillion, according to figures from the New York Federal Reserve for the third quarter last year.",
      "Further, Americans are paying, on average, between 19.65% and 21.5% in interest on credit cards according to the Federal Reserve and other industry tracking sources. That has come down in the past year as the central bank lowered benchmark rates, but is near the highs since federal regulators started tracking credit card rates in the mid-1990s. That\u2019s significantly higher than a decade ago, when the average credit card interest rate was roughly 12%.",
      "The Republican administration has proved particularly friendly until now to the credit card industry.",
      "Capital One got little resistance from the White House when it finalized its purchase and merger with Discover Financial in early 2025, a deal that created the nation\u2019s largest credit card company. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is largely tasked with going after credit card companies for alleged wrongdoing, has been largely nonfunctional since Trump took office.",
      "In a joint statement, the banking industry was opposed to Trump's proposal.",
      "\u201cIf enacted, this cap would only drive consumers toward less regulated, more costly alternatives,\" the American Bankers Association and allied groups said.",
      "Bank lobbyists have long argued that lowering interest rates on their credit card products would require the banks to lend less to high-risk borrowers. When Congress enacted a cap on the fee that stores pay large banks when customers use a debit card, banks responded by removing all rewards and perks from those cards. Debit card rewards only recently have trickled back into consumers' hands. For example, United Airlines now has a debit card that gives miles with purchases.",
      "The U.S. already places interest rate caps on some financial products and for some demographics. The Military Lending Act makes it illegal to charge active-duty service members more than 36% for any financial product. The national regulator for credit unions has capped interest rates on credit union credit cards at 18%.",

The argument from some researchers and left-leaning policymakers is that the banks earn enough revenue from merchants to keep them profitable if interest rates were capped.",
      "\"A 10% credit card interest cap would save Americans $100 billion a year without causing massive account closures, as banks claim. That\u2019s because the few large banks that dominate the credit card market are making absolutely massive profits on customers at all income levels,\" said Brian Shearer, director of competition and regulatory policy at the Vanderbilt Policy Accelerator, who wrote the research on the industry's impact of Trump's proposal last year.",
      "There are some historic examples that interest rate caps do cut off the less creditworthy to financial products because banks are not able to price risk correctly. Arkansas has a strictly enforced interest rate cap of 17% and evidence points to the poor and less creditworthy being cut out of consumer credit markets in the state. Shearer's research showed that an interest rate cap of 10% would likely result in banks lending less to those with credit scores below 600.",

      "\u201cNext week\u2019s elections in Uganda will take place in an environment marked by widespread repression and intimidation against the political opposition, human rights defenders, journalists and those with dissenting views,\u201d OHCHR said.",
      "Ugandan police, the military and others have used live ammunition to disperse peaceful assemblies, and the security forces have often used unmarked vans known locally as \u201cdrones\u201d to abduct opposition party supporters, the report said.",
      "\u201cThe Ugandan authorities must ensure all Ugandans can participate fully and safely in the election, as is their right under international law,\u201d Volker T\u00fcrk, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, said in a statement. \u201cThey must, among others, ensure that no unnecessary or disproportionate force, including lethal force, is used to disperse peaceful protests.\u201d",
      "Police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on allegations in the U.N. report.",
      "The report also cites the ongoing detention of opposition figure Kizza Besigye, who is accused of treason, and Sarah Bireete, a prominent civic leader who is accused of obtaining unlawful access to the national voters' registry. Both are detained in a maximum security prison in Kampala, the Ugandan capital.",
      "Bireete runs the Center for Constitutional Governance, a nongovernmental organization in Kampala.",
      "Before she was arrested on Dec. 30, Bireete had been a frequent guest on local television stations and was active on X. She had also spoken to The Associated Press before she was arrested, saying in the interview that Museveni\u2019s Uganda was \u201ca military dictatorship\u201d pretending to be a democracy.",

      "The authoritarian Museveni first took power by force as the leader of a guerrilla force fighting for democratic rule after a period of political instability and the cruel dictatorship of Idi Amin. Museveni has kept power since 1986 by repeatedly rewriting the rules. Term and age limits have been scrapped, rivals jailed or sidelined, and state security forces are a constant presence at opposition rallies.",

    "story": [
      "Iran's judiciary chief has vowed decisive punishment for protesters, signaling a coming crackdown against demonstrations",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran signaled Friday that security forces would crack down on protesters, directly challenging U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to support those peacefully demonstrating as the death toll rose to at least 50.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed Trump as having hands \u201cstained with the blood of Iranians\u201d as supporters shouted \u201cDeath to America!\u201d in footage aired by Iranian state television. State media later repeatedly referred to demonstrators as \u201cterrorists,\u201d setting the stage for a violent crackdown like those that followed other nationwide protests in recent years.",
      "Protesters are \u201cruining their own streets ... in order to please the president of the United States,\u201d Khamenei said to a crowd at his compound in Tehran. \u201cBecause he said that he would come to their aid. He should pay attention to the state of his own country instead.\u201d",
      "Iran\u2019s judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately vowed that punishment for protesters \u201cwill be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate response from Washington, though Trump has repeated his pledge to strike Iran if protesters are killed, a threat that's taken on greater significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuela's Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Despite Iran\u2019s theocracy cutting off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls, short online videos shared by activists purported to show protesters chanting against Iran\u2019s government around bonfires as debris littered the streets in the capital, Tehran, and other areas into Friday morning.",
      "Iranian state media alleged \u201cterrorist agents\u201d of the U.S. and Israel set fires and sparked violence. It also said there were \u201ccasualties,\u201d without elaborating.",
      "The full scope of the demonstrations couldn\u2019t be immediately determined due to the communications blackout, though it represented yet another escalation in protests that began over Iran\u2019s ailing economy and that has morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in several years. The protests have intensified steadily since beginning Dec. 28.",
      "The protests also represented the first test of whether the Iranian public could be swayed by Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose fatally ill father fled Iran just before the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution. Pahlavi, who called for the protests Thursday night, similarly has called for demonstrations at 8 p.m. Friday.",
      "Demonstrations have included cries in support of the shah, something that could bring a death sentence in the past but now underlines the anger fueling the protests that began over Iran\u2019s ailing economy.",
      "So far, violence around the demonstrations has killed at least 50 people while more than 2,270 others have been detained, said the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "\u201cWhat turned the tide of the protests was former Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi\u2019s calls for Iranians to take to the streets at 8 p.m. on Thursday and Friday,\u201d said Holly Dagres, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \u201cPer social media posts, it became clear that Iranians had delivered and were taking the call seriously to protest in order to oust the Islamic Republic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is exactly why the internet was shut down: to prevent the world from seeing the protests. Unfortunately, it also likely provided cover for security forces to kill protesters.\u201d",
      "When the clock struck 8 p.m. Thursday, neighborhoods across Tehran erupted in chanting, witnesses said. The chants included \u201cDeath to the dictator!\u201d and \u201cDeath to the Islamic Republic!\u201d Others praised the shah, shouting: \u201cThis is the last battle! Pahlavi will return!\u201d Thousands could be seen on the streets before all communication to Iran cut out.",
      "\u201cIranians demanded their freedom tonight. In response, the regime in Iran has cut all lines of communication,\u201d Pahlavi said. \u201cIt has shut down the internet. It has cut landlines. It may even attempt to jam satellite signals.\u201d",
      "He went on to call for European leaders to join Trump in promising to \u201chold the regime to account.\u201d",

      "Pahlavi had said he would offer further plans depending on the response to his call. His support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past \u2014 particularly after the 12-day war Israel waged on Iran in June. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some demonstrations, but it isn\u2019t clear whether that\u2019s support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "The internet cut also appears to have taken Iran\u2019s state-run and semiofficial news agencies offline. The state TV acknowledgment at 8 a.m. Friday represented the first official word about the demonstrations.",
      "State TV claimed the protests were violent and caused casualties, but did not elaborate. It also said the protests saw \u201cpeople\u2019s private cars, motorcycles, public places such as the metro, fire trucks and buses set on fire.\u201d State TV later reported that violence overnight killed six people in Hamedan, some 280 kilometers (175 miles) southwest of Tehran.",
      "The European Union and Germany condemned the violence targeting demonstrators.",
      "Iran has faced rounds of nationwide protests in recent years. As sanctions tightened and Iran struggled after the 12-day war, its rial currency collapsed in December, reaching 1.4 million to $1. Protests began soon after, with demonstrators chanting against Iran\u2019s theocracy.",
      "It remains unclear why Iranian officials have yet to crack down harder on the demonstrators. Trump warned last week that if Tehran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters,\u201d America \u201cwill come to their rescue.\u201d",
      "In an interview with talk show host Hugh Hewitt aired Thursday, Trump reiterated his pledge.",
      "Iran has \u201cbeen told very strongly, even more strongly than I\u2019m speaking to you right now, that if they do that, they\u2019re going to have to pay hell,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He demurred when asked if he\u2019d meet with Pahlavi.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure that it would be appropriate at this point to do that as president,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think that we should let everybody go out there, and we see who emerges.\u201d",
      "Speaking in an interview with Sean Hannity aired Thursday night on Fox News, Trump went as far as to suggest 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei may be looking to leave Iran.",
      "\u201cHe's looking to go someplace,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt's getting very bad.\u201d",

      "Now, the three-time heavyweight champion's quip is becoming reality.",
      "Widely regarded as the most famous and influential boxer of all time, and a cultural force who fused athletic brilliance with political conviction and showmanship, Ali is being honored for the first time with a commemorative U.S. postage stamp.",
      "\u201cAs sort of the guardian of his legacy, I\u2019m thrilled. I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m ecstatic,\u201d Lonnie Ali, the champ's wife of nearly 30 years, told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause people, every time they look at that stamp, they will remember him. And he will be in the forefront of their consciousness. And, for me, that's a thrill.\u201d",
      "Muhammad Ali died in 2016 at the age of 74 after living with Parkinson's disease for more than three decades. During his lifetime and posthumously, the man known as The Greatest has received numerous awards, including an Olympic gold medal in 1960, the United Nations Messenger of Peace award in 1998 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005.",
      "Having his face on a stamp, Lonnie Ali said, has a particular significance because it's a chance to highlight his mission of spreading compassion and his ability to connect with people.",
      "\u201cHe did it one person at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that's such a lovely way to connect with people, to send them a letter and to use this stamp to reinforce the messaging in that life of connection.\u201d",
      "A first-day-of-issue ceremony for the Muhammad Ali Forever Stamp is planned for Thursday in Louisville, Kentucky, the birthplace of the famed boxer and home to the Muhammad Ali Center, which showcases his life and legacy. That's when people can buy Muhammad Ali Forever Stamps featuring a black-and-white Associated Press photo from 1974 of Ali in his famous boxing pose.",
      "Each sheet of 20 stamps also features a photo of Ali posing in a pinstripe suit, a recognition of his work as an activist and humanitarian. Twenty-two million stamps have been printed. Once they sell out, they won't be reprinted, U.S. Postal Service officials said. The stamps are expected to generate a lot of interest from collectors and noncollectors.",
      "Because they're Forever Stamps, the First-Class Mail postage will always remain valid, which Lonnie Ali calls an \u201cultimate\u201d tribute.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a Forever Stamp from the post office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's just one of those things that will be part of his legacy, and it will be one of the shining stars of his legacy, getting this stamp.\u201d",
      "Lisa Bobb-Semple, the USPS director of stamp services, said the idea for a Muhammad Ali stamp first came about shortly after his death almost a decade ago. But the process of developing a stamp is a long one. The USPS requires people who appear on stamps to be dead for at least three years, with the exception of presidents.",
      "As the USPS was working behind the scenes on a stamp, a friend of Ali helped to launch the #GetTheChampAStamp campaign, which sparked public interest in the idea.",

      "\u201cWe are really excited that the stars were able to align that allowed us to bring the stamp to fruition,\u201d said Bobb-Semple, who initially had to keep the planned Ali stamp secret until it was official. \u201cIt\u2019s one that we\u2019ve always wanted to bring to the market.\u201d",
      "Members of the Citizen Stamps Advisory Committee, appointed by the postmaster general, are responsible for selecting who and what appears on stamps. Each quarter, they meet with Bobb-Semple and her team to review suggestions submitted by the public. There are usually about 20 to 25 commemorative stamp issues each year.",
      "Once a stamp idea is selected, Bobb-Semple and her team work with one of several art directors to design the postage. It then goes through a lengthy final approval process, including a rigorous review by the USPS legal staff, before it can be issued to the public.",
      "Antonio Alcal\u00e1, art director and designer of the Muhammad Ali stamp, said hundreds of images were reviewed before the final choices were narrowed to a few. Finally, the AP image, taken by an unnamed photographer, was chosen. It shows Ali in his prime, posing with boxing gloves and looking straight into the camera.",
      "Alcal\u00e1 said there's a story behind every USPS stamp.",
      "\u201cPostage stamps are miniature works of art designed to reflect the American experience, highlight heroes, history, milestones, achievements and natural wonders of America,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Muhammad Ali stamps are a great example of that.\u201d",
      "Beyond the boxing ring, Ali was outspoken about his beliefs when many Black Americans were still fighting to be heard. Born Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name after converting to Islam in the 1960s and spoke openly about race, religion and war. In 1967, he refused to be inducted into the U.S. Army, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War.",
      "That stance cost Ali his heavyweight championship title and barred him from boxing for more than three years. Convicted of draft evasion, he was sentenced to five years in prison but remained free while appealing the case. The conviction was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971, further cementing his prominence as a worldwide figure.",
      "Later in life, Ali emerged as a global humanitarian and used his fame to promote peace, religious understanding and charitable causes, even as Parkinson\u2019s disease limited his speech and movement.",
      "The commemorative postage stamp comes at a time of political division in the U.S. and the world. Lonnie Ali said if her husband were alive today, he'd probably \u201cblock a lot of this out\u201d and continue to be a compassionate person who connects with people every day.",
      "That approach, she said, is especially important now.",
      "\u201cWe have to mobilize Muhammad\u2019s life and sort of engage in the same kinds of acts of kindness and compassion that he did every day,\u201d she said.",

      "Olympic officials have brought on ice master Mark Messer to prepare the speed skating rink for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games",
      "RHO, Italy -- No ice is colder and harder than speedskating ice. The precision it takes has meant that Olympic speedskaters have never competed for gold on a temporary indoor rink \u2013 until the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.",
      "In the pursuit of maximum glide and minimum friction, Olympic officials brought on ice master Mark Messer, a veteran of six previous Olympic speedskating tracks and the ice technician in charge of the Olympic Oval in Calgary, Canada \u2014 one of the fastest tracks in the world with over 300 records.",
      "Messer has been putting that experience to work one thin layer of ice at a time since the end of October at the new Speed Skating Stadium, built inside adjacent trade fair halls in the city of Rho just north of Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve had in icemaking,\u2019\u2019 Messer said during an interview less than two weeks into the process.",
      "If Goldilocks were a speedskater, hockey ice would be medium hard, for fast puck movement and sharp turns. Figure skating ice would be softer, allowing push off for jumps and so the ice doesn\u2019t shatter on landing. Curling ice is the softest and warmest of all, for controlled sliding.",
      "For speedskating ice to be just right, it must be hard, cold and clean. And very, very smooth.",
      "\u201cThe blades are so sharp, that if there is some dirt, the blade will lose the edge,\u2019\u2019 Messer said, and the skater will lose speed.",
      "Speedskater Enrico Fabris, who won two Olympic golds in Turin in 2006, has traded in his skates to be deputy sports manager at the speedskating venue in Rho. For him, perfect ice means the conditions are the same for all skaters \u2014 and then if it's fast ice, so much the better.",
      "\"It's more of a pleasure to skate on this ice,'' he said.",
      "Messer\u2019s first Olympics were in Calgary in 1988 \u2014 the first time speedskating was held indoors. \u201cThat gave us some advantages because we didn\u2019t have to worry about the weather, wind blowing or rain,\u2019\u2019 he said. Now he is upping the challenge by becoming the first ice master to build a temporary rink for the Olympics.",
      "Before Messer arrived in Italy, workers spent weeks setting up insulation to level the floor and then a network of pipes and rubber tubes that carry glycol \u2014 an antifreeze \u2014 that is brought down to minus 7 or minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 to 19.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to make the ice.",
      "Water is run through a purification system \u2014 but it can\u2019t be too pure, or the ice that forms will be too brittle. Just the right amount of impurities \u201cholds the ice together,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The first layers of water are applied slowly, with a spray nozzle; after the ice reaches a few centimeters it is painted white \u2014 a full day\u2019s work \u2014 and the stripes are added to make lanes.",
      "\u201cThe first one takes about 45 minutes. And then as soon as it freezes, we go back and do it again, and again and again. So we do it hundreds of times,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "As the ice gets thicker, and is more stable, workers apply subsequent layers of water with hoses. Messer attaches his hose to hockey sticks for easier spreading.",
      "What must absolutely be avoided is dirt, dust or frost \u2014 all of which can cause friction for the skaters, slowing them down. The goal is that when the skaters push \u201cthey can go as far as possible with the least amount of effort,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The Zamboni ice resurfacing machine plays a key role in keeping the track clean, cutting off a layer and spraying water to make a new surface.",
      "One challenge is gauging how quickly the water from the resurfacing machine freezes in the temporary rink.",
      "Another is getting the ice to the right thickness so that the Zamboni, weighing in at six tons, doesn\u2019t shift the insulation, rubber tubing or ice itself.",
      "\u201cWhen you drive that out, if there\u2019s anything moving it will move. We don\u2019t want that,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The rink got its first big test on Nov. 29-30 during a Junior World Cup event. In a permanent rink, test events are usually held a year before the Olympics, leaving more time for adjustments. \u201cWe have a very small window to learn,\u2019\u2019 Messer acknowledged.",
      "Dutch speedskater Kayo Vos, who won the men\u2019s neo-senior 1,000 meters, said the ice was a little soft \u2014 but Messer didn\u2019t seem too concerned.",
      "\u201cWe went very modest to start, now we can start to change the temperatures and try to make it faster and still maintain it as a safe ice,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Fine-tuning the air temperature and humidity and ice temperature must be done methodically \u2014 taking into account that there will be 6,000 spectators in the venue for each event. The next real test will be on Jan. 31, when the Olympians take to the ice for their first training session.",
      "\u201cEighty percent of the work is done but the hardest part is the last 20 percent, where we have to try to find the values and the way of running the equipment so all the skaters get the same conditions and all the skaters get the best conditions,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "The NFL won\u2019t have a repeat Super Bowl champion.",
      "Jalen Hurts, Saquon Barkley and the Philadelphia Eagles were eliminated by the San Francisco 49ers in an NFC wild-card game on Sunday.",
      "Now, the heat will be turned up on coach Nick Sirianni and offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo.",
      "Sirianni\u2019s job shouldn\u2019t be in jeopardy. He\u2019s been a winner since he arrived in Philly in 2021. Five playoff appearances, three division titles, two Super Bowl appearances and one Lombardi trophy in five seasons.",
      "But there will be accountability for a stagnant offense that plagued Philadelphia throughout the season and showed up again in a one-and-done performance.",
      "Patullo is the likely scapegoat though there\u2019s plenty of blame to spread around.",
      "\u201cThere will be time to evaluate everybody\u2019s performance,\u201d Sirianni said. \u201cRight now, I feel for all our guys in the locker room, all the players, all the coaches, the front office, everybody that works so hard, the fans that come out and support us, Mr. (chairman/CEO Jeffrey) Lurie. I feel for all of us, all of them, and there\u2019ll be time to evaluate everything coming up.\u201d",
      "The Eagles managed just 19 points and 307 yards facing a defense missing its two best players: five-time Pro Bowl edge rusher Nick Bosa and four-time All-Pro linebacker Fred Warner, among others.",
      "Hurts couldn\u2019t get on track despite an effective run game. Barkley had 106 yards rushing on 26 carries but his success didn\u2019t open things up for the passing attack. Hurts was 20 of 35 for 168 yards with one touchdown. A.J. Brown caught only three of seven targets for 25 yards.",
      "The final sequence summed up the team\u2019s struggles.",
      "Down 23-19, Hurts completed five of his first six passes to move from Philadelphia\u2019s 35 to San Francisco\u2019s 20. After he took a sack, the Eagles faced a second-and-11 with just under one minute to go.",
      "Hurts scrambled out of the pocket and threw incomplete. Fox analyst Tom Brady, who has been one of Hurts\u2019 biggest supporters, questioned his decision. Brady said the \u201cpocket was perfect\u201d but Hurts got \u201cantsy\u201d and escaped, taking away half the field. The seven-time Super Bowl champion added that has been a tendency for Hurts.",
      "On third down, Hurts again threw incomplete. On fourth down, the play call was questionable. Four receivers ran vertical routes against a four-corner defense that\u2019s designed to take that away. Hurts threw incomplete into double coverage, ending Philadelphia\u2019s bid to follow up Kansas City\u2019s repeat with another one.",
      "Patullo followed Sirianni from Indianapolis to Philadelphia and was promoted from pass game coordinator and associate head coach after Kellen Moore left for New Orleans. The Eagles (11-7) dropped from eighth in total yards to 24th and from seventh in scoring to 19th.",
      "Shane Steichen was Sirianni\u2019s offensive coordinator the first two seasons. After he left for Indianapolis, Brian Johnson took over and was fired after one season. Moore came in after spending serving as the OC for the Chargers and Cowboys. Expect Sirianni to look outside the organization if Philadelphia makes a change.",
      "\u201cAnytime you lose, anytime you don\u2019t perform the way you want to as coaches and players, yeah, you\u2019re frustrated,\u201d Sirianni said. What I said to the guys is: \u2018Adversity shapes you to who you are if you allow it to.\u2019 There\u2019s a lot to be thankful for, but you\u2019ve got to use this adversity to shape you and that\u2019s for everybody in that locker room: myself, the coaches, the players. Let the pain shape you to what you want to be, and we will use this like we used it at the end of \u201922, \u201823 because all that was necessary for \u201924. We\u2019ll see what the future holds.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Olympic officials have brought on ice master Mark Messer to prepare the speed skating rink for the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games",
      "RHO, Italy -- No ice is colder and harder than speedskating ice. The precision it takes has meant that Olympic speedskaters have never competed for gold on a temporary indoor rink \u2013 until the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Games.",
      "In the pursuit of maximum glide and minimum friction, Olympic officials brought on ice master Mark Messer, a veteran of six previous Olympic speedskating tracks and the ice technician in charge of the Olympic Oval in Calgary, Canada \u2014 one of the fastest tracks in the world with over 300 records.",
      "Messer has been putting that experience to work one thin layer of ice at a time since the end of October at the new Speed Skating Stadium, built inside adjacent trade fair halls in the city of Rho just north of Milan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the biggest challenges I\u2019ve had in icemaking,\u2019\u2019 Messer said during an interview less than two weeks into the process.",
      "If Goldilocks were a speedskater, hockey ice would be medium hard, for fast puck movement and sharp turns. Figure skating ice would be softer, allowing push off for jumps and so the ice doesn\u2019t shatter on landing. Curling ice is the softest and warmest of all, for controlled sliding.",
      "For speedskating ice to be just right, it must be hard, cold and clean. And very, very smooth.",
      "\u201cThe blades are so sharp, that if there is some dirt, the blade will lose the edge,\u2019\u2019 Messer said, and the skater will lose speed.",
      "Speedskater Enrico Fabris, who won two Olympic golds in Turin in 2006, has traded in his skates to be deputy sports manager at the speedskating venue in Rho. For him, perfect ice means the conditions are the same for all skaters \u2014 and then if it's fast ice, so much the better.",
      "\"It's more of a pleasure to skate on this ice,'' he said.",
      "Messer\u2019s first Olympics were in Calgary in 1988 \u2014 the first time speedskating was held indoors. \u201cThat gave us some advantages because we didn\u2019t have to worry about the weather, wind blowing or rain,\u2019\u2019 he said. Now he is upping the challenge by becoming the first ice master to build a temporary rink for the Olympics.",
      "Before Messer arrived in Italy, workers spent weeks setting up insulation to level the floor and then a network of pipes and rubber tubes that carry glycol \u2014 an antifreeze \u2014 that is brought down to minus 7 or minus 8 degrees Celsius (17.6 to 19.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to make the ice.",
      "Water is run through a purification system \u2014 but it can\u2019t be too pure, or the ice that forms will be too brittle. Just the right amount of impurities \u201cholds the ice together,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The first layers of water are applied slowly, with a spray nozzle; after the ice reaches a few centimeters it is painted white \u2014 a full day\u2019s work \u2014 and the stripes are added to make lanes.",
      "\u201cThe first one takes about 45 minutes. And then as soon as it freezes, we go back and do it again, and again and again. So we do it hundreds of times,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "As the ice gets thicker, and is more stable, workers apply subsequent layers of water with hoses. Messer attaches his hose to hockey sticks for easier spreading.",
      "What must absolutely be avoided is dirt, dust or frost \u2014 all of which can cause friction for the skaters, slowing them down. The goal is that when the skaters push \u201cthey can go as far as possible with the least amount of effort,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The Zamboni ice resurfacing machine plays a key role in keeping the track clean, cutting off a layer and spraying water to make a new surface.",
      "One challenge is gauging how quickly the water from the resurfacing machine freezes in the temporary rink.",
      "Another is getting the ice to the right thickness so that the Zamboni, weighing in at six tons, doesn\u2019t shift the insulation, rubber tubing or ice itself.",
      "\u201cWhen you drive that out, if there\u2019s anything moving it will move. We don\u2019t want that,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",
      "The rink got its first big test on Nov. 29-30 during a Junior World Cup event. In a permanent rink, test events are usually held a year before the Olympics, leaving more time for adjustments. \u201cWe have a very small window to learn,\u2019\u2019 Messer acknowledged.",
      "Dutch speedskater Kayo Vos, who won the men\u2019s neo-senior 1,000 meters, said the ice was a little soft \u2014 but Messer didn\u2019t seem too concerned.",
      "\u201cWe went very modest to start, now we can start to change the temperatures and try to make it faster and still maintain it as a safe ice,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Fine-tuning the air temperature and humidity and ice temperature must be done methodically \u2014 taking into account that there will be 6,000 spectators in the venue for each event. The next real test will be on Jan. 31, when the Olympians take to the ice for their first training session.",
      "\u201cEighty percent of the work is done but the hardest part is the last 20 percent, where we have to try to find the values and the way of running the equipment so all the skaters get the same conditions and all the skaters get the best conditions,\u2019\u2019 Messer said.",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysia and Indonesia have become the first countries to block Grok, the artificial intelligence chatbot developed by Elon Musk\u2019s xAI, after authorities said it was being misused to generate sexually explicit and non-consensual images.",
      "The moves reflect growing global concern over generative AI tools that can produce realistic images, sound and text, while existing safeguards fail to prevent their abuse. The Grok chatbot, which is accessed through Musk\u2019s social media platform X, has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",
      "Regulators in the two Southeast Asian nations said existing controls were not preventing the creation and spread of fake pornographic content, particularly involving women and minors. Indonesia\u2019s government temporarily blocked access to Grok on Saturday, followed by Malaysia on Sunday.",
      "\"The government sees non-consensual sexual deepfakes as a serious violation of human rights, dignity and the safety of citizens in the digital space,\u201d Indonesia\u2019s Communication and Digital Affairs Minister Meutya Hafid said in a statement Saturday.",
      "The ministry said the measure was intended to protect women, children and the broader community from fake pornographic content generated using AI.",
      "Initial findings showed that Grok lacks effective safeguards to stop users from creating and distributing pornographic content based on real photos of Indonesian residents, Alexander Sabar, director general of digital space supervision, said in a separate statement. He said such practices risk violating privacy and image rights when photos are manipulated or shared without consent, causing psychological, social and reputational harm.",
      "In Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission ordered a temporary restriction on Grok on Sunday after what it said was \u201crepeated misuse\u201d of the tool to generate obscene, sexually explicit and non-consensual manipulated images, including content involving women and minors.",

      "Launched in 2023, Grok is free to use on X. Users can ask it questions on the social media platform and tag posts they\u2019ve directly created or replies to posts from other users.

      "An attempt by The Associated Press to request a comment through email to xAI resulted in an automated reply from the media support email address which stated, \u201cLegacy Media Lies.\u201d This was the same message received from a different email when asked for comment regarding the global backlash.",

      "The news was announced on the first day of the National Retail Federation\u2019s annual convention in New York, which is expected to draw 40,000 attendees from retail and technology companies this week.

      "\u201cThe transition from traditional web or app search to agent-led commerce represents the next great evolution in retail,\" John Furner, Walmart's incoming president and CEO, said in a joint statement with Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichaei.",

      "Von D\u00e4niken's representatives announced on his website on Sunday that he had died the previous day in a hospital in central Switzerland. His daughter Cornelia confirmed the information to Swiss news agency SDA.",
      "Von D\u00e4niken rose to prominence in 1968 with the publication of his first book \"Chariots of the Gods,\" in which he claimed that the Mayans and ancient Egyptians were visited by alien astronauts and instructed in advanced technology that allowed them to build giant pyramids.",
      "The book fueled a growing interest in unexplained phenomena at a time when thanks to conventional science man was about to take its first steps on the Moon.",
      "\"Chariots of the Gods\" was followed by more than two dozen similar books that sold 60 million copies in 32 languages, spawning a literary niche in which fact and fantasy were mixed together against all historical and scientific evidence.",
      "While von D\u00e4niken managed to shrug off his many critics, the former hotel waiter had a troubled relationship with money throughout his life and frequently came close to financial ruin.",
      "Born in 1935, the son of a clothing manufacturer in the northern Swiss town of Schaffhausen, von D\u00e4niken is said to have rebelled against his father's strict Catholicism and the priests who instructed him at boarding school by developing his own alternatives to the biblical account of the origins of life.",
      "After leaving school in 1954, von D\u00e4niken worked as a waiter and barkeeper for several years, during which he was repeatedly accused of fraud and served a couple of short stints in prison.",
      "In 1964, he was appointed manager of a hotel in the exclusive resort town of Davos and began writing his first book. Its publication and rapid commercial success were quickly followed by accusations of tax dodging and financial impropriety, for which he again spent time behind bars.",
      "By the time he left prison, \"Chariots of the Gods\" was earning von D\u00e4niken a fortune and a second book \"Gods from Outer Space\" was ready for publication, allowing him to commit himself to his paranormal passion and travel the world in search of new mysteries to uncover.",

      "Although his popularity was waning in the English-speaking world by the 1980s, von D\u00e4niken's books and films influenced a wave of semi-serious archaeological documentaries and numerous popular television shows, including \"The X-Files,\" which featured two FBI agents tasked with solving paranormal mysteries.",
      "His last major venture, a theme park based on his books, failed after just a few years due to lack of interest.

    "story": [
      "Doctors fear this week\u2019s unprecedented changes to federal vaccine recommendations will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents and ultimately lead to more illness and death among children",
      "Dr. Molly O\u2019Shea has noticed growing skepticism about vaccines at both of her Michigan pediatric offices and says this week's unprecedented and confusing changes to federal vaccine guidance will only make things worse.",
      "One of her offices is in a Democratic area, where more of the parents she sees are opting for alternative schedules that spread out shots. The other is in a Republican area, where some parents have stopped immunizing their children altogether.",
      "She and other doctors fear the new recommendations and the terminology around them will stoke vaccine hesitancy even more, pose challenges for pediatricians and parents that make it harder for kids to get shots, and ultimately lead to more illness and death.",
      "The biggest change was to stop blanket recommendations for protection against six diseases and recommend those vaccines only for at-risk children or through something called \u201cshared clinical decision-making\u201d with a health care provider.",
      "The phrase, experts say, is confusing and dangerous: \u201cIt sends a message to a parent that actually there\u2019s only a rarefied group of people who really need the vaccine,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s creating an environment that puts a sense of uncertainty about the value and necessity or importance of the vaccines in that category.\u201d",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who helped lead the anti-vaccine movement for years, said in announcing the changes that they better align the U.S. with peer nations \u201cwhile strengthening transparency and informed consent.\u201d",
      "But doctors say they are sowing doubt \u2014 the vaccines have been extensively studied and proven to be safe and effective at shielding kids from nasty diseases \u2014 at a time when childhood vaccination rates are already falling and some of those infectious diseases are spreading.",
      "On Friday, the American Academy of Pediatrics and more than 200 medical, public health and patient advocacy groups sent a letter to Congress about the new childhood immunization schedule.",
      "\u201cWe urge you to investigate why the schedule was changed, why credible scientific evidence was ignored, and why the committee charged with advising the HHS Secretary on immunizations did not discuss the schedule changes as a part of their public meeting process,\" they wrote.",
      "O\u2019Shea said she and other pediatricians discuss vaccines with parents at every visit where they are given. But that\u2019s not necessarily \u201cshared clinical decision-making,\u201d which has a particular definition.",
      "On its website, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices says: \u201cUnlike routine, catch-up, and risk-based recommendations, shared clinical decision-making vaccinations are not recommended for everyone in a particular age group or everyone in an identifiable risk group. Rather, shared clinical decision-making recommendations are individually based and informed by a decision process between the health care provider and the patient or parent/guardian.\u201d",
      "In this context, health care providers include primary care physicians, specialists, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, registered nurses and pharmacists.",
      "A pair of surveys conducted last year by the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania suggested that many people don\u2019t fully understand the concept, which came up last year when the federal government changed recommendations around COVID-19 vaccinations.",
      "Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults knew that one meaning behind shared decision-making is that \u201ctaking the vaccine may not be a good idea for everyone but would benefit some.\u201d And only about one-third realized pharmacists count as health care providers to talk with during the process, even though they frequently administer vaccines.",
      "As of this week, vaccines that protect against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, rotavirus, RSV, flu and meningococcal disease are no longer universally recommended for kids. RSV, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended for certain high-risk populations; flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B and meningococcal vaccines are recommended through shared decision-making \u2014 as is the COVID-19 vaccine, although that change was made last year.",
      "Shortly after the federal announcement Monday, Dr. Steven Abelowitz heard from half a dozen parents. \u201cIt\u2019s causing concern for us, but more importantly, concern for parents with kids, especially young kids, and confusion,\u201d said Abelowitz, founder of Ocean Pediatrics in Orange County, California.",

      "Though federal recommendations are not mandates \u2014 states have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren \u2014 they can affect how easy it is for kids to get shots if doctors choose to follow them.",
      "Under the new guidelines, O'Shea said, parents seeking shots in the shared decision-making category might no longer bring their kids in for a quick, vaccine-only appointment with staff. They'd sit down with a health care provider and discuss the vaccine. And it could be tougher to have a flu clinic, where parents drive up and kids get shots without seeing a doctor.",
      "Still, doctors say they won\u2019t let the changes stop them from helping children get the vaccines they need. Leading medical groups are sticking with prior vaccine recommendations. Many parents are, too.",
      "Megan Landry, whose 4-year-old son Zackary is one of O\u2019Shea\u2019s patients, is among them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my responsibility as a parent to protect my child\u2019s health and well-being,\u201d she said. \u201cVaccines are a really effective and well-studied way to do that.\u201d",
      "She plans to keep having the same conversations she\u2019s always had with O\u2019Shea before getting vaccines for Zackary.",
      "\u201cRelying on evidence and trusted medical guidance really helps me to make those decisions,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd for me, it\u2019s not just a personal choice for my own son but a way to contribute to the health of everybody.\u201d",

      "The justices, who will hear arguments in the spring, will review an appellate ruling that would allow the lawsuit against Cisco to go forward in U.S. courts.",

Cisco argues it isn\u2019t liable under those laws, the 18th-century Alien Tort Statute (ATS) or the Torture Victim Protection Act (TVPA), first enacted in 1991.",
      "In recent years, the Supreme Court and presidential administrations of both parties have been skeptical of lawsuits seeking to use U.S. courts as a venue to seek justice over the acts of foreign governments, especially those that took place abroad. To try to overcome that skepticism, Falun Gong members have argued that a substantial portion of Cisco\u2019s activities involving China took place in the United States.",

      "The data center, called MACROHARDRR, is being built in Mississippi\u2019s DeSoto County near Memphis, Tennessee. It will be the company\u2019s third data center in the greater Memphis area. xAI CFO Anthony Armstrong said the cluster of data centers will house \u201cthe world's largest supercomputer\" with 2 gigawatts of computing power.",

      "DeepSeek, a Chinese tech startup, is gaining traction in developing nations, narrowing the AI adoption gap with advanced economies",
      "HONG KONG -- DeepSeek, the Chinese tech startup that rivals OpenAI's ChatGPT, has been gaining ground in many developing nations in a trend that could narrow the gap of artificial intelligence adoption with advanced economies, a new report suggested.",
      "In the Thursday report, researchers from Microsoft said global adoption of generative AI tools reached 16.3% of the world\u2019s population in the three months to December, up from 15.1% in the previous three months.",
      "Yet the divide of AI adoption in developed and developing countries is widening, the report noted, with AI adoption across advanced economies growing nearly twice as fast as developing nations.",
      "\u201cWe are seeing a divide and we are concerned that that divide will continue to widen,\u201d said Juan Lavista Ferres, chief data scientist for Microsoft's AI for Good Lab, which used anonymized \u201ctelemetry\u201d to help track global device usage.",
      "Countries that invested early and consistently in digital infrastructure and AI led in terms of shares of users, including the United Arab Emirates, Singapore, France and Spain, according to the report. Some of Microsoft's figures overlapped with the findings of a Pew Research Center survey published in October that mapped which countries are more excited than concerned about AI. In both reports, for instance, South Korea stood out in its embrace of AI.",
      "Microsoft has a vested interest in AI adoption \u2014 its business and much of the tech industry and stock market is staking its future on AI tools becoming more widely used and profitable \u2014 but Lavista Ferres said his lab is looking more broadly at the topic.",
      "His researchers found that the rise of Chinese startup DeepSeek, which was founded in 2023, has fueled wider AI adoption across the developing world given its free and \u201copen source\u201d models \u2013 with key components available for anyone to access and modify.",
      "When DeepSeek released its advanced reasoning AI model called R1 in January 2025, which it said was more cost-effective than OpenAI\u2019s similar model, it raised eyebrows in the global technology industry and many were surprised by how China is catching up with the U.S. in technological advancements. Leading science journal Nature published peer-reviewed research co-authored by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng in September, describing it as a \u201clandmark paper\u201d from the Chinese startup.",
      "Lavista Ferres said DeepSeek is a \u201cgood model\u201d for tasks like math or coding, but it operates differently from U.S.-based models on topics like politics.",
      "\u201cWe have observed that for certain type of questions, of course, they follow the same type of access to the internet that China has,\u201d he said. \u201cWhich means that there will be questions that will be answered very differently, particularly political questions. In many ways that can have an influence on the world.\u201d",
      "DeepSeek offers a free\u2011to\u2011use chatbot on web and mobile, and has also given developers global access to modify and build on its core engine. Its lack of subscription fees has \"lowered the barrier for millions of users, especially in price\u2011sensitive regions,\u201d Microsoft's report said.",

      "Developed countries including Australia, Germany and the U.S. have sought to limit the use of DeepSeek over alleged security risks. Microsoft last year banned its own employees from using DeepSeek. Adoption of DeepSeek remained low in North America and Europe, the report found, but it surged in its home country China, as well as Russia, Iran, Cuba, Belarus \u2013 places where U.S. services face restrictions or where foreign tech access is limited.",
      "In many places, DeepSeek\u2019s prevalence correlated with it being a default chatbot on widely available phones made by Chinese tech companies like Huawei.",
      "DeepSeek\u2019s market share in China was 89%, the report estimated. That\u2019s followed by Belarus\u2019s 56% and Cuba\u2019s 49%, both of which also had low AI adoption more broadly. In Russia, its market share was around 43%.",
      "In Syria and Iran, DeepSeek\u2019s market share reached around 23% and 25%, respectively, the report added. In many African countries including Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Niger, DeepSeek\u2019s market share was between 11% to 14%.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday indicated a jury will be allowed to decide whether artificial intelligence trailblazer OpenAI hoodwinked its billionaire co-founder Elon Musk during its evolution from a nonprofit research lab into a capitalistic enterprise...",
      "A federal judge on Wednesday indicated a jury will be allowed to decide whether artificial intelligence trailblazer OpenAI hoodwinked its billionaire co-founder Elon Musk during its evolution from a nonprofit research lab into a capitalistic enterprise now valued at $500 billion.",
      "Without issuing an official ruling, U.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers made it clear that she intended to reject OpenAI's motion to dismiss a 17-month-old case that Musk filed against a San Francisco startup that he helped create in 2015.",
      "\u201cThis case is going to trial,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said emphatically during an occasionally testy 90-minute hearing held in Oakland, California.",
      "The judge said she still needed to figure out some of the logistics of how the trial will be set up, as well as whether to dismiss unjust enrichment allegations that Musk has made against Microsoft, which has accumulated a $135 billion stake in OpenAI since investing $1 billion in a for-profit subsidiary that the startup created in 2019.",
      "But the judge told lawyers that there is sufficient evidence for a jury to consider in a legal showdown pitting Musk \u2014 the world's richest man with an estimated fortune of $713 billion \u2014 against OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, whose fortune is currently pegged at $2 billion. Both billionaires would likely be summoned to court to testify under oath if the trial proceeds.",
      "\u201cPart of this is about whether a jury believes the people who will testify and whether they are credible,\u201d Gonzalez Rogers said.",
      "It's unclear when the judge will schedule the trial.",
      "The case revolves around OpenAI's origins as a nonprofit research lab that Musk and Altman launched to develop artificial intelligence designed primarily for the good of humanity. That mission, the two founders believed, could serve as a foil to AI being developed by Google and other profit-driven companies that, they claimed, could deploy the technology recklessly as they strived to make more money.",
      "Musk contributed $40 million, mostly funneled through donor-advised funds that he had set up, in addition to four Tesla vehicles. Then he and Altman had a falling out over OpenAI's future, according to evidence that has surfaced so far.",

      "At that point, Musk began to suspect that Altman and another OpenAI executive, Greg Brockman, might be plotting to transform the research lab into a profit-seeking company, according to evidence submitted to the the judge.",
      "Although Altman sought to reassure Musk he remained committed to OpenAI's non-profit mission, Musk decided to cut ties with the startup and eventually launched a rival, xAI, that was valued at $230 billion in a just-completed fundraising.",
      "A 2017 diary entry by OpenAI's Brockman was among the information that Gonzalez Rogers cited to support her rationale for allowing Musk's lawsuit to go to trial.",
      "In the diary, Brockman mused about his desire to become a billionaire and wrote, \u201cWe\u2019ve been thinking that maybe we should just flip to a for profit. Making the money for us sounds great and all,\u201d according to court filings.",
      "At one point, OpenAI's own board of directors had serious enough misgivings about Altman's motives to trigger his firing in 2023 before quickly bringing him back as CEO in a comeback that Microsoft helped orchestrate.",
      "One of the key issues that must be decided before Musk can pursue his fraud claims against OpenAI at trial is pinpointing when the alleged deceit occurred. That's because there's a three-year statute of limitations on his fraud claims.",
      "Gonzalez Rogers indicated she will probably let a jury first decide when the alleged fraud against Musk occurred. The trial then would be allowed to proceed to the fraud phase if it's determined that the suspected deceit began less than three years before Musk's August 2024 filing of his lawsuit.",

      "He said it is too early to tell if Mayon\u2019s restiveness would worsen and lead to a major and violent eruption given the absence of other key signs of unrest, like a spike in volcanic earthquakes and high levels of sulfur dioxide emissions.",
      "Troops, police and disaster-mitigation personnel helped evacuate more than 2,800 villagers from 729 households inside a 6-kilometer (3.7-mile) radius from the volcano\u2019s crater that officials have long designated a permanent danger zone, demarcated by concrete warning signs, Albay provincial officials said.",

      "The problem is amplified both because Musk pitches his chatbot as an edgier alternative to rivals with more safeguards, and because Grok's images are publicly visible, and can therefore be easily spread.",
      "Nonprofit group AI Forensics said in a report that it analyzed 20,000 images generated by Grok between Dec. 25 and Jan. 1 and found that 2% depicted a person who appeared to be 18 or younger, including 30 of young or very young women or girls, in bikinis or transparent clothes.",
      "Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, responded to a request for comment with the automated response, \u201cLegacy Media Lies\u201d.",
      "However, X did not deny that the troublesome content generated through Grok exists. Yet it still claimed in a post on its Safety account, that it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, \u201cby removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary.\"",
      "The platform also repeated a comment from Musk, who said, \u201cAnyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.\u201d",
      "A growing list of countries are demanding that Musk does more to rein in explicit or abusive content.",
      "X must \u201curgently\u201d deal with the problem, Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said Tuesday, adding that she supported additional scrutiny from the U.K.\u2019s communications regulator, Ofcom.",
      "Kendall said the content is \u201cabsolutely appalling, and unacceptable in decent society.\"",
      "\u201cWe cannot and will not allow the proliferation of these demeaning and degrading images, which are disproportionately aimed at women and girls.\"",
      "Ofcom said Monday it has made \u201curgent contact\u201d with X.",
      "\u201cWe are aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children,\u201d the watchdog said.",
      "The watchdog said it contacted both X and xAI to understand what steps it has taken to comply with British regulations.",
      "Under the U.K.\u2019s Online Safety Act, social media platforms must prevent and remove child sexual abuse material when they become aware of it.",
      "A Polish lawmaker used Grok on Tuesday as a reason for national digital safety legislation that would beef up protections for minors and make it easier for authorities to remove content.",

      "A golden phone that President Donald Trump's family business promised to release last year remains mysteriously under wraps as the technology industry serves up a glut of new gadgets at CES in Las Vegas this week.",
      "When the Trump Organization launched a mobile phone service last June, it was supposed to be a stage setter for a new smartphone bathed in gold with a $500 price tag \u2014 a bargain compared to Apple's latest iPhone models that sell for anywhere from $800 to $1,200. The newly formed Trump Mobile targeted its T1 phone for an August or September release.",

      "But both the T1's shipping date and U.S. manufacturing ambitions gradually began to shift, even as Trump Mobile continues to accept $100 deposits for the device.",
      "Not long after announcing the device, Trump Mobile pivoted from describing it as phone that would be made in the U.S. to framing it as a device that would be \u201cproudly American.\u201d Trump Mobile's website now touts the T1 as having an \u201cAmerican-proud\u201d design, with no further explanation.",
      "Analysts believed that the shift stemmed from a recognition that the U.S. lacked the supply chain and other logistics required to make a smartphone for less than $1,000 \u2014 the same hurdles that made it implausible for Apple to acquiesce to President Trump's demands that the company move its iPhone manufacturing from China and India.",
      "Later in the summer, Trump Mobile also became more vague about when the T1 would become available, but still indicated it would be delivered to customers who paid the $100 deposit by the end of 2025. Trump Mobile's website continues to list the T1's targeted release date as \u201clater this year.\u201d",

The Financial Times recently reported that it was told by a customer service representative for Trump Mobile that the phone will be shipped in late January and attributed its delayed release to the 43-day shutdown of the federal government last year.",

      "While the T1 has remained in a holding pattern, Trump Mobile has been selling its wireless service for $47.45 per month \u2014 a price tied to Donald Trump's titles as the 47th and 45th President. For customers looking for a smartphone that they can use sooner rather than later, Trump Mobile is also selling refurbished versions of older iPhones and Samsung's Galaxy models at prices ranging from $370 to $630.",
      "\u201cMaybe they changed their strategy and figured out they are better off just selling refurbished phones,\u201d Jeronimo said.",

      "Trump has repeatedly denounced Powell for alleged overspending tied to the central bank's $2.5 billion renovation project. The Fed attributes spending overruns to unforeseen cost increases, saying that its building renovation will ultimately \"reduce costs over time by allowing the Board to consolidate most of its operations,\" according to the central bank's website.",
      "Federal law allows the president to remove the Fed chair for \"cause\" -- though no president has ever done so. Powell's term as chair is set to expire in May, but he can remain on the Fed's policymaking board until 2028. Powell has not indicated whether he intends to remain on the board.",
      "In a video message on Sunday, Powell said the allegations against him amount to \"pretexts\" invoked in service of the Trump administration's push for lower interest rates.",
      "\"No one -- certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve -- is above the law,\" Powell said. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",

      "The lava flows are especially spectacular after sunset, but under the new rules, excursions are allowed only until dusk and can go no closer than 200 meters (660 feet) to the lava flow.

      "Muhammad Ali is being honored with a commemorative U.S. postage stamp",
      "Muhammad Ali once joked that he should be a postage stamp because \u201cthat\u2019s the only way I\u2019ll ever get licked.\u201d",
      "Now, the three-time heavyweight champion's quip is becoming reality.",
      "Widely regarded as the most famous and influential boxer of all time, and a cultural force who fused athletic brilliance with political conviction and showmanship, Ali is being honored for the first time with a commemorative U.S. postage stamp.",
      "\u201cAs sort of the guardian of his legacy, I\u2019m thrilled. I\u2019m excited. I\u2019m ecstatic,\u201d Lonnie Ali, the champ's wife of nearly 30 years, told The Associated Press. \u201cBecause people, every time they look at that stamp, they will remember him. And he will be in the forefront of their consciousness. And, for me, that's a thrill.\u201d",
      "Muhammad Ali died in 2016 at the age of 74 after living with Parkinson's disease for more than three decades. During his lifetime and posthumously, the man known as The Greatest has received numerous awards, including an Olympic gold medal in 1960, the United Nations Messenger of Peace award in 1998 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005.",
      "Having his face on a stamp, Lonnie Ali said, has a particular significance because it's a chance to highlight his mission of spreading compassion and his ability to connect with people.",
      "\u201cHe did it one person at a time,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that's such a lovely way to connect with people, to send them a letter and to use this stamp to reinforce the messaging in that life of connection.\u201d",
      "A first-day-of-issue ceremony for the Muhammad Ali Forever Stamp is planned for Thursday in Louisville, Kentucky, the birthplace of the famed boxer and home to the Muhammad Ali Center, which showcases his life and legacy. That's when people can buy Muhammad Ali Forever Stamps featuring a black-and-white Associated Press photo from 1974 of Ali in his famous boxing pose.",
      "Each sheet of 20 stamps also features a photo of Ali posing in a pinstripe suit, a recognition of his work as an activist and humanitarian. Twenty-two million stamps have been printed. Once they sell out, they won't be reprinted, U.S. Postal Service officials said. The stamps are expected to generate a lot of interest from collectors and noncollectors.",
      "Because they're Forever Stamps, the First-Class Mail postage will always remain valid, which Lonnie Ali calls an \u201cultimate\u201d tribute.",
      "\u201cThis is going to be a Forever Stamp from the post office,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's just one of those things that will be part of his legacy, and it will be one of the shining stars of his legacy, getting this stamp.\u201d",
      "Lisa Bobb-Semple, the USPS director of stamp services, said the idea for a Muhammad Ali stamp first came about shortly after his death almost a decade ago. But the process of developing a stamp is a long one. The USPS requires people who appear on stamps to be dead for at least three years, with the exception of presidents.",
      "As the USPS was working behind the scenes on a stamp, a friend of Ali helped to launch the #GetTheChampAStamp campaign, which sparked public interest in the idea.",

      "Members of the Citizen Stamps Advisory Committee, appointed by the postmaster general, are responsible for selecting who and what appears on stamps. Each quarter, they meet with Bobb-Semple and her team to review suggestions submitted by the public. There are usually about 20 to 25 commemorative stamp issues each year.",
      "Once a stamp idea is selected, Bobb-Semple and her team work with one of several art directors to design the postage. It then goes through a lengthy final approval process, including a rigorous review by the USPS legal staff, before it can be issued to the public.",
      "Antonio Alcal\u00e1, art director and designer of the Muhammad Ali stamp, said hundreds of images were reviewed before the final choices were narrowed to a few. Finally, the AP image, taken by an unnamed photographer, was chosen. It shows Ali in his prime, posing with boxing gloves and looking straight into the camera.",
      "Alcal\u00e1 said there's a story behind every USPS stamp.",
      "\u201cPostage stamps are miniature works of art designed to reflect the American experience, highlight heroes, history, milestones, achievements and natural wonders of America,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Muhammad Ali stamps are a great example of that.\u201d",
      "Beyond the boxing ring, Ali was outspoken about his beliefs when many Black Americans were still fighting to be heard. Born Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name after converting to Islam in the 1960s and spoke openly about race, religion and war. In 1967, he refused to be inducted into the U.S. Army, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War.",
      "That stance cost Ali his heavyweight championship title and barred him from boxing for more than three years. Convicted of draft evasion, he was sentenced to five years in prison but remained free while appealing the case. The conviction was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971, further cementing his prominence as a worldwide figure.",
      "Later in life, Ali emerged as a global humanitarian and used his fame to promote peace, religious understanding and charitable causes, even as Parkinson\u2019s disease limited his speech and movement.",
      "The commemorative postage stamp comes at a time of political division in the U.S. and the world. Lonnie Ali said if her husband were alive today, he'd probably \u201cblock a lot of this out\u201d and continue to be a compassionate person who connects with people every day.",
      "That approach, she said, is especially important now.",
      "\u201cWe have to mobilize Muhammad\u2019s life and sort of engage in the same kinds of acts of kindness and compassion that he did every day,\u201d she said.",

      "For thousands of Venezuelans living in the U.S., the days since the Trump administration ousted Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro have brought a mixture of joy and trepidation",
      "NEW YORK -- In the days since the Trump administration ousted Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a late-night military raid, Alejandra Salima has spoken to fellow Venezuelan migrants in her role as an advocate. Like her, most voice feelings that seesaw between joy and trepidation, she said.",
      "The removal of Maduro is \u201ca first step, but we\u2019re nervous,\u201d said Salima, who fled to the U.S. three years ago with her 7-year-old son and assists other Venezuelans at the Miami office of the National TPS Alliance. With the regime that Maduro led still in place, \u201cat this moment, returning would put me and my son at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "For more than 770,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S., reactions to Trump's forceful moves in the country they left behind \u2014 and the one that has taken them in \u2014 are as intense as they are complicated.",
      "Many are thrilled by the removal of Maduro, who harassed and jailed political opponents while presiding over an economic collapse, driving millions of Venezuelans from the country. But as they try to figure out what\u2019s next for them and for families and friends still in Venezuela, many share Salima\u2019s conflicted feelings.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s move to deport Venezuelans without permanent residency has increased worry. Many were allowed to stay in the U.S. after they were granted Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, a designation Trump revoked after taking office. At the same time, the fear instilled by the government Maduro left behind makes many wary of returning.",
      "\u201cFirst, they grabbed Maduro, and I feel happy, happy, happy, grateful to the Trump administration,\u201d said Manuel Coronel, a lawyer who left Venezuela in 2017 and now lives just north of Salt Lake City. But he worries the change will be too limited.",
      "\u201cThey got him, but the criminals are still there,\u201d said Coronel, who is 54 and works at an immigration law practice. \u201cThere\u2019s no new government. Everything\u2019s exactly the same.\u201d",
      "The tensions belie assurances by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who asserted that \u201coverwhelmingly the Venezuelans that I\u2019ve heard from or talked to are excited about the changes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey have more opportunities to go back to their country and have it be more successful and provide for their families today than they did a week ago when Maduro was still in charge,\u201d Noem said last week.",
      "But in interviews with Venezuelans who live in communities around the U.S. there was little indication of a rush to return.",
      "\u201cThank God we\u2019re here,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Rojas, who ended up in New York City after fleeing the Venezuela capital of Caracas in 2018.",
      "Rojas, 31, recounted how Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation, which topped 1 million percent the year he fled, made it impossible to buy essentials like diapers after his partner became pregnant. They went first to Ecuador then Peru, but left to escape crime, joining thousands of Venezuelans who migrated on foot through the jungle of Panama\u2019s Dari\u00e9n Gap.",
      "Since the couple and their son arrived in the U.S., Rojas has obtained political asylum, a work permit and a driver\u2019s license.",
      "In an interview this week at a Venezuelan restaurant on a New York City street lined with immigrant-run businesses, Rojas welcomed the toppling of Maduro \u201cso there can be change in Venezuela, because many people are struggling.\u201d",
      "But he expressed doubt about the Trump administration\u2019s tightened policies on Venezuelans in the U.S. that have already pushed a number of his friends to leave for countries in South America and elsewhere.",
      "For Venezuelans in the U.S., Trump has \u201cdone good things and he\u2019s done bad things,\" said Rojas as he and his wife tucked into the restaurant's $30 special: a heaping platter of fried potatoes, cassava, corn cakes, sausages, beef, chicken, plantains, fried pork rinds and cheese.",

      "\u201cIt all depends on your point of view.\u201d",
      "About 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country over the past decade, with the great majority landing elsewhere in Latin America. Hundreds of thousands have made their way to the U.S., with large numbers settling in suburban communities like Kissimmee, Florida, outside Orlando, and Herriman, Utah, outside Salt Lake City.",
      "Venezuelans quickly became among the largest nationalities to immigrate to the U.S. after COVID-19, lured in part by job prospects. The Biden administration offered new or expanded temporary legal protections, largely ended by Trump after he took office. Hundreds of thousands more were released in the United States after entering illegally from Mexico to pursue asylum or other forms of relief in immigration court.",
      "For people like Jesus Martinez, who fled to the U.S. in 2021 after facing physical threats and persecution, \u201clife in Venezuela is behind us.\u201d",
      "Martinez, who now lives with his wife and children in Orem, Utah, and has applied for political asylum, recalled how life in Venezuela had become intolerable. While it is a relief that Maduro has been removed, he said, the Trump administration's push to send Venezuelans back to a country whose government they still deeply distrust presents a paradox.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a contradictory situation,\" said Martinez, 50. He noted that it will take considerable time before loyalists to Maduro are rooted out and Venezuela can make a transition to a stable democracy.",
      "Salima, 48, who works in the Miami advocacy office, was active in opposition politics in Venezuela, where she trained as a lawyer and marched in peaceful protests. She came to the U.S. legally with her son, who is now 10 years old, on a temporary permit for humanitarian reasons, which Trump has revoked. She is elated by Maduro\u2019s ouster.",
      "But those feelings are tempered by her unease over Venezuela\u2019s future while his allies are still in power. Her mother remains in Venezuela and, even with Maduro gone, she refuses to discuss politics during chats on an encrypted app, fearful that government authorities who remain in power will find out, Salima said.",
      "With that reality still in place, the pending end of Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelans makes her feel \u201cvery unstable,\u201d Salima said.",
      "Rallying with other Venezuelans this week in Doral, Florida, to celebrate Maduro's ouster, Jorge Galicia recounted fleeing in 2018 after a fellow student activist was arrested during a wave of demonstrations against the regime.",
      "After settling in the Miami area, Galicia said he joined Charlie Kirk\u2019s conservative Turning Point USA movement, whose politics closely align with Trump\u2019s. But Galicia, 30, said his support for the Trump administration began to waver as the White House\u2019s crackdown on immigrants intensified, breaking up families.",
      "Now, with Maduro gone, he expects many of the Venezuelans who fled to neighboring countries and the U.S. to start returning home. But he hopes Trump will reconsider his decision to deport Venezuelans like himself who have built new lives in the U.S. but still lack permanent status.",
      "\u201cThe reason we\u2019re here is because there was a horrible regime that forced millions of us to leave,\u201d said Galicia, wrapped in a Venezuelan flag. But, he said, \u201ceveryone deserves to have the choice of returning home.\u201d",
      "\u2014-",

      "A new analysis of railroad accident data reveals a recurring cycle of industry opposition and federal inaction to attempts to improve safety",
      "Human errors and track defects caused more than 3,000 rail accidents over the last decade, killing 23 people and injuring nearly 1,200. Yet federal railroad regulators failed to implement most of the safety recommendations that emerged from accident investigations.",
      "That\u2019s according to an original analysis by the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland.",
      "Behind those numbers, the Howard Center found, is a powerful industry that uses its money and influence to stymie federal safety reforms. It\u2019s actively lobbying President Donald Trump\u2019s administration to further reduce track inspection and repair requirements and loosen rules aimed at preventing crew fatigue.",
      "The center\u2019s analysis of data from the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates major accidents and recommends safety improvements, found it gave federal railroad regulators 81 recommendations from 2015 through 2024. The Federal Railroad Administration has only fully implemented five of them \u2014 the lowest rate of any regulatory agency in the Department of Transportation.",
      "Three of the lingering safety recommendations came out of a 2021 derailment of Amtrak\u2019s Empire Builder passenger train in Joplin, Montana.",
      "Zach Schneider, 28, was watching Montana\u2019s Great Plains roll by from the observation car of the long-distance train. Margie and Don Varnadoe, on a trip to celebrate their 50th anniversary, were walking between cars. All three were thrown to their deaths just before 4 p.m. on Sept. 25, when the train derailed, injuring 49 people.",
      "An investigation by the safety board blamed the tragedy in part on worn-down rail and other defects in the tracks owned by BNSF Railway \u2014 defects the company inspector likely missed due to his workload, according to the NTSB.",
      "But board officials went further, citing the FRA\u2019s failure to set rules for track replacement or workloads. The safety agency had already recommended both measures repeatedly after previous rail accidents.",
      "FRA spokesperson Warren Flatau said in late September that the agency currently has 102 open safety board recommendations, some dating back as far as 1998, and \u201cis currently taking action or planning to take action\u201d on more than 70% of them.",
      "He said the agency plans no immediate action on the rest, generally because officials have determined they are infeasible or can be addressed with existing regulations.",
      "The FRA didn\u2019t respond to requests for additional information on what actions it is taking.",
      "To understand why rail safety initiatives have fared so poorly, the Howard Center examined the fate of safety reforms recommended repeatedly by investigators following major accidents over years, even decades.",
      "The analysis revealed a recurring cycle of industry opposition, FRA inaction, congressional capitulation and tragedy.",
      "The three major American freight railroads included in this story \u2014 BNSF, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific \u2014 did not dispute any of the facts or findings. All sent statements saying they are committed to safety.",
      "In 1980, a train carrying vinyl chloride \u2014 the same cancer-causing chemical at the center of the 2023 East Palestine, Ohio, train disaster \u2014 derailed in Muldraugh, Kentucky, causing two carloads of the flammable gas to spill and catch fire, and a third to vent toxic fumes. Four crew members were injured and about 6,500 people were evacuated.",
      "Investigators concluded the accident was caused in part by dangerously worn-down rail, one of several types of track defects that, collectively, contribute to about a quarter of the rail accidents in the United States.",
      "The safety board called on regulators to set a limit on how much wear a rail can sustain before it has to be replaced. But the FRA never addressed the issue. An FRA-sponsored study in 1998 found such limits would improve safety, but still it took no action.",
      "In the 45 years since the Muldraugh derailment, 44 people have died and another 2,300 have been injured in nearly 15,000 main-line accidents blamed on track defects, according to the Howard Center\u2019s analysis of FRA accident data.",
      "The fatal Montana derailment occurred on one of the busiest long-distance tourist routes in the U.S., carrying more than 300,000 passengers each year between Chicago and the Pacific Northwest.",
      "NTSB officials found the rail wear limits they recommended in the 1980s would have required BNSF to replace the rail involved in the accident.",
      "A BNSF inspector had driven over the track in a company vehicle twice the week of the derailment and documented concerns about that section of track. But the inspector didn\u2019t get out to walk the tracks, something the NTSB said likely would have identified defects. There had been no reported walking inspection in nearly a year.",
      "In a statement, BNSF said it inspects its tracks in excess of federal requirements.",
      "\u201cThis tragedy is a powerful reminder that there\u2019s no substitute for robust track inspection practices,\u201d NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy said in a statement after the investigation, imploring track owners to provide inspectors the time and resources to do their work effectively.",
      "The safety board recommended again in July 2023 that the FRA regulate rail wear. A month later, the agency said it was \u201ccommitted to working with NTSB to prevent future accidents and save lives\u201d and that it \u201cwelcomes and will consider all recommendations that will further that goal.\u201d The NTSB website showed no further response as of Dec. 18 from the FRA.",
      "Meanwhile, the industry\u2019s largest trade group is pushing to reduce human inspection requirements. In May, the Association of American Railroads, the trade group that represents the largest and wealthiest North American railroads, suggested reducing the frequency of required human track inspections in favor of additional automated inspections \u2014 a move it argued would \u201cimprove safety and reduce regulatory costs.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 5, federal regulators granted AAR\u2019s request to let railroads do just that. The FRA approved a waiver that will allow participating railroads to cut weekly visual inspections in half, provided they comply with a number of new safety and reporting requirements.",
      "The NTSB says automated inspections are a supplement to human inspections, not a replacement for them, in part because neither method is 100% effective.",
      "BNSF said use of automation allows the company to detect and repair defects more quickly.",
      "Lance Marston, a rail inspector for Norfolk Southern, said the technology excels at identifying certain track defects not always visible to the human eye, such as the rails being too far apart. But it isn\u2019t designed to detect over two-thirds of rail issues human inspectors are trained to look for, including broken rails, according to data from the AAR and rail workers\u2019 unions.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s just no replacement for getting out there and putting boots on the ground,\u201d Marston said.",
      "Norfolk Southern said in a statement that automated inspection is just one part of its process and human inspectors play a \u201ccritical role\u201d in evaluating the technology\u2019s assessments.",

      "\u201cWe used to ride, like, 70 miles \u2026 and we used to have three track inspectors,\u201d said Lee, whose territory now covers over 90 miles of track running from southern Wyoming and into Nebraska. \u201cNow it\u2019s solely on two guys, two people, to ride the whole thing.\u201d",
      "An inspector in a BNSF maintenance vehicle rode over the accident site in Joplin two days before the derailment and noted some track anomalies. But he didn\u2019t stop to look closer and missed critical defects that led to the derailment, the NTSB found.",
      "Safety board investigators surmised he probably didn\u2019t have the time. That day, he had worked 16 hours inspecting 127 miles of track \u2014 \u201can excessive amount,\u201d the NTSB said. Investigators faulted BNSF\u2019s safety culture, finding the railroad hadn\u2019t done enough to manage employee workloads.",
      "Fatigued workers, the NTSB reminded the company, make mistakes. It was a message the board had repeated since at least 2004.",
      "In the pre-dawn hours of June 28, 2004, a Union Pacific engineer was operating on less than two hours\u2019 sleep when he blew through a signal light and hit a BNSF train in Macdona, Texas. Over 9,000 gallons of liquid chlorine escaped from a punctured tank car, engulfing the area in a cloud of chlorine gas that suffocated the conductor and two local residents, and left 30 people in severe respiratory distress.",
      "The engineer went to bed late the previous night after visiting his daughter and playing cards with a friend. His first shift that weekend had ended Saturday afternoon, but only 9\u00bd hours later, he\u2019d reported for a 12-hour overnight shift, which ended just before noon Sunday. At 2:45 a.m. Monday, he was called in to operate the locomotive that would crash less than three hours later.",
      "The NTSB\u2019s investigation found the engineer\u2019s fatigue \u2014 triggered by a chronic lack of sleep, disrupted sleep cycle and long work shifts \u2014 led to the fatal mistake that caused the collision.",
      "Like many freight train employees, the Union Pacific crew worked on-call, not on set schedules. Regulators give railroads broad discretion over crew scheduling, and employees are expected to adapt.",
      "In a statement, the AAR said the \u201cdynamic\u201d nature of railroad operations \u201cpresents unique scheduling challenges.\u201d The industry, it said, \u201ccontinues to invest in tools, technology, and collaboration to support employee well-being and operational safety.\u201d",
      "But in its request to the Trump administration to roll back regulations, the AAR argued regulatory mandates aimed at preventing fatigue-related accidents are overly burdensome. The mandates, it said, create opportunities for employees to abuse fatigue-related protections.",
      "The AAR declined repeated requests to provide examples of abuse or potential abuse of fatigue-related protections by employees.",
      "\u201cIf I go back through my career as an engineer and I think about mistakes that I made, I can almost attribute all of them to fatigue,\u201d said Scott Bunten, a general chairman for the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, one of the two major rail unions.",
      "In 2006, the safety board recommended the FRA better regulate crew scheduling practices. But the agency didn\u2019t take action.",
      "Less than two years later, as part of the Rail Safety Improvement Act, Congress mandated implementation of fatigue risk management plans in the freight rail industry. It also said railroads were responsible for screening employees for sleep disorders and providing fatigue training.",

      "\u201cThank you for being here this morning. Gathering is such a critical, critical thing to do, especially in these times. It\u2019s been a difficult week,\" the Rev. Hierald Osorto, pastor at St. Paul's-San Pablo Lutheran Church, told a crowd seated on wooden benches.",
      "The service comes as Minneapolis has the spotlight as the latest flashpoint in President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. The Department of Homeland Security has sent roughly 2,000 agents and officers to the region in a show of force, sparking fear in the city's immigrant communities and strong opposition among activists who are pushing back loudly against enforcement.",
      "The church, which actively ministers to a largely immigrant congregation, is located in a neighborhood that has seen heavy immigration enforcement activities since Homeland Security targeted the city. It's also just 1 1/2 miles (2.4 kilometers) from the block where Renee Good was shot Wednesday by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, sending tensions even higher.",
      "In many ways it was a typical Sunday service. Candles were lit, hymns sung, and communion offered.",
      "But outside, immigration enforcement officers were actively driving through in the neighborhood, detaining people while activists blasted away on whistles and beat drums, hoping to stop them.",
      "Church security stood guard by the doors and controlled who came in.",
      "Inside St. Paul\u2019s, worshippers lit candles and greeted each other with smiles and hugs. A statute of Our Lady of Guadalupe stood at the front of the church.",
      "Church volunteers handed out pamphlets that included information on the service, the songs to be sung and the prayers that would be offered. On the front was a drawing of a woman holding a sack with the words, \u201cJustice is for Everyone: Immigrant Rights Now!\u201d",
      "The church has long been part of the community. Osorto says it began with a predominantly Swedish congregation with services held in Swedish. As times changed, the services shifted to Swedish and English, then just English. Nowadays, it's a mixture of Spanish and English with Osorto seamlessly switching between the two languages.",
      "During the service Sunday, Osorto said a prayer for Good. He said he noticed a slight dip in attendance Sunday but still, he was pleased with the turnout given all the congregation is going through.",
      "\u201cI think that it\u2019s important for folks to realize that what\u2019s happened here in the Twin Cities has changed us for the rest of our lives,\u201d he said after the service.",

But Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \u201censure alignment with the president\u2019s directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\u201d",
      "Trump's original \u201cportrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \u201cImpeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\u201d",
      "Then the text continues: \u201cAfter losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\u201d",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Trump's \u201cunmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\u201d",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries such as what had been part of Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",
      "Ingle did not answer questions about whether Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.",
      "The gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.",
      "\u201cThe museum is beginning its planned update of the America\u2019s Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\u201d the gallery statement said. \u201cFor some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist\u2019s name.\u201d",

      "The Cuban government said 32 of its military personnel were killed during the American operation last weekend that captured Maduro. The personnel from Cuba\u2019s two main security agencies were in Caracas, the Venezuelan capital, as part of an agreement between Cuba and Venezuela.",
      "\u201cVenezuela doesn\u2019t need protection anymore from the thugs and extortionists who held them hostage for so many years,\u201d Trump said Sunday. \u201cVenezuela now has the United States of America, the most powerful military in the World (by far!), to protect them, and protect them we will.\u201d",
      "Trump also responded to another account\u2019s social media post predicting that his secretary of state, Marco Rubio, will be president of Cuba: \u201cSounds good to me!\u201d Trump said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Becky Pepper-Jackson finished third in the discus throw in West Virginia last year though she was in just her first year of high school. Now a 15-year-old sophomore, Pepper-Jackson is aware that her upcoming season could be her last.",
      "West Virginia has banned transgender girls like Pepper-Jackson from competing in girls and women's sports, and is among the more than two dozen states with similar laws. Though the West Virginia law has been blocked by lower courts, the outcome could be different at the conservative-dominated Supreme Court, which has allowed multiple restrictions on transgender people to be enforced in the past year.",
      "The justices are hearing arguments Tuesday in two cases over whether the sports bans violate the Constitution or the landmark federal law known as Title IX that prohibits sex discrimination in education. The second case comes from Idaho, where college student Lindsay Hecox challenged that state's law.",

      "Pepper-Jackson has grown into a competitive discus and shot put thrower. In addition to the bronze medal in the discus, she finished eighth among shot putters.",
      "She attributes her success to hard work, practicing at school and in her backyard, and lifting weights. Pepper-Jackson has been taking puberty-blocking medication and has publicly identified as a girl since she was in the third grade, though the Supreme Court's decision in June upholding state bans on gender-affirming medical treatment for minors has forced her to go out of state for care.",
      "Her very improvement as an athlete has been cited as a reason she should not be allowed to compete against girls.",
      "\u201cThere are immutable physical and biological characteristic differences between men and women that make men bigger, stronger, and faster than women. And if we allow biological males to play sports against biological females, those differences will erode the ability and the places for women in these sports which we have fought so hard for over the last 50 years,\u201d West Virginia's attorney general, JB McCuskey, said in an AP interview. McCuskey said he is not aware of any other transgender athlete in the state who has competed or is trying to compete in girls or women\u2019s sports.",
      "Despite the small numbers of transgender athletes, the issue has taken on outsize importance. The NCAA and the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committees banned transgender women from women's sports after Trump signed an executive order aimed at barring their participation.",
      "The public generally is supportive of the limits.

      "Greenland\u2019s harsh environment, lack of key infrastructure and difficult geology have prevented anyone from building a mine to extract the sought-after rare earth elements that many high-tech products require",
      "Greenland's harsh environment, lack of key infrastructure and difficult geology have so far prevented anyone from building a mine to extract the sought-after rare earth elements that many high-tech products require. Even if President Donald Trump prevails in his effort to take control of the arctic island, those challenges won't go away.",
      "Trump has prioritized breaking China's stranglehold on the global supply of rare earths ever since the world's number two economy sharply restricted who could buy them after the United States imposed widespread tariffs last spring. The Trump administration has invested hundreds of millions of dollars and even taken stakes in several companies. Now the president is again pitching the idea that wresting control of Greenland away from Denmark could solve the problem.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do something on Greenland whether they like it or not,\u201d Trump said Friday.",
      "But Greenland may not be able to produce rare earths for years \u2014 if ever. Some companies are trying anyway, but their efforts to unearth some of the 1.5 million tons of rare earths encased in rock in Greenland generally haven't advanced beyond the exploratory stage. Trump's fascination with the island nation may be more about countering Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic than securing any of the hard-to-pronounce elements like neodymium and terbium that are used to produce the high-powered magnets needed in electric vehicles, wind turbines, robots and fighter jets among other products.",
      "\u201cThe fixation on Greenland has always been more about geopolitical posturing \u2014 a military-strategic interest and stock-promotion narrative \u2014 than a realistic supply solution for the tech sector,\u201d said Tracy Hughes, founder and executive director of the Critical Minerals Institute. \u201cThe hype far outstrips the hard science and economics behind these critical minerals.\"",
      "Trump confirmed those geopolitical concerns at the White House Friday.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want Russia or China going to Greenland, which if we don\u2019t take Greenland, you can have Russia or China as your next door neighbor. That\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Trump said",
      "The main challenge to mine in Greenland is, \u201cof course, the remoteness. Even in the south where it\u2019s populated, there are few roads and no railways, so any mining venture would have to create these accessibilities,\u201d said Diogo Rosa, an economic geology researcher at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. Power would also have to be generated locally, and expert manpower would have to be brought in.",
      "Another concern is the prospect of mining rare earths in the fragile Arctic environment just as Greenland tries to build a thriving tourism industry, said Patrick Schr\u00f6der, a senior fellow in the Environment and Society program at the Chatham House think-tank in London.",
      "\u201cToxic chemicals needed to separate the minerals out from the rock, so that can be highly polluting and further downstream as well, the processing,\" Shr\u00f6der said. Plus, rare earths are often found alongside radioactive uranium.",
      "Besides the unforgiving climate that encases much of Greenland under layers of ice and freezes the northern fjords for much of the year, the rare earths found there tend to be encased in a complex type of rock called eudialyte, and no one has ever developed a profitable process to extract rare earths from that type of rock. Elsewhere, these elements are normally found in different rock formation called carbonatites, and there are proven methods to work with that.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re in a race for resources \u2014 for critical minerals \u2014 then we should be focusing on the resources that are most easily able to get to market,\" said David Abraham, a rare earths expert who has followed the industry for decades and wrote the book \u201cThe Elements of Power.\u201d",

      "Even the most promising projects can struggle to turn a profit, particularly when China resorts to dumping extra materials onto the market to depress prices and drive competitors out of business as it has done many times in the past. And currently most critical minerals have to be processed in China.",
      "The U.S. is scrambling to expand the supply of rare earths outside of China during the one-year reprieve from even tougher restrictions that Trump said Xi Jinping agreed to in October. A number of companies around the world are already producing rare earths or magnets and can deliver more quickly than anything in Greenland, which Trump has threatened to seize with military power if Denmark doesn't agree to sell it.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s just been running to get to this endpoint. And if you go to Greenland, it\u2019s like you\u2019re going back to the beginning,\u201d said Ian Lange, an economics professor who focuses on rare earths at the Colorado School of Mines.",
      "Many in the industry, too, think America should focus on helping proven companies instead of trying to build new rare earth mines in Greenland, Ukraine, Africa or elsewhere. A number of other mining projects in the U.S. and friendly nations like Australia are farther along and in much more accessible locations.",

      "Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Daniel Walker Howe has died at 88",
      "NEW YORK -- Daniel Walker Howe, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian whose \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d became a widely acclaimed chronicle of the vast technological and social changes in the U.S. in the first half of the 19th century, has died at age 88.",
      "Walker died on Dec. 25, according to a spokesman for the University of California, Los Angeles, where he was a professor emeritus. Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "Awarded the Pulitzer in 2008, \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d was part of the Oxford University Press' ambitious and decades-long series on American history, with other works including such Pulitzer winners as David M. Kennedy's book on the Great Depression and World War II, \u201cFreedom from Fear,\u201d and James M. McPherson's Civil War epic \u201cThe Battle Cry of Freedom.\u201d",
      "Howe's 900-page book covered 1815-1848, from the end of the War of 1812 to the dawn of organized feminism in the U.S. \u2014 the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848. Howe traced the steady expansion west of a young country abiding by the doctrine of \u201cManifest Destiny.\u201d He documented the rise of Andrew Jackson and modern political parties, the overturning of the elite order that had controlled the presidency since George Washington, and the ongoing debate over slavery that would lead to armed conflict.",
      "The country was facing changes familiar to 21st century Americans. In the years leading up to the Civil War, the U.S. became more industrialized, more entwined and more divided. Information was traveling faster; the title \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d was taken from the biblical phrase used for the first telegraph message, sent in 1844. Newspapers and books were proliferating thanks to cheaper printing and to more efficient mail service, and the infrastructure was being modernized through roads, bridges, canals and other public works projects.",
      "At the same time, the more technology advanced, the more resistance arose in the South, where leading politicians opposed the new projects \u2014 \"internal improvements\u201d \u2014 for fear they would undermine slavery.",
      "\u201cInternal improvements could be opposed for reasons that had nothing to do with their economic effects. There were those who felt their stake in the status quo threatened by any innovation, especially intervention sponsored by the federal government,\u201d Howe wrote.",
      "Reviewing the book for The New Yorker in 2007, historian Jill Lepore praised it as \u201ca heroic attempt at synthesizing a century and a half of historical writing.\u201d She also noted that \u201cWhat God Hath Wrought\u201d was not the first choice for Oxford editor C. Vann Woodward, the prize-winning Southern historian.",
      "\u201cWhat God Hath Wrought\u201d was, in part, a response to another acclaimed work: Charles Sellers\u2019 landmark \u201cThe Market Revolution: Jacksonian America, 1815-1846.\u201d Woodward had asked Sellers to contribute to the Oxford series but turned down \u201cThe Market Revolution\u201d because he found it too negative. Released by Oxford as a separate volume in 1991, Sellers\u2019 book contended that advances in technology uprooted rural communities and livelihoods and portrayed Jackson as an opposing force who stood \u2014 in vain \u2014 for working people against the industrial powers.",

      "Howe had studied under Sellers at the University of California, Berkeley in the 1960s, but he formed a different view of the country\u2019s past. He found that innovation served less as a destroyer of old ties than as a force for democracy. He dedicated \u201cWhat God Hath Wrought\u201d to the patrician John Quincy Adams, Jackson\u2019s bitter rival in presidential elections and his opposite in personal background.",
      "\u201cBefore I wrote this book I had never really grasped how often improvements in material terms fostered improvements in moral terms,\" Howe told the National Review in 2007. \u201cThe people who encouraged economic diversification and development in many cases also supported more humane laws, wider access to education, a halt to the expansion of slavery, even, sometimes, greater equality for women.\u201d",
      "Howe's other books included \u201cThe Unitarian Conscience: Harvard Moral Philosophy 1805-1861,\u201d \u201cThe Political Culture of the American Whigs\u201d and \u201cMaking the American Self: Jonathan Edwards to Abraham Lincoln.\u201d He taught at several schools, starting with Yale University in 1966 and continuing at UCLA from 1973-93 and Oxford University from 1993-2002. He married Sandra Fay Shumway in 1961 and had three children: Christopher, Rebecca and Stephen.",
      "Born in Ogden, Utah, and raised in Denver, he recalled loving history since age 6 when his father told him about \"Hannibal crossing the Alps with elephants to fight the Romans,\u201d as he told The Harvard Crimson in 2009. He majored in history and literature at Harvard University and received his doctorate in history from Berkeley in 1966.",
      "Howe has said that being asked to write \u201cWhat Hath God Wrought\u201d appealed to him for the chance to write for general readers, and not just historians. His intention was to craft an old-fashioned narrative while drawing upon more recent scholarship on social movements, presenting the country's history as an ongoing debate over whether success was defined by military and economic power or by moral achievements.",
      "\u201cIn 1848, it seemed that the greatness of the American people had been shown in their extensive recent conquest across the continent. Later, that greatness could seem affirmed by the preservation of the Union, industrial might, commercial influence, scientific research, and victories over global enemies,\u201d he wrote.",
      "\u201cLater still, perhaps that greatness might be seen in the extent to which the dreams of the 1848 feminists and abolitionists have at length been realized. History works on a long time scale, and at any given moment we can perceive directions but imperfectly.\u201d",

      "Prisoners are now taking regular trips to far-flung, exotic locales such as Thailand",
      "CHOWCHILLA, Calif. -- Jacob Smith has been in prison for two decades but he and other inmates are still taking regular trips to far-flung, exotic locales. No passport required, just a virtual reality headset.",
      "\u201cI went to Thailand, man!\u201d Smith recalled with a grin, describing the first time he strapped on a VR device and was transported to the lush landscapes and bustling markets of Southeast Asia.",
      "A Los Angeles-based nonprofit is bringing the technology to California prisons with the goal of providing inmates a brief escape and, more importantly, exposure to real world scenarios that will prepare them to reenter society.",
      "During a weeklong program last month, incarcerated men at Valley State Prison near Fresno sat on metal folding chairs in a common area. They shuffled in their seats as they were outfitted with the headsets that resemble opaque goggles. Their necks contorted slightly and smiles spread across their faces as the high-definition videos started and their journeys commenced.",
      "Some saw the sights on the other side of the globe, including Bangkok, while others experienced more practical scenes, such as job interviews. The men sit across virtual desks from virtual interviewers who are both easygoing and hard-nosed to give them the tools for finding employment once they're released.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of us, the workforce has changed and things are different with the application process,\u201d said Smith, who is eligible for parole in 2031 and now volunteers helping his fellow inmates navigate the VR experience. \u201cIt\u2019s a nerve wracking experience going to sit in front of somebody and telling them why I\u2019m good for the job.\u201d",
      "Afterward, volunteers help the inmates process the emotions or traumas that bubbled up during their experiences. Sabra Williams, founder of the nonprofit Creative Acts, calls the VR devices a \u201chope machine.\u201d",
      "The program stems from a prison arts project that Williams ran that incorporated theater, music, poetry, dance and painting. Watching incarcerated people become engaged in artistic pursuits made her wonder about other ways to \u201cbring the outside world inside.\"",
      "She heard from people who had left prison lamenting that technology had passed them by. They felt confounded by simple things like pumping gas, checking out at a supermarket, or going to the ATM.",
      "\u201cAnd what I hear from them is that it made them feel like they didn\u2019t belong, and that they only belong in prison,\u201d she said.",
      "First Williams' group dug for footage on YouTube to recreate everyday activities. Soon they were creating their own videos focusing on travel, constructive scenarios, civic engagement, conflict resolution, art, and even meditation \u201cto blow their minds and also educate their minds.\u201d",
      "Such technology could have an important role to play in rehabilitation and, especially, reintegration into society, said Nancy La Vigne, the dean of Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice in New Jersey. She envisions people who haven't been in the real world for a long time using VR to act out navigating the DMV or figuring out how to take a city bus.",

      "Another benefit could be a calming effect on stressed out inmates. La Vigne points to research published by the American Psychological Association that found that incarcerated people who viewed short nature videos showed reduced levels of aggression and were subject to fewer discipline reports.",
      "But with a hefty price tag and limited access, La Vigne worries about the \u201cpractical realities,\" such as unintended consequences that stem from those who might be left out of the VR experience.",
      "\u201cYou can't just hand them out or sell them at commissary,\u201d La Vigne said.",
      "A former inmate, Richard Richard, first used a VR headset about six years ago when the program was launched and since his release has become a volunteer for Creative Acts. He said he's impressed by how far the technology has advanced. He loves watching his fellow inmates use the devices for the first time and then progress as they deal with trauma and emotional issues.",
      "\u201cYou may physically be here, but mentally, spiritually you can actually transcend this environment,\u201d he said.",
      "The group conducts the program, using 100 Oculus headsets donated by Meta, both in general population and in solitary confinement. Youth offenders are also eligible. It currently runs three times a year at four California prisons, and Williams hopes to expand it throughout the state and across the country.",
      "The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation didn't immediately respond this week to inquiries about plans to expand the program. But in announcing the introduction of VR at the California Men's Colony prison in San Luis Obispo County last August, the department said the usage has the potential \u201cto heal trauma, regulate emotional response, and prepare for a safe, successful reentry into society.\u201d",
      "The introductory two-minute trip to Thailand is often emotional for many inmates, some of whom had \u201cnever been off their block, let alone out the country,\u201d Williams said.",
      "\u201cAnd so many times people would take off the headsets and they\u2019d be crying,\" she said. \"Because they\u2019d be like, \u2018I never knew the world was so beautiful.\u2019\u201d",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened Greenland and says Washington must take control of the strategically located island",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump wants to own Greenland. He has repeatedly said the United States must take control of the strategically located and mineral-rich island, which is a semiautonomous region that's part of NATO ally Denmark.",
      "Officials from Denmark, Greenland and the United States met Thursday in Washington and will meet again next week to discuss a renewed push by the White House, which is considering a range of options, including using military force, to acquire the island.",

      "If it's not done \u201cthe easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" he said without elaborating what that could entail. In an interview Thursday, he told The New York Times that he wants to own Greenland because \u201cownership gives you things and elements that you can\u2019t get from just signing a document.\u201d",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an American takeover of Greenland would mark the end of NATO, and Greenlanders say they don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "This is a look at some of the ways the U.S. could take control of Greenland and the potential challenges.",
      "Trump and his officials have indicated they want to control Greenland to enhance American security and explore business and mining deals. But Imran Bayoumi, an associate director at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security, said the sudden focus on Greenland is also the result of decades of neglect by several U.S. presidents towards Washington's position in the Arctic.",
      "The current fixation is partly down to \u201cthe realization we need to increase our presence in the Arctic, and we don\u2019t yet have the right strategy or vision to do so,\u201d he said.",
      "If the U.S. took control of Greenland by force, it would plunge NATO into a crisis, possibly an existential one.",
      "While Greenland is the largest island in the world, it has a population of around 57,000 and doesn't have its own military. Defense is provided by Denmark, whose military is dwarfed by that of the U.S.",

      "\u201cIf the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\u201d Frederiksen has said.",
      "Trump said he needs control of the island to guarantee American security, citing the threat from Russian and Chinese ships in the region, but \u201cit's not true\u201d said Lin Mortensgaard, an expert on the international politics of the Arctic at the Danish Institute for International Studies, or DIIS.",
      "While there are probably Russian submarines \u2014 as there are across the Arctic region \u2014 there are no surface vessels, Mortensgaard said. China has research vessels in the Central Arctic Ocean, and while the Chinese and Russian militaries have done joint military exercises in the Arctic, they have taken place closer to Alaska, she said.",
      "Bayoumi, of the Atlantic Council, said he doubted Trump would take control of Greenland by force because it\u2019s unpopular with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, and would likely \u201cfundamentally alter\u201d U.S. relationships with allies worldwide.",
      "The U.S. already has access to Greenland under a 1951 defense agreement, and Denmark and Greenland would be \u201cquite happy\u201d to accommodate a beefed up American military presence, Mortensgaard said.",
      "For that reason, \u201cblowing up the NATO alliance\u201d for something Trump has already, doesn\u2019t make sense, said Ulrik Pram Gad, an expert on Greenland at DIIS.",

      "It's not clear how much that would improve upon Washington's current security strategy. The U.S. already operates the remote Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, and can bring as many troops as it wants under existing agreements.",
      "Greenlandic politician Aaja Chemnitz told The Associated Press that Greenlanders want more rights, including independence, but don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "Gad suggested influence operations to persuade Greenlanders to join the U.S. would likely fail. He said that is because the community on the island is small and the language is \u201cinaccessible.\u201d",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen summoned the top U.S. official in Denmark in August to complain that \u201cforeign actors\u201d were seeking to influence the country\u2019s future. Danish media reported that at least three people with connections to Trump carried out covert influence operations in Greenland.",
      "Even if the U.S. managed to take control of Greenland, it would likely come with a large bill, Gad said. That\u2019s because Greenlanders currently have Danish citizenship and access to the Danish welfare system, including free health care and schooling.",
      "To match that, \u201cTrump would have to build a welfare state for Greenlanders that he doesn\u2019t want for his own citizens,\u201d Gad said.",
      "Since 1945, the American military presence in Greenland has decreased from thousands of soldiers over 17 bases and installations to 200 at the remote Pituffik Space Base in the northwest of the island, Rasmussen said last year. The base supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.",
      "U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance told Fox News on Thursday that Denmark has neglected its missile defense obligations in Greenland, but Mortensgaard said that it makes \u201clittle sense to criticize Denmark,\u201d because the main reason why the U.S. operates the Pituffik base in the north of the island is to provide early detection of missiles.",
      "The best outcome for Denmark would be to update the defense agreement, which allows the U.S. to have a military presence on the island and have Trump sign it with a \u201cgold-plated signature,\u201d Gad said.",
      "But he suggested that's unlikely because Greenland is \u201chandy\u201d to the U.S president.",
      "When Trump wants to change the news agenda \u2014 including distracting from domestic political problems \u2014 \u201che can just say the word \u2018Greenland' and this starts all over again,\" Gad said.",

    "summary": "The star of \"The Gilded Age\" and \"The White Lotus\" has returned to Broadway in \"Bug,\" written by her playwright-actor husband. The two talk about their on- and off-stage partnership.",
    "story": [
      "Safe to say, after recent star turns in \"The Gilded Age\" and the monologue of the year about friendship in \"The White Lotus,\" Carrie Coon is having a moment.",
      "I asked her, \"Would you agree with me that where you used to say you're at the bottom of the A-List \u2026\"",
      "\"I think I used to say, 'The bottom of the B-List,' but yeah,\" she corrected.",
      "\"But don't we need to revise our assessment as where you are?\"",
      "\"Maybe,\" said Coon. \"But the thing that's changed for me is that I was on 'The White Lotus,' and now I can be in a Broadway play. That wasn't true for me five years ago.\"",
      "The play is \"Bug,\" which opened just this past week. Coon is leveraging her newfound star power to play the demanding, harrowing lead role in this examination of paranoia, conspiracy, and loneliness. And she is adamant that her success should not obscure a larger, sadder reality of the theater these days: \"We live in a country that is fundamentally unsupportive of the arts. So now, in order to do a play on Broadway, you have to do 'The White Lotus,' or else you're not allowed. They have to replace you with somebody more famous.\"",
      "\"Hang on, if you hadn't done 'White Lotus' and 'Gilded Age' and hadn't sort of blown up as a star \u2026\"",
      "\"Yeah. We wouldn't be sitting here, absolutely not,\" Coon said.",
      "\"Your acting ability, what you do on stage, not enough?\" I asked.",
      "\"No, that's not how we make those decisions anymore,\" she said. \"And you can ask all these extraordinary theater actors who don't do plays anymore because celebrities are doing plays. It's just a different world that we're living in now.\"",
      "Tracy Letts is the playwright of \"Bug.\" He's in love with Coon's fearlessness. \"She has ice water in her veins,\" he said. \"In another life, she'd make a great assassin.\"",
      "He's in love with her acting chops. \"She's a great stage actress,\" he said. \"For the people who've only seen her do 'Gilded Age' or 'White Lotus,' they just don't know what a stage animal she is.\"",
      "Letts is in love with her. He and Coon have been married for the last dozen years.",
      "I asked, \"Your partners, your life partners, they had to be theatre people, right? Because it's such a consuming world?\"",
      "\"I came to that conclusion a long time ago that, whoever my partner was had to be in the profession; civilians just don't get it,\" Letts laughed. \"They just don't get it. It's a hard life.\"",
      "A couple of Midwesterners (Coon is from Ohio, Letts from Oklahoma), they met in 2010 doing \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" at the Steppenwolf Theatre in Chicago. Letts said, \"We had a palpable attraction to each other. We just wanted to be with each other.\"",
      "Coon said, \"When we confessed to our director and our castmates that we were officially together, they were like, 'Yeah. Of course.' We thought it was shocking, this shocking revel \u2013 [and they're] like, 'Yeah, hello! We've been here the whole time.'\"",
      "When the show got to Broadway in 2013, Letts won a best actor Tony. That's some impressive artistic range, considering his Pulitzer Prize for writing the play \"August: Osage County\" in 2008, and his steady presence in film and TV for the last several decades, from \"Seinfeld\" and \"The Big Short\" to \"A House of Dynamite.\"",
      "He's been around a while. Coon noted, \"Tracy's entering into sort of this \u2026\"",
      "\"Oldness?\" Letts offered.",
      "Letts is now 60; Coon is 44.",
      "\"He always gave me room to grow, because I was not in the same place in my life as him,\" Coon said. \"Like, what you're sitting in contemplation of at this stage in your life is different than where I am in mine.\"",
      "So, how does that meld? \"Oh, a lotta jokes,\" said Coon. \"Like, 'Your second husband's gonna love this couch.'\"",
      "Whether playwright and actor, or husband and wife, what makes this partnership work, they told us, is honest feedback and mutual respect. Letts said, \"She knows I'm gonna tell her the truth. She'll put on a dress and say, 'How does this look?' And I'll say, 'It doesn't look good.'\"",
      "\"No, no, no, no\u2026.\" I said.",
      "\"It's true!\" Letts reiterated. \"And she appreciates it, because she knows I'm not lying to her.\"",
      "\"Isn't rule number one of husbanding, Not bad? Which we all know means\u2026 \"",
      "\"No. We don't do that,\" Letts said. \"So when she puts on something and I go, 'You look fantastic,' or when she's in this play and I say, 'My God, you're a great actress,' she knows I'm not bulls****ing her.\"",
      "Later, I asked Coon, \"If you have something to say, whether it's praise or criticism, you know it's the truth?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied. \"Even with things I wear.\"",
      "Letts smiled. \"See?!\"",
      "While any couple might recognize that trust required to navigate life's challenges, Letts and Coon's \"moment\" is providing some uncommon tests. Take Coon landing the \"White Lotus\" role: \"I turned to Tracy and I said, 'There's no way I can go away to Thailand for six months.' We had a three-year-old and a six-year-old. And Tracy was the one who turned to me and he said, 'We're gonna figure this out.'",
      "\"Tracy was doing every morning. He was doing dinner and bedtime every night, and bath time by himself. So that was a really hard six months.\"",
      "\"I wasn't doing anything extraordinary; I was taking care of the kids while she was gone doing a job,\" he said.",
      "\"We know when the undeniable thing comes along, and we'll both make room for that to happen,\" Coon said.",
      "Which is why this chance to collaborate on Broadway is so important for them. The best way to handle a whirlwind is to find a place to anchor. For these two, that's always been the theater.",
      "\"This is where we're most comfortable,\" Letts said, \"in a rehearsal room preparing this on a stage, doing this in a theater. This is what we know. You just have a sense of accomplishment and gratification in the theater. You've told a story over the course of the night. You don't get to do that when you make a film or TV show.\"",
      "Carrie Coon and Tracy Letts are a couple now living in some of the culture's brightest lights.\u00a0 But they're theater people \u2013 bright lights don't faze them.\u00a0 \"I got my first credit card at 43,\" Letts laughed. \"It's a tough gig!\"",
      "Besides, they have work to do, the kind that's most affirming for them: Work they can do together.",
      "Letts said, \"I needed somebody who understood what it means to be an artist in America.\"",
      "\"And I needed somebody who reminded me that it was important to be an artist,\" Coon said, \"and that it was powerful, and necessary.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 13:52:27 -0500",
    "summary": "For years, she seemed powerless against a fluctuating weight problem, until new medications, and a new attitude, gave Oprah Winfrey a breakthrough. She talks with Jane Pauley about \"Enough,\" a new book co-written with Dr. Ania Jastreboff, about her weight-loss success.",
    "story": [
      "Our first question to Oprah Winfrey: \"You always wear really beautiful clothes. Always have. And I wonder if it's a joy to get dressed now?\"",
      "\"I can tell you what a joy it is to actually pack clothes that you know are gonna fit and you're gonna feel good in them,\" Winfrey replied. \"I mean, it is a joy to get dressed. That is such a powerful first question, Jane Pauley, really!\"",
      "Powerful is one of the superlatives befitting Oprah Winfrey, one of the best-known and most-admired people on the planet, and one of the richest. But for all her success, she seemed powerless against a weight problem, a deeply personal struggle she has waged publicly and openly.",
      "In 1985, when her talk show, \"AM Chicago,\" was getting national attention, Oprah appeared on \"The Tonight Show\" with guest host Joan Rivers.",
      "\"And I'm sitting there, and we're toward the end of the interview, and Joan turns to me and, 'So, tell me, you know, how'd you gain the weight?'\" Oprah recalled. Her response? \"I ate a lot.\"",
      "\"I was stunned in that moment, when I look back and I see that moment. But I left feeling humiliated and embarrassed, but not the least bit anger, not the least bit of anger or being upset about it,\" she said.",
      "Why? \"Because I thought, 'She's right.'\"",
      "Over the next 40 years, Oprah would gain and lose hundreds of pounds. In the fall of 1988, after a strict four-month liquid diet, a new svelte Oprah appeared wearing size 10 Calvins, weighing 145, and pulling a wagon with 67 pounds of animal fat",
      "It was all back, plus 25 more, when she went to the Daytime Emmy Awards four years later. \"And I go to the Emmys praying not to win, literally praying not to win, because I don't want to have to get up out of my seat and have everybody watch me do that walk to the stage,\" she said.",
      "She started over again the next day, working out with an on-call personal trainer this time. In 1994 she even ran a marathon.",
      "Oprah knew how to lose weight \u2026 she did it over and over. She says her body was seeking a range of 211 to 218. \"So usually, by the time I would hit 211 when I first went on the diet for the wagon of fat and pulled out the wagon of fat, when I did my first marathon, once I get to 211, I go, 'Oh, I gotta do something.' But now I understand that the biology of me, which is different than the biology of you and everybody else \u2013 every body, all of us, has our own \u2013 but no matter what I did, no matter how hard I worked, no matter what, it was always trying to get my body back to 211.\"",
      "Not because 211 is her ideal weight, but rather a \"set point\": a genetically-influenced weight range. Oprah calls it the \"enough point.\"",
      "\"Enough\" is also the title of a new book she co-wrote with Dr. Ania Jastreboff from the Yale School of Medicine, who says, for most people, an enough point is \"the weight that they kind of always gravitate to.\"",
      "So, to lose weight, you cut back on calories, and start craving high-fat food , or you eat less \u2013 but nothing changes. \"Our body's like, 'Well, if you're gonna eat less, then I'm gonna make you more efficient. I'm gonna make you burn less,'\" said Jastreboff. \"So what happens is, together, collectively, we end up eating more, and burning less.\"",
      "\"It's the enemy within, which is in our brains,\" I said. \"So, now that we know what the problem is, the hormones that drive people, why don't people just stop obeying it?\"",
      "\"That would be like trying to control something that is not in your control,\" Jastreboff said. \"That would be like holding your breath for the rest of your life. Every time somebody says, 'Just eat less, move more,' we're asking our patients to control their biology and hold their breath. And it's just not possible. And why would we do that? We don't do that for any other disease.\"",
      "And that's what the American Medical Association says obesity is \u2014 a disease. A treatable disease. But the good news is that, if it's a disease, it's not your fault.",
      "\"It's not my fault, Jane! It's not my fault,\" Oprah said. \"And I could weep right now, could weep right now. I'm not going to! But I could weep right now for all of the many days and nights I journaled about this being my fault, and why can't I conquer this thing?\"",
      "In the last decade, nearly a dozen weight management drugs have been approved for chronic weight management.\u00a0 And for millions, drugs like GLP--1s are the answer to their prayers. Finally, a scientifically-supported, medically-approved weight-loss strategy that worked. And yet, Oprah resisted. \"I was so motivated by shame that I felt I could not take the drug,\" she said, \"because if I took the drug \u2013 I, who had been the poster child for I can do it, I can do it, I can do it, willpower, willpower, let's just get more willpower \u2013 if I couldn't do it, then I would be shamed, and ashamed of myself for not being able to do it myself.\"",
      "The medications don't work for everyone, and some can't tolerate side effects ranging from nausea to gallstones. But it's been two years since Oprah finally started medication, and it's working for her. She says she is now down to her marathon weight of 155. \"And so, that's it for me. I'm gonna just try to maintain,\" she said.",
      "\"Well done. Because I thought 160 was your goal weight?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, it was,\" Oprah said, \"but as I continue to work out here the combination of the medication and hiking every day and resistance training has given me the body that I had when I was running a marathon. So, I was 40 and feeling really good, but to be able to be 71 and feel that I am in the best shape of my life feels better than it did when I was 40.\"",
      "\"I would submit that you would have been a phenomenal success, but I don't think you would have become 'Oprah' if you hadn't had the weight issue and been open about it and shared it,\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah. I would agree with that,\" she said. \"And that's why I don't have any regrets about it. There's a wonderful spiritual, African American spiritual, called, 'I Wouldn't Take Nothing For My Journey Now.'",
      "I wouldn't take nothing for my journey nowfor my journey nowfor my journey nowI wouldn't take nothing for my journey now.",
      "\"I wouldn't change the journey,\" she said. \"because I think the struggle with the weight actually helped me be more relatable and relate more to other people who were in their own struggles. But I'm glad now to be in a position where I feel the healthiest and strongest I have ever been.\"",
      "READ AN EXCERPT:\u00a0\"Enough\" by Dr. Ania Jastreboff and Oprah Winfrey",
      "\"I feel free\"",
      "Oprah Winfrey grew up riding on dirt roads. Now, on her sprawling Montecito estate near Santa Barbara, California, she owns the road.\u00a0 She took me for a ride: \"This used to belong to my neighbor,\" Oprah said. \"So, this is 23 acres. Her house used to be right there. We took this fence down, so this became my whole backyard, this.\"",
      "Around here, all of the views are spectacular, especially the one looking back.",
      "Born in Mississippi in 1954, Oprah Winfrey was a teen beauty queen who became a local TV reporter in Nashville, and then an anchor in Baltimore. \"The beautiful thing about my life was that I started out in local television, as you did,\" Oprah said. \"And when you start out locally, you get this, like, little teeny-tiny thing. But I failed. I failed in Baltimore.",
      "\"They brought me in as a 22-year-old with an anchor guy, white-haired Jerry Turner, who was the most popular local anchor in the country, not just Baltimore. And he totally hated me. He resented me. He would do everything he could to condescend to me any way. I remember one time we were on the set and he said to me, 'So, you're from Mississippi? Can you name all the tributaries of the Mississippi River?'",
      "\"And I was, like, 'All the tributaries of the Mississippi River? No, I can't.' He goes, 'Well, what school did you go to?' 'Well, I went to Tennessee State.' 'Was that an accredited school? So, you got a degree?' I mean, that kind of thing. This is in-between the commercial breaks.\"",
      "\"Boy, that happened to me in Chicago,\" I said. \"Started in September, basically was taken off the late news in the spring.\"",
      "Maybe we share a few things. I was a shy kid from Indiana who started as a local reporter in Indianapolis, and wound up on national TV \u2013 and Oprah was watching. \"You were such an inspiration. I remember calling Gayle that morning, 'Oh my God.' It just, it was unbelievable.\"",
      "\"Well, that I inspired you!\"",
      "But Oprah famously went on to build her worldwide media empire, and a following that some world leaders can only dream of.",
      "I asked, \"You have such power. Now that you are this woman undeterred by weight \u2013 'weight noise' \u2013 what are you gonna do?\"",
      "\"That's a beautiful question, but I don't feel compelled to do anything,\" Oprah replied. \"I don't know what it means actually, other than I feel free.\"",
      "And what about her name being credibly bandied about for the presidency? \"No, it's not gonna happen,\" she said. \"What I really want to do is to continue to use who I am and what that represents as a force in the world, as a force for good, and to allow people to not let the noises of the world steal their joy.\"",
      "\"You are such a person of positivity!\"",
      "\"I am indeed,\" she agreed.",
      "For all of her astonishing success, it seems that Oprah is still always aware of how far she's come \u2013 how she became something so much bigger than television. \"I have to say, there's a wonderful poem by Countee Cullen called 'Yet Do I Marvel.' And I would have to say, yet do I marvel at that, myself,\" she said.",
      "\"Sometimes in the early spring, the frogs are in the pond, and I can open the door and I can hear the frogs out at night. And it sounds just like Mississippi, being on the porch in Mississippi. But the distance from Mississippi to Montecito cannot be measured. It just cannot be measured. And I marvel at, how did this happen? How did it happen that I was able to navigate the waters of racism and sexism and misogynism and all the things that we had to endure? Yet do I marvel!\"",
      "And marvelous, it is.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-art-of-anselm-kiefer-becoming-the-sea/",
    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:28:07 -0500",
    "summary": "One of the world's most prolific living artists is now the subject of a retrospective in St. Louis. He talks about how rivers cutting through America's Midwest, and a Beat Generation poet, inspired his three-story-tall abstract canvases.",
    "story": [
      "Even on a casual walk, German artist Anselm Kiefer is always searching for inspiration. \"Look at this tree,\" he said walking alongside the Mississippi River. \"This is a fantastic tree, you know?\"",
      "And here in St. Louis, Missouri, it's an American river that's fired his imagination. He said, \"This river goes through America, and so with this conscience I have an inner overview of America, of the continent, of the world.\"",
      "Kiefer has turned those reflections into a series of paintings, each three stories tall. They are now holding court at the Saint Louis Art Museum, home to an Anselm Kiefer retrospective. Dozens of Kiefer works are on display, but it's these monumental canvases that are the showstoppers.",
      "The paintings depict the Mississippi and Europe's Rhine River \u2013 waterways brimming with history, symbolizing the cycle of life. Kiefer said the inspiration for their name, \"Becoming the Sea,\" came from Beat Generation poet Gregory Corso: \"Spirit is life \u2026 like a river unafraid of becoming the sea.\"",
      "\"You know, a river is something special; a river dissolves itself in the sea,\" he said. \"And it's not afraid of this. As I am not afraid of my death, you know?\"",
      "Mortality is a common theme for Kiefer. Born in 1945 in Germany, he grew up in the ruins of World War II, and the aftermath of the Holocaust. It's a chapter many Germans tried to forget. \"You know, after the war, there was not so much knowledge about what happened,\" he said. \"The Germans, they put it underneath the carpet. Nobody spoke about [it].\"",
      "Kiefer spent his career breaking through that silence, like when, as a young art student, he photographed himself giving the Nazi salute, not as an endorsement, but as a reckoning.",
      "Asked about the role of the artist in society, he said, \"If the artist is in the world, like I am in the world, as I look what happens, then automatically you have a role.\"",
      "Over the decades, Kiefer continued to explore themes of memory and loss \u2013 mostly with abstract landscapes, and materials. As Kiefer showed \"Sunday Morning\" in 2018, at his studio outside of Paris, melted lead and fire are normal sightings in his work. So is a bit of chemistry, creating unexpected colors.",
      "Today, Kiefer is one of the most prolific living artists, at the peak of his career, with works selling for millions, and in museums around the world. It would be a proud moment for most, but Anselm Kiefer has always had his own way of seeing things.",
      "I asked him, \"So at 80, what are you most proud of in terms of the work you've done?\"",
      "\"You ask strange questions! I am not proud. I am disappointed!\" he laughed. \"I'm really disappointed. Because every morning I go in the studio and say, 'Oh, what I have done yesterday?' You know, and then I continue. I continue. Proud? No, no. I don't know this word for me, proud.\"",

    "summary": "Bob Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Grateful Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Saturday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\" his family wrote in a post to his Instagram page. \"He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\"",
      "In the statement, the family disclosed that Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July.",
      "\"As we remember Bobby, it's hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived,\" his family wrote. \"A man driftin' and dreamin', never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.\"",
      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
      "The group eventually reformed a few years after Garcia's death and took many iterations over the years, the latest as Dead & Company.",
      "\"For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\" his family's statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music. His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them.\"",
      "Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concert's for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \"Touch of Grey,\" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\"I venture to say they are the great American band,\" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \"What a wonder they are.\"",

      "Authorities in New Mexico issued an arrest warrant Friday for director and Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield to face a child sex abuse charge.",
      "An investigator with the Albuquerque Police Department filed a criminal complaint in support of the charge, which says a child reported that Busfield touched him inappropriately. The acts allegedly occurred on the set of \"The Cleaning Lady,\" a TV series that Busfield directed and acted in.",
      "The child said the first incident happened when he was 7 years old and Busfield touched him three or four times. Busfield allegedly touched him five or six times on another occasion when he was 8.",
      "The child's mother reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney and agent did not immediately respond to email messages seeking comment late Friday.",
      "The arrest warrant, which was signed by a judge, said the charge is for two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.",
      "According to the complaint, the child, which it identifies only by his initials, has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. A social worker documented him saying he has had nightmares about Busfield touching him and woken up scared.",
      "The child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024, when the investigator responded to a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital. The child's parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "\"The Cleaning Lady\" aired for four seasons on Fox, ending in 2025. It starred Elodie Yung as a Cambodian doctor who comes to the United States to get medical treatment for her son, witnesses a mob killing and ends up becoming a cleaner for organized crime.",

      "A rare copy of the comic book that introduced the world to Superman \u2014 and was also once stolen from the home of actor Nicolas Cage \u2014 has been sold for a record $15 million.",
      "The private deal for \"Action Comics No. 1\" was announced Friday. It eclipses the previous record price for a comic book, set last November when a copy of \"Superman No. 1\u2033 was sold at auction for $9.12 million.",
      "The Action Comics sale was negotiated by Manhattan-based Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, which said the comic book's owner and the buyer wished to remain anonymous.",
      "The comic \u2014 which sold for 10 cents when it came out in 1938 \u2014 was an anthology of tales about mostly now little-known characters. But over a few panels, it told the origin story of Superman's birth on a dying planet, his journey to Earth and his decision as an adult to \"turn his titanic strength into channels that would benefit mankind.\"",
      "Its publication marked the beginning of the superhero genre. About 100 copies of Action Comics No. 1 are known to exist, according to Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect President Vincent Zurzolo.",
      "\"This is among the Holy Grail of comic books. Without Superman and his popularity, there would be no Batman or other superhero comic book legends,\" Zurzolo said. \"Its importance in the comic book community shows with his deal, as it obliterates the previous record.\"",
      "The comic book was stolen from Cage's Los Angeles home in 2000, but was recovered in 2011 when it was found by a man who had purchased the contents of an old storage locker in Southern California. It eventually was returned to Cage, who had bought it in 1996 for $150,000. Six months after it was returned to him, he sold it at auction for $2.2 million.",
      "Stephen Fishler, CEO of Metropolis Collectibles/Comic Connect, said the theft eventually played a big role in boosting the comic's value.",
      "\"During that 11-year period (it was missing), it skyrocketed in value,\" Fishler said. \"The thief made Nicolas Cage a lot of money by stealing it.\"",
      "Fishler compared it to the theft of Mona Lisa, which was stolen from the Louvre museum in Paris in 1911.",
      "\"It was kept under the thief's bed for two years,\" Fishler noted. \"The recovery of the painting made the Mona Lisa go from being just a great Da Vinci painting to a world icon \u2014 and that's what Action No. 1 is \u2014 an icon of American pop culture.\"",

      "In an interview Tuesday with \"CBS Mornings,\"\u00a0Glaser described the process of making jokes for the awards show as \"strategic,\" saying, \"you have to be very delicate about making jokes that aren't going to ruin anyone's night, but you also want to give the people at home \u2026 something to laugh at and you want to poke fun at the people that they're dying for you to make fun of.\"",
      "She added picking the perfect jokes for the show is \"one of \u2026 the most difficult jobs I've ever done.\"",
      "Glaser said she is a big fan of the celebrities up for awards and said this year is a little different because she grew up admiring many of the actors.",
      "\"It is easy for me to take down like, you know, the newer batch of actresses and actors who are younger than me. It is like, OK I can make fun of you, I'm like a veteran. But when it's like people I grew up admiring it's \u2026 oh, my gosh, it is so much \u2026 it is a different approach this year.\"",
      "While preparing last year, Glaser reached out to some celebrities to see if a joke went too far. She said she hasn't done this yet so far and may have a different strategy.",
      "\"There are certain people that I don't know what I would say. It is almost like some of these jokes, you think about, OK, if I got their number, would I write them and ask them? Then I go, you know what? They might say no and I know the joke isn't that mean, and \u2026 I would rather ask for forgiveness later at the after-party when they're drunk,\" she said with a laugh.",
      "As Glaser rehearses, she's found one joke that doesn't always connect with the audience.",
      "\"I'm trying out my monologue around L.A. at the clubs here, and just even any joke about Julia Roberts, they're not there for.

    "story": [
      "The largest nurses strike in New York City history has begun after negotiators for five major hospitals and the state nurses union failed to agree\u00a0to a new contract by Monday's deadline.",
      "The New York State Nurses Association said\u00a0nearly 15,000 nurses are now walking off their jobs at five privately-run hospitals, including Mount Sinai Hospital, Mount Sinai Morningside, Mount Sinai West and NewYork-Presbyterian in Manhattan, and Montefiore Einstein in the Bronx.",
      "NYSNA said nurses at Mount Sinai started the strike at 6 a.m., while nurses at the remaining hospitals started picketing an hour later.",
      "Montefiore said it was preparing for the strike to last multiple weeks.",
      "A Mount Sinai spokesperson said, \"Unfortunately, NYSNA decided to move forward with its strike while refusing to move on from its extreme economic demands, which we cannot agree to, but we are ready with 1,400 qualified and specialized nurses \u2013 and prepared to continue to provide safe patient care for as long as this strike lasts.\"",
      "A statement from NewYork-Presbyterian said, \"While NYSNA has told nurses to walk away from the bedside, we remain focused on our patients and their care. This strike is designed to create disruption, but we have taken the necessary steps so our patients continue to receive the care they trust us to provide ... We're ready to keep negotiating a fair and reasonable contract that reflects our respect for our nurses and the critical role they play, and also recognizes the challenging realities of today's healthcare environment.\"",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency in anticipation of the strike amid worries it could jeopardize critical care for thousands of patients in the city.",
      "\"I continue to urge both sides to remain at the table and reach an agreement as soon as possible,\" the governor said in a statement.",
      "Mamdani joins picket line",
      "New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani joined picketers outside NewYork-Presbyterian in Washington Heights.",
      "\"In every one of our city's darkest periods, nurses showed up to work. Their value is not negotiable and there worth is not up for debate,\" Mamdani said. \"They show up and all they are asking for in return is dignity, respect and the fair pay and treatment that they deserve. They should settle for nothing less.\"",
      "Mamdani released a similar statement the night before the strike on X.",
      "\"This city can and must ensure the continuity of care. FDNY, Emergency Management, the public health system and all of my senior leadership are working tirelessly to ensure nurses' demands for dignity can be heard and care is still received,\" the mayor said.",
      "Mamdani urged both sides to meet at the bargaining table.",
      "\"They must bargain in good faith and they must arrive at a deal that is satisfactory to all, that allows the nurses who work in this city to live in this city,\" he said.",
      "Why are nurses on strike?",
      "Both sides bargained\u00a0throughout the weekend, but were unable to make a deal.",
      "NYSNA has accused Montefiore, Mount Sinai and NewYork-Presbyterian  of putting profits over safe patient care.",
      "The union said the wealthiest hospital systems in the city are refusing to compromise on issues like pay raises, safe staffing levels, full health care coverage, pensions and workplace protections against violence.",
      "Cecilia Barreto, a registered nurse picketing outside Mount Sinai West, said striking was a last resort.",
      "\"I have been here to two years and I've made such great bonds with the nurses here, and I know that there are nurses who have battled cancer and depend on their health care. So we need to make sure that the health care we receive stays intact because their lives depend on it,\" Barreto said.",
      "\"Instead of guaranteeing health care for nurses, these wealthy hospitals are pushing to cut health benefits for nurses who put their own health on the line to care for New Yorkers,\" Nancy Hagans, president of NYSNA, said on Saturday.",
      "An earlier statement from Montefiore called some of the demands \"reckless and irresponsible.\"",
      "The hospitals all called the strike \"reckless\" in a joint statement accusing the nurses of abandoning patients.",
      "\"NYSNA leadership has chosen to abandon patients in their time of need, but Montefiore Medical Center, Mount Sinai, and NewYork-Presbyterian will not. Their decision to walk out on our patients can only be described as reckless,\" the hospitals said.",
      "Some hospitals in the area were able to\u00a0reach a deal\u00a0with NYSNA, including all of Northwell Health facilities in Nassau County, while others previously pulled back their\u00a0strike notices.",
      "What the strike means for patients",
      "Gov. Hochul last week signed executive orders to ensure the State Department of Health has staff at the impacted hospitals for the duration of the New York City nurses strike, ensuring patient safety and continuity of care.",
      "Montefiore said that emergency rooms will remain open.",
      "Hospital officials said no one should delay treatment or put off appointments, but patients should be alert for any direct updates from their health care providers.",
      "NYSNA also said patients should continue to seek care, with leaders at a news conference Sunday saying going to get care is not crossing a strike line.",
      "The bottom line for patients is that the hospitals will remain open and care will continue during the strike.",
      "Mamdani on nurses strike",
      "Mamdani acknowledged the impending strike Sunday night in a post on X. It read:",
      "The safety and wellbeing of this city is my top priority and ensuring New Yorkers have the care they need is critical, especially during flu season.",
      "The city's Emergency Management team, FDNY, health department, public hospital system, and my senior leadership team are in constant communication and closely monitoring the situation. We are prepared for any and all scenarios, including a strike.",
      "No New Yorker should have to fear losing access to health care \u2014 and no nurse should be asked to accept less pay, fewer benefits or less dignity for doing lifesaving work. Our nurses kept this city alive through its hardest moments. Their value is not negotiable.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 10:28:09 -0500",
    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

      "Enough Shame and Blame",
      "My patient Alice began experiencing self-blame in childhood. Her well-intentioned mom put her on diets when she was in her early teens. Even before that, she had started to develop what she eventually called the \"self-hatred voice.\" She vividly remembers when she was ten years old, sitting in the front yard with her legs bent, seeing the inside curvature of her leg and wanting it to be smaller. \"This is the line where your muscle is, and on the inside is a curve. That's the fat and the extra skin. I thought, 'Oh, if I could just cut that off, then my leg would be perfect.' I had a pen, and I drew the line where I thought my legs should be and where the fat should be cut off. I just knew that I was larger than I wanted to be.\" Alice lived in Vermont at the time, and her mother had a garden where she grew all sorts of vegetables\u2014lettuce, carrots, cucumbers. \"I just remember eating salad, so much salad!\" Alice recalls. At thirteen, she sat at the table, thinking, \"Here's a plate with three pieces of lettuce and a carrot,\" and wondering how she was going to get through basketball practice or soccer without passing out or blowing the game for her teammates.",
      "A few years later, her mother put herself and Alice on a no-carb diet. \"Atkins was kinda big,\" Alice says. Her father and two younger brothers were exempt; it was only for the girls of the family. Which basically meant Alice and her mother were still eating everything from the garden, except no turnips, because turnips had \"too many carbs.\"",
      "After three days, Alice revolted. She reached for some crackers in the cupboard: \"Mom, I just ate an entire sleeve of saltines!\" Hearing this, her mother was not upset with her. Alice shared, \"She was desperate for carbs, too, and ate three saltines herself. And then dutifully returned to her no-carb diet.\"",
      "At sixteen, Alice started tracking her weight for sports. The self-hatred voice in her mind began to be very specific and explicit. \"The cupcake you just ate\u2014what is the number of calories in it? What is the number of carbs?\" She described that it wouldn't let up, not even for just one tiny-teeny bite. It was unrelenting.",
      "Fast-forward more than thirty years, and by the time Alice was nearly fifty, she had tried every diet and workout program under the sun: forty-seven of them, to be exact. Atkins, keto, South Beach, the Zone, low carb, no carb, ultra-low fat, liquid only, Jillian Michaels, Jane Fonda, Suzanne Somers, full-body HIIT workouts, gym memberships, a YMCA weight coach, DietBet, StepBet, a Mediterranean diet, a vegetarian diet, the raw food diet, intermittent fasting. She'd even tried hypnosis. She had three teenagers, a fulfilling job in communications, and a loving boyfriend. She struggled with obesity despite spending much of her adult life tracking every morsel of food, eating mostly healthful meals, and exercising every day. She had successfully lost weight countless times. That wasn't the issue. The problem was that she always gained it back. She always blamed herself for having obesity. She did not know about the biology of obesity, yet.",

    "published": "Sun, 11 Jan 2026 09:19:39 -0500",
    "summary": "As millions of Americans struggle with paying for health care, doctors and health experts discuss how medical care is being eroded by insurers denying necessary tests and treatment, making it \"more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
    "story": [
      "Traci Hurley says watching her husband battle cancer in late 2021 was harrowing. \"It was heartbreaking, and it was awful,\" she said. \"I lived in fear every day.\"",
      "A battle made worse, she says, because so many of the skirmishes were with their insurance company. \"No family should have to go through having to fight to get treatment recommended by their physician covered, while fighting for their lives,\" she said.",
      "Millions of Americans say they are struggling to get medical care: either unable to pay sky-high deductibles, or, like Dan Hurley, denied coverage for tests and treatment by health insurance companies. Not only were both the Hurleys doctors; Dan, an ear, nose and throat surgeon, was also skilled in cutting through insurance red tape for his patients.",
      "\"And yet, we still ran into issues a lot,\" Traci said. \"If we, as two physicians, had to struggle the amount that we had to struggle to get care approved, what about people who do not have medical knowledge? What's happening to them every day?\"",
      "Dan was an avid hiker, until a nagging backache turned out to be cancer. He was diagnosed with chondrosarcoma, an ultra-rare bone tumor. To try to save his life, the tumor, along with Dan's hip, had to be removed. Insurance only covered a portion of the costs.",
      "Traci said, \"Many of his treatments were denied. We had PET scans, we had CT scans denied. We had chemotherapy, we had radiation, we had certain medications that required prior-authorization, and were denied.\"",
      "The basis for the insurers' denials, Traci said, was that they were \"not medically indicated.\"",
      "\"Make their lives as difficult as possible\"",
      "Ron Howrigon, now a consultant, spent two decades working for health insurance companies. \"Health insurance companies know that five percent of their members account for 50 percent of all the costs,\" he said. \"So, I have this huge financial incentive to make their lives as difficult as possible.\"",
      "Howrigon says the business model is unlike other industries: \"The more your customers use your product, the less money you make. Your incentive is to keep them from using your product.\"",
      "How often do insurance companies refuse to cover the cost of medical treatments? It's hard to tell; health insurance companies are only required to report denial data for plans purchased through healthcare.gov.",
      "A CBS News analysis of about 1.3 billion federal health insurance claims across three years shows that, in 2024, insurers denied 19% of in-network claims \u2013 about 1 in 5.",
      "But for the biggest insurer, United Healthcare, that was a steep drop from the preceding two years, when it denied as many as one-third of its federal claims.",
      "While it did not provide data to support it, United Healthcare says that, across all its plans, their initial denial rate is 10%. They also point out that when employers are self-insured, the plans they choose for their employees dictate coverage decisions.",
      "\"About 165 million Americans are enrolled in employer-sponsored health care plans, and 65% of them are enrolled in what's called a self-insured plan,\" United said in their statement. \"The health insurance company they select provides administrative services such as handling calls from members and paying claims. But as the phrase 'self-insured' suggests, it's the employer's funds that cover claims payments. \u2026",
      "\"Self-insured employers can design their health plans and determine what will and won't be covered for their employees,\" United continued. \"It's important to remember that your health insurer probably isn't the one that designed it that way. Your employer did.\"",
      "\"Insurance is out of control\"",
      "Dr. Elisabeth Potter, a surgeon who sees as many as 60 patients with breast cancer each week at her RedBud surgery center in Austin, Texas, said, \"The insurance companies have, honestly, made it more difficult to be healthy in the United States.\"",
      "She says insurance denials actually add to costs: \"I have two employees who spend almost all day navigating insurance. It seems that everywhere we turn, there's an issue, whether it's an insurance company saying, 'You know, we won't cover your surgery at that surgery center,' or 'We won't pay for that medication, we want you to be on a different medication.'\"",
      "Case in point: On an early morning this past Fall, Jeannie Lee, a 40-year-old mother with breast cancer, was being prepped for a procedure \u2013 a lymphovenous bypass \u2013 that could have been done two weeks earlier during her double mastectomy, but both her and her husband's insurance companies refused to cover the cost.",
      "Lee is at high risk for developing a condition known as lymphedema where, Potter said, \"It becomes very difficult to just use your arm. It can be painful. It's swollen. It's also deforming.\"",
      "Lee said, \"I'm 40 years old. I have three young kids. It's very necessary to do this procedure.\"",
      "Once Lee was able to obtain financial assistance through a new non-profit set up by Dr. Potter, she was back in surgery. \"This patient is having an extra surgery, a separate general anesthetic, because her insurance company wouldn't cover the surgery,\" Potter said. \"We could have done this very easily at the same time [as her mastectomy ].\"",
      "When she isn't in surgery, Potter is often on the phone defending her treatment decisions to insurance company medical directors who, she says, often know little about her area of medicine. \"Sometimes I get, you know, an ophthalmologist, an eye doctor. It was just completely absurd,\" she said.",
      "She sometimes posts her side of those conversations online.",
      "Potter: \"So, we're speaking about lymphedema of the arm. So, this is not an area that you're familiar with, correct?\"",
      "But a video she posted in early January 2025, she says, ended up putting her entire medical practice at risk. While she was in the operating room, Potter says she got a call from United Healthcare. That \"urgent\" call, she says, was to question why her patient needed an overnight stay in the hospital.",
      "\"It's never happened before. I didn't know what was going on, but they said it was urgent and I needed to call, and so I did,\" she said. \"I am operating. I'm doing the right thing for the patient. I'm going to keep her overnight. I walked out of the hospital and I just filmed myself in my unfiltered, you know, moment.\"",
      "Potter: \"It's out of control. Insurance is out of control.\"",
      "Shortly after she posted that video, she got a letter from the insurance company threatening to sue her for defamation. \"I'm taking great care of patients. They're just trying to scare me into being quiet,\" Potter told us.",
      "I asked, \"And weren't you scared?\"",
      "\"I was scared,\" she replied.",
      "United Healthcare has not taken Dr. Potter to court. They declined an on-camera interview, but a company spokesperson says the call was due to an erroneous order, and a doctor would never be asked to leave surgery for a call about an insurance matter.",
      "\"It was such a gut punch\"",
      "Miranda Yaver, an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh, says insurance companies know that only a small percentage of people will actually appeal claim denials.",
      "\"All of us are vulnerable to being denied,\" she said. \"Not all of us can weather the storms easily when it comes to appealing and overcoming these barriers.\"",
      "Yaver calls it \"rationing by inconvenience.\"",
      "\"A lot of people don't know that they even can appeal,\" Yaver said.",
      "I asked, \"You're saying that it's not really the denial that ends up keeping people from getting care, it's that people give up? \"",
      "\"Fewer than one percent of those in-network claim denials result in appeal, even though people were winning roughly half the time,\" Yaver said.",
      "Clearly, it does pay to appeal, but some patients, like Dr. Dan Hurley, fighting an aggressive cancer, run out of time. Much of his last months were spent, says his wife Traci, on the phone with insurance company personnel: \"He would go line by line with them and they'd say, 'Okay, yeah, we need to get a supervisor involved. We'll call you back.' And then they don't.\"",
      "Dan's goal, she says, was to see insurance companies held to a standard similar to doctors, making them liable for malpractice when they deny lifesaving care. \"The act of signing that denial is practicing medicine,\" Traci said, \"the same way, if a patient came to me and I made a decision about treatment and that decision went sideways, I'm liable. That's how it works.\"",
      "Dan Hurley died on August 3, 2023. One week later, his wife got a letter from the insurance company asking her to pay $80,000 for a round of chemotherapy that had been pre-authorized, but was suddenly retroactively denied. \"It was such a gut punch to get it that day,\" she said. \"This is unbelievable, right? Almost laughable.\"",
      "Dan Hurley's battle has become his widow's. \"There's a part of me that says, 'Oh, he would be so proud of me,' but there's also part of me that he'd be like, 'Come on, chop, chop, you got this, let's go, pick it up, don't be sad, you know, keep going.' Because that's what he was like.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",
      "On its website, the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity describes its mission as \"creating a more equitable food system that will improve health outcomes.\"",

    "summary": "After the ACA tax credit lapsed in December, enrollees are opting for less robust health plans or dropping coverage altogether.",
    "story": [
      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Mattel is introducing a Barbie with autism as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity.",
    "story": [
      "Mattel Inc. is introducing a Barbie with autism Monday as the newest member of its line intended to celebrate diversity, joining a collection that already includes Barbies with Down syndrome, a blind Barbie, a Barbie and a Ken with vitiligo, and other models the toymaker added to make its fashion dolls more inclusive.",
      "Mattel said it developed the doll over more than 18 months in partnership with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, a nonprofit organization that advocates for the rights and better media representation of people with autism. The goal: to create a Barbie that reflected some of the ways people with autism may experience and process the world around them, according to a Mattel news release.",
      "That was a challenge because autism encompasses a broad range of behaviors and difficulties that vary widely in degree, and many of the traits associated with the disorder are not immediately visible, according to Noor Pervez, who is the Autistic Self Advocacy Network's community engagement manager and worked closely with Mattel on the Barbie prototype.",
      "Like many disabilities, \"autism doesn't look any one way,\" Pervez said. \"But we can try and show some of the ways that autism expresses itself.\"",
      "For example, the eyes of the new Barbie shift slightly to the side to represent how some people with autism sometimes avoid direct eye contact, he said. The doll also was given articulated elbows and wrists to acknowledge stimming, hand flapping and other gestures that some people with autism use to process sensory information or to express excitement, according to Mattel.",
      "The development team debated whether to dress the doll in a tight or a loose-fitting outfit, Pervez said. Some people with autism wear loose clothes because they are sensitive to the feel of fabric seams, while others wear figure-hugging garments to give them a sense of where their bodies are, he said.",
      "The team ended up choosing an A-line dress with short sleeves and a flowy skirt that provides less fabric-to-skin contact. The doll also wears flat shoes to promote stability and ease of movement, according to Mattel.",
      "Each doll comes with a pink finger clip fidget spinner, noise-canceling headphones and a pink tablet modeled after the devices some people with autism who struggle to speak use to communicate.",
      "The addition of the doll with autism to the Barbie Fashionistas line also became an occasion for Mattel to create a doll with facial features inspired by the company's employees in India and mood boards reflecting a range of women with Indian backgrounds. Pervez said it was important to have the doll represent a segment of the community of people with autism that is generally underrepresented.",
      "Mattel introduced its first doll with Down syndrome in 2023 and brought out a Barbie representing a person with Type 1 diabetes last summer. The Fashionistas also include a Barbie and a Ken with a prosthetic leg, and a Barbie with hearing aids, but the line also encompasses tall, petite and curvy body types and numerous hair types and skin colors.",
      "\"Barbie has always strived to reflect the world kids see and the possibilities they imagine, and we're proud to introduce our first autistic Barbie as part of that ongoing work,\" Jamie Cygielman, Mattel's global head of dolls, said in a statement.",
      "The doll was expected to be available at Mattel's online shop and at Target stores starting Monday for a suggested retail price of $11.87. Walmart stores are expected to start carrying the new Barbie in March, Mattel said.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last year that the estimated prevalence of autism among 8-year-old children in the U.S. was 1 in 31. The estimate from the CDC's Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network said Black, Hispanic, Asian and Pacific Islander children in the U.S. were more likely than white children to have a diagnosis, with the prevalence more than three times higher among boys than girls.",

    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. for comment.",
      "Supporters point to trillions in credit card debt",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, the highest level on record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in 2023 that credit card rates have soared \"far above the cost of offering credit.\"",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "Opponents argue a credit card rate cap could backfire",
      "Opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "A coalition of groups that represent banks \u2014 including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute \u2014 argued in a statement to CBS News on Friday that a 10% interest rate cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.\"",
      "The Bank Policy Institute estimated last year that more than 14 million American households that rarely pay their credit card balances in full could have their access to credit eliminated or curtailed by a 10% cap. Millions of people who sometimes pay off their balances could also face new restrictions, the group said.",
      "The American Bankers Association has\u00a0argued in the past that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people who are in need of loans would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" that often charge even higher rates, like payday lenders and pawn shops.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "Ackman later wrote: \"Finding a way to bring down credit card rates without taking credit away from many Americans would have a very positive impact on the most disadvantaged Americans.\"",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "Trump pledges to deal with affordability",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 23:13:13 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump has said Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and sold American oil.\" But the history between the countries is far more complicated, experts note.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump announced the capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife on Saturday, he justified the military operation in part by framing it as a move to recover assets that he claims had been stolen from U.S. companies.",
      "\"Venezuela unilaterally seized and sold American oil, American assets and American platforms, costing us billions and billions of dollars,\" Mr. Trump said. \"This constituted one of the largest thefts of American property in the history of our country.\"",
      "Who owns Venezuela's oil?",
      "The president's focus on Venezuela's oil is now raising questions about American energy companies' activities in the country, as well as whether U.S. oil giants might now work to revive its floundering petroleum industry. Venezuela's\u00a0constitution\u00a0states that the nation owns all mineral and hydrocarbon deposits \u2014 its oil and natural gas reserves \u2014 within its own territory, including those that lie beneath the country's seabed.",
      "Mr. Trump \"talks about them taking our oil \u2014 the oil itself was never 'our oil',\" Samantha Gross, director of the energy security and climate initiative at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, told CBS News, adding that the nation's vast crude reserves \"belong to the government of Venezuela.\"",
      "What's also true, however, is that U.S. oil companies had contractual agreements with Venezuela to extract, process and transport its oil, as well as to share in the revenue from oil sales.",
      "Mr. Trump's claims of theft reflect actions by then-Venezuela leader Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to nationalize the nation's energy sector in 2007 and to confiscate the production assets of Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips after they left the country, Gross said.",
      "Those seizures have led to years of lawsuits and efforts by the companies to recoup their losses. While a World Bank arbitration panel has ruled in favor of the oil companies, the money has yet to be recovered.",
      "\"It is beyond question that there are a number of U.S. companies and others out there who have claims against Venezuela that have been trying to get those claims satisfied for many years,\" Ted Posner, a partner at law firm Baker Botts and a former assistant general counsel for international affairs at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told CBS News.",
      "The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Oil industry executives met on Friday afternoon at the White House with Mr. Trump, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum and Energy Secretary Chris Wright to discuss Venezuela. Representatives from Exxon, Chevron and ConocoPhillips attended, including ConocoPhillips CEO Ryan Lance.",
      "\"ConocoPhillips continues to monitor developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,\" the company said in a statement prior to the meeting.",
      "Said a Chevron spokesperson after the meeting on Friday: \"For more than a century, Chevron has been a part of Venezuela's past. We remain committed to its present. And we stand ready to help it build a better future while strengthening U.S. energy and regional security.\"",
      "Exxon didn't respond to requests for comment.",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's power play \u2014 and corruption",
      "Venezuela's government has a long history of nationalizing its oil sector, with state oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., or PDVSA, taking over the industry in the 1970s. Exxon and other foreign oil companies continued to operate in the country by signing contracts to provide technical assistance and other expertise to PDVSA.",
      "In the 1990s, Exxon and other large petroleum companies were invited by then-Venezuelan President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez to return in an effort to develop the oil reserves in the Orinoco River Basin, according to \"Energy in the Americas,\" a book published by the University of Calgary Press.",
      "But in 2003, Ch\u00e1vez fired thousands of PDVSA workers after they went on strike. Four years later, he expanded the nationalization push by requiring foreign companies to give majority ownership of their ventures to PDVSA. Exxon and ConocoPhillips failed to strike a deal with Venezuela, while BP, Houston-based Chevron, Norway's Statoil and France's Total signed pacts giving majority stakes to PDVSA, allowing them to remain, Reuters reported in 2007.",
      "\"Some agreed, and some did not, and assets were expropriated,\" Gross said.",
      "Amid widespread corruption under Ch\u00e1vez, as journalist Anne Appelbaum noted in a 2024 book, hundreds of billions of dollars were siphoned off from PDVSA and other Venezuelan companies and subsequently disappeared into private bank accounts around the world.",
      "A 2017 investigation by U.S. and Portuguese authorities found that PDVSA executives had funneled millions of dollars into Portugal's Banco Espirito Santo.",
      "Venezuela owes billions to Big Oil",
      "Ch\u00e1vez's strong-arm tactics led to efforts by Exxon and ConocoPhillips to seek compensation for their assets, with Exxon claiming it had lost $16.6 billion due to the nationalization campaign. A World Bank arbitration panel in 2014 awarded the company one-tenth of what it had sought, but that same body later\u00a0annulled most of that award.",
      "In a separate case, an international tribunal\u00a0ruled that Venezuela owed $8.7 billion to ConocoPhillips in compensation for the 2007 seizure of its assets.",
      "Other industries also had their assets taken away under Ch\u00e1vez's 14-year reign, and companies have filed at least 60 arbitration claims against Venezuela since the 2000s, according to Luisa Palacios, an adjunct senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy.",
      "\"The value of these liabilities is estimated at $20 to $30 billion or about 10% to 15% of the almost $200 billion in international debt obligations Venezuela owes,\" she said in an article this week published by Columbia.",
      "\"Venezuela could pay off these claims by inviting investors back to the country,\" she noted. \"That could be done through debt-for-equity swaps or by linking future oil production to repayment of current debts. However, restructuring the country's foreign obligations will likely be needed for Venezuela to fully realize its oil potential.\"",
      "U.S. wasting no time",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves\u00a0are estimated to be the world's largest, with more than 303 billion barrels. That represents about 17% of the world's total oil supply, according to OPEC\u00a0data.",
      "But Venezuela's crude oil production has plunged, with the industry today pumping 800,000 to 1 million barrels per day, down from more than 3 million per day in the early 2000s. That output has nosedived due to chronic underinvestment, government mismanagement, and the impact of U.S. and international sanctions.",
      "On Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the U.S. will export between 30 million and 50 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, which will be sold at \"market rates,\" with revenue used \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Venezuela's interim government had agreed to release the oil.",
      "Although Mr. Trump is pushing U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela following Maduro's capture, they may need assurances before committing to new ventures, Gross said.",

The strategy will rely on major investment from American energy companies to revitalize Venezuela's dilapidated oil infrastructure.

      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032.

The U.S. labor market lost 173,000 jobs in October, a larger decline than the earlier reported decline of 105,000 jobs, while November hiring was revised down to 56,000 from 64,000.",
      "\"The labor market has shown continued resiliency, but it's still softening, and the pace of year-to-date overall employment gains has slowed to the dragging pace of growth we saw in 2020,\" said Jerry Tempelman, vice president of fixed income research at Mutual of America Capital Management, in a Friday email.",

      "Job growth slowed throughout 2025 as some businesses grappled with economic uncertainty, prompting them to pull back on hiring. Employers added a total of roughly 584,000 jobs in 2025, down sharply from more than 2 million the previous year and the weakest annual gain outside a recession since 2003, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Some big corporations, such as Amazon, cut jobs as they sought to rely more on artificial intelligence, while the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency oversaw the reduction of roughly 300,000 government jobs last year, Challenger, Gray & Christmas said.",
      "The headwinds facing the labor market prompted the Federal Reserve to thrice cut its benchmark interest rate late last year, as lowering borrowing costs can help spur hiring by making it cheaper for businesses to expand.",
      "Prior to the release of Friday's report, EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said he is forecasting hiring will average 25,000 new jobs per month for the first half of 2026, while the unemployment rate could drift up to 4.8%.",

      "While hiring was weak in 2025, experts don't think the labor market is collapsing.",
      "\"There aren't any red flashing lights indicating an imminent recession, but there are plenty of yellow warning lights flashing, and there is the risk that we could approach stall speed,\" said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, in a Friday research note.",
      "Payroll gains averaged about 50,000 per month last year, according to BLS\u00a0data, which is the amount the economy requires to maintain a stable labor market, according to Jamie Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group, which aligns with the December job gains and the average payroll gains throughout 2025.",
      "Interest rate outlook",
      "Signs of stabilization in the labor market \u2014 particularly a lower jobless rate \u2014 could lead the Federal Reserve to hit the brakes on interest rate cuts for now, according to some experts.",
      "\"For this report, all roads lead to the unemployment rate,\" said Olu Sonola, head of U.S. Economic Research at Fitch Ratings, in an email. \"At 4.4%, it simply reads as relief versus 4.6% and it should douse the Fed's recent urgency to backstop a weakening labor market.\"",
      "The Federal Reserve is tasked with maintaining strong hiring while also taming inflation. A weaker labor market picture in 2025 compelled the central bank to cut interest rates three times.",
      "The upshot for 2026, experts say, is that rate cuts are coming, but they may arrive later in the year.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",

    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines said that it will no longer carry out migrant deportation flights for the Department of Homeland Security, ending a contract that supported the U.S. government's immigration enforcement efforts.",
      "The Houston-based carrier, founded in 2021, said its deal to handle Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation flights did not sufficiently boost the airline's financial position. As a result, the low-cost carrier is shutting down its hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where its migrant flight operation was based, the company said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"Avelo will close the base at [Mesa Gateway Airport] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,\" an Avelo spokesperson said. \"The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.\"",
      "Avelo operates low-cost flights to dozens of destinations, including the Caribbean, from four U.S. hubs. It is planning to open a fifth base in Dallas in late 2026.",
      "DHS has long partnered with CSI Aviation, which subcontracted with Avelo to provide ICE with air charter services. The federal agency also subcontracts with other charter companies, including GlobalX, which handled more than half of DHS' charter flights in 2025, according to ICE Flight Monitor at Human Rights First, a group that tracks ICE deportation flights.",
      "\"ICE never contracted directly with Avelo Airlines,\" DHS said in a statement to CBS News. \"ICE will continue to utilize its contracted service provider, which works with multiple airlines to support the American people's mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.\"",
      "In April, Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy expressed confidence that the airline's deportation business would help drive the carrier's growth, while conceding that handling deportation flights was a \"sensitive and complicated topic.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump says he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he said would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on social media Thursday that he is directing the federal government to buy $200 billion in mortgage bonds, a move he argued would help reduce mortgage rates at a time when Americans are worried about home prices.",
      "Mr. Trump and the White House have been trying to show they are responding to voter concerns about affordability ahead of midterm elections in November. Home prices have generally risen faster than incomes because of a persistent construction shortfall, making it harder for renters to buy their first home and for existing owners to upgrade to a new property \u2014 a challenge that dates back to Mr. Trump's first term and the recovery from the housing market collapse that triggered the global financial crisis in 2008.",
      "Mr. Trump last month said he planned to unveil housing reforms \u2014 and on Wednesday, he announced that he\u00a0wants to block institutional investors from buying houses.",
      "The president said Thursday that the two mortgage giants under government conservatorship, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have $200 billion in cash that will be used to make the mortgage bond purchases.",
      "\"This will drive Mortgage Rates DOWN, monthly payments DOWN, and make the cost of owning a home more affordable,\" he posted on Truth Social.",
      "Federal Housing Finance Authority Director Bill Pulte, who oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, said on X the two government-run companies \"will be executing\" the president's request.",
      "The Federal Reserve has, in the past, bought mortgage bonds during times of economic turmoil in order to help reduce interest rates, leading many homeowners to refinance into rates of 3% or less. The low rates of the recent past make these homeowners reluctant to sell their properties, depriving the market of inventory.",
      "Additional mortgage purchases by Fannie Mae and Freddie could temporarily help lower mortgage costs, but that approach also could have unintended consequences, according to TD Securities analysts.",
      "\"We see this succeeding in the short term, though we believe it will reignite home prices' inflation given supply constraints,\" they said in a research note, alluding to a severe shortage of affordable housing in the U.S.",
      "Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at the real estate brokerage Redfin, estimated to the Associated Press that the government purchases of mortgage debt could shave 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points off the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. But she also cautioned that the purchases wouldn't address other factors driving high housing costs, like limited supply.",
      "More than 75% of homes across the\u00a0U.S. are unaffordable\u00a0for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site. Property data firm ATTOM found Thursday that in the last three months of 2025, median-priced single-family homes were less affordable than historical averages in 99% of the nearly 600 U.S. counties the company analyzed.",
      "Mortgage rates have been averaging around 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, which went into federal conservatorship along with Fannie Mae in 2008 when the U.S. economy crashed during the Great Recession. Thirty-year mortgage rates haven't been below 6% since September 2022.",
      "Mortgage rates began to climb as inflation spiked coming out of the global pandemic, with the consumer price index hitting a four-decade high in 2022. The average mortgage rate is down from nearly 7% at the start of Mr. Trump's second term last year, yet the decrease has done little to reassure a public that feels pressure from the costs of housing, food and energy.",
      "When interest rates fall it can become cheaper to service housing debt on a monthly basis. The reduced monthly payments can improve affordability for a period until home prices adjust in response to changes in the rates. There was roughly $21.1 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt as of the middle of last year, according to the St. Louis Federal Reserve.",
      "Many homeowners took advantage of low interest rates during the pandemic to refinance their mortgages at rates of 3% or lower.",
      "The plan to buy up hundreds of billions in mortgage bonds could also carry some risk for Fannie and Freddie because Mr. Trump would be spending the cash reserves that are supposed to help be a buffer against an economic downturn akin to what happened during the Great Recession. In a sense, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae could be more vulnerable if anything negative happens to the housing market, meaning Mr. Trump is betting that possibility is highly unlikely.",
      "Fannie and Freddie work by buying up scores of residential mortgages and repackaging them as mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors. Collectively, they guarantee trillions of dollars' worth of mortgages.",
      "In the past, the president has pushed to take Fannie and Freddie public. Supporters argue that move could generate hundreds of billions of dollars for the federal government, but critics warn it may push up mortgage rates by raising uncertainty about the two megafirms.",
      "But on Thursday, Mr. Trump appeared to rethink that plan, writing: \"Because I chose not to sell Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in my First Term, a truly great decision, and against the advice of the 'experts,' it is now worth many times that amount \u2014 AN ABSOLUTE FORTUNE \u2014 and has $200 BILLION DOLLARS IN CASH.\"",

Discovery turned down the latest offer as well, stating that Paramount Skydance's bid posed \"significant costs, risks and uncertainties\" compared with the Netflix merger. Warner Bros. Discovery also said Paramount Skydance's offer would burden the combined company with significant debt.",

Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",

Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",

    "summary": "Taxpayers can start filing their 2025 tax returns on Jan. 26, 2026, the IRS says.",
    "story": [
      "Taxpayers eager to receive their tax refunds should mark Jan. 26, 2026, on their calendars, as the IRS said Thursday it will begin accepting federal income tax filings on that date.",
      "Annual tax refunds are typically the largest checks that households receive each year, with last year's average payment amounting to almost $3,200, according to IRS data. This year's refund season could be even larger, with the typical check set to increase by an additional $1,000, financial services company Piper Sandler said in a recent analysis.",
      "2025 tax returns will be impacted by a number of major changes signed into law through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" act, which enacted a host of new tax breaks retroactive to 2025. These include eliminating taxes on some overtime and tipped income, as well as lifting the cap on the deduction for state and local taxes, or SALT, from $10,000 to $40,000.",
      "Federal income tax returns are due April 15, although people who need more time can file for an\u00a0automatic tax extension before that. An extension gives taxpayers until Oct. 15 to file, although any taxes owed must still be paid by April 15 to avoid penalties.",
      "When will you get your refund?",
      "The question on most taxpayers' minds is how long it will take for their refund to be deposited.",
      "That depends on whether a taxpayer files electronically or submits a paper return, as well as whether the IRS identifies any problems with a filing.",
      "People who file electronically typically receive their refunds in less than 21 days. That means a taxpayer who files a Form 1040 on Jan. 26 could receive a refund by Feb. 16, assuming there are no issues with the return.",
      "Filers can use the IRS' \"Where's My Refund\" tool to check the status of their return, with the agency typically providing information about 24 hours after an electronic filing.",
      "The IRS said on Thursday that \"Where's My Refund\" will require four weeks to provide information for paper tax returns. Paper tax forms typically take longer for the IRS to process because they require manual handling, unlike e-filed returns.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. trade deficit dropped sharply in October, reaching its lowest level since 2009 as imports dropped under President Trump's sweeping tariffs, according to new government data.",
      "The overall trade gap plunged 39% to $29.4 billion in October, as imports fell by 3.2%, Department of Commerce figures show. The deficit was significantly lower than the $58.4 billion median forecast from surveys of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal.",
      "While U.S. exports rose by $7.8 billion in October to $302 billion, imports dropped by $11 billion to $331.4 billion. The U.S. trade deficit in September was $48.1 billion.",
      "\"Swings in trade of gold and pharmaceuticals were behind the plunge in the trade deficit to a two-decade low in October, though higher computer imports suggest there are genuine signs of strength elsewhere in the economy amid the AI buildout,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "The release of the trade data was delayed by more than a month due to a 43-day\u00a0government shutdown last year, depriving officials and companies of updated figures as they assess the health of the world's biggest economy.",
      "The figures underscore how Mr. Trump's volatile and sweeping tariff policies have influenced trade flows. When the president unveiled wide-ranging tariffs on imports from dozens of trading partners, U.S. businesses rushed to stock up on inventory, front-loading imports ahead of planned tariff hikes.",
      "This has allowed many firms to avoid passing on the full cost of tariffs to consumers, keeping price hikes on goods relatively tame.",
      "As U.S. households grapple with an affordability crisis, Mr. Trump has more recently expanded the range of\u00a0goods exempt from tariffs, including key agricultural imports.",
      "As of mid-November, the Budget Lab at Yale University estimated that consumers face an overall average effective tariff rate topping 16%, the highest since the 1930s.",
      "Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, could still be struck down if the Supreme Court rules that Mr. Trump illegally invoked the law to enact tariffs. A ruling is expected as early as Friday.",

    "summary": "President Trump said \"people live in homes, not corporations,\" in announcing plans to bar big investors from home purchases.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said on Wednesday that he will take steps to prevent institutional investors from buying single-family homes, claiming the move would help make housing more affordable for Americans.",
      "In a social media\u00a0post, Mr. Trump said that the dream of home ownership has become increasingly out of reach for many Americans, and that action is needed to allow more people to reach the milestone of owning a residence.",
      "\"I am immediately taking steps to ban large institutional investors from buying more single-family homes, and I will be calling on Congress to codify it,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"People live in homes, not corporations.\"",
      "He added that he will provide more details about the proposal at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month.",
      "The White House declined to provide more information on Mr. Trump's plans for restricting large investors from acquiring homes.",
      "Shares of major home leasing and management companies fell sharply immediately after Mr. Trump's announcement. Invitation Homes' stock price slid more than 7%, while American Homes 4 Rent dropped 6.3%. Investment giant Blackstone, which also owns and rents homes, sank more than 4%.",
      "\"It is an idea that appeals to MAGA populists and is a policy that Vice President J.D. Vance has consistently supported,\" Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Cowen, said in a research note. \"That it comes now is an indicator of how worried Team Trump is worried about the impact of housing affordability on the midterm election.\"",
      "Seiberg expects both the House and Senate to pass bipartisan bills to implement Mr. Trump's order. \"We appreciate that many important congressional Republicans have opposed this in the past. Our view is that they will concede on this issue rather than fight the president,\" he added.",
      "Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "The analysis also noted that institutional ownership varies nationwide, reaching 4.2% in Atlanta, 2.6% in Dallas and 2.2% in Houston. But these investors tend not to dominate neighborhoods, even if they're generally more concentrated in lower- and middle-income communities.",
      "Impact on home prices and rent",
      "Still, the recent rise of institutional investors purchasing single-family homes can have negative spillover effects for consumers, research shows.",
      "In 2024, the Government Accountability Office\u00a0found that institutional investment can increase rents and home prices, particularly in geographies with high concentrations of investor-owned properties.",
      "Advocates for policies benefiting property owners said they would support policies that block large investors from scooping up properties.",
      "\"We are very glad to see that the administration is squarely focusing on housing and housing affordability,\" Colin Allen, executive director of the American Property Owners Alliance,\u00a0 a nonpartisan advocacy group, told CBS News. \"Each home that is taken off the market by an institutional investor is one less for an owner-occupant to try to move into at a time when there is a lot of competition for homes for sale.\"",
      "More than 75% of homes across the U.S. are unaffordable for most Americans, according to Bankrate, a personal finance site.",
      "Data from the National Association of Realtors show that only 24% of home purchases in 2024 were made by first-time homebuyers, down from 50% in 2010. Housing economists also point to a severe shortage of inventory for the soaring cost of homes in recent years.",
      "Goldman Sachs analysts in October estimated the U.S. would need to add 3 million to 4 million homes above the normal pace of construction levels to help ease residential real estate prices.",
      "A better solution?",
      "Some experts are skeptical that Mr. Trump's proposal to restrict investor ownership of single-family homes would help ease housing costs for Americans.",
      "Institutional investors contribute to the housing supply by buying and renovating derelict homes, and then putting them back on the market, said Edward Pinto, senior fellow and co-director of the AEI Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "A ban on real estate trusts, private equity firms and other housing market investors from buying homes could also have unintended consequences by discouraging such players from selling their existing properties, he added.",
      "A better way to create affordable housing, Pinto said, is to make more efficient use of the nation's existing housing stock by allowing homeowners to rent out unused rooms tax-free, and also by incentivizing states to build more homes.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon customers can now file a claim under its $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which resolved allegations of deceptive enrollment practices in the retailer's Prime shopping service.",
      "As part of the September 2025 settlement, Amazon is offering $1.5 billion in refunds to eligible customers, as well as paying a $1 billion civil penalty. The FTC had alleged that Amazon duped customers into signing up for Prime and made it hard for customers to cancel their membership.",
      "Amazon neither admitted nor denied the allegations as part of the settlement. Here's what to know.",
      "How do you file a claim in the Amazon Prime FTC settlement?",
      "Amazon customers should go to the settlement website to file their claim. Although millions of eligible customers will receive automatic payments through the settlement without filing a claim, some will need to submit one, the site notes.",

      "People who qualify can receive a refund of their Amazon Prime membership fees, up to $51, according to the settlement site.",

    "published": "Wed, 07 Jan 2026 07:04:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
    "story": [
      "The Alaska Airlines pilot who has been universally praised as a hero for safely landing a jet after a door plug panel flew off shortly after takeoff is suing Boeing because he believes the plane maker wrongly tried to blame him and the rest of the crew.",
      "Captain Brandon Fisher was commended by the heads of the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration and even Boeing executives for helping ensure none of the 177 people aboard flight 1282 were killed when the blowout happened in January 2024.",
      "But Fisher's lawyers say Boeing's attempts to deflect liability in past lawsuits despite what the NTSB investigation found led to the pilot being sued by some passengers and caused him great distress. Still, experts say it's unusual for a pilot to sue like this in an incident where he wasn't seriously hurt or killed. Four flight attendants previously sued Boeing over the incident last summer.",
      "Fisher's lawsuit says Boeing suggested it wasn't responsible because the plane was \"improperly maintained or misused\" by others.",
      "\"It was clear Boeing's words were directed at Captain Fisher in attempt to paint him as the scapegoat for Boeing's numerous failures,\" Fisher's lawyers, William Walsh and Richard Mummolo, wrote in the lawsuit filed in an Oregon court.",
      "Key bolts were missing",
      "The NTSB investigation of the blowout found that four bolts securing what is known as the door plug panel were removed and never replaced during a repair as the Boeing 737 Max 9 aircraft was being assembled. Boeing and key supplier Spirit Aerosystems, which has since been acquired by Boeing, were both implicated.",
      "The bolts are hidden behind interior panels in the plane, so they are not something that could have been easily checked in a preflight inspection by the pilot or anyone else from the airline. NTSB investigators determined the door plug was gradually moving upward over the 154 flights prior to the incident before it ultimately flew off.",
      "\"Boeing's lie infuriated Captain Fisher as well, as he was being castigated for his actions as opposed to being lauded,\" Fisher's lawyers wrote. \"Because he had flown Boeing aircraft for the entirety of his employment with Alaska Airlines, Boeing's attempts to blame him felt like a deep, personal betrayal by a company that claimed to hold pilots in the highest regard.\"",
      "The NTSB made clear this was caused by a manufacturing issue and the crew's actions were exemplary. Experienced pilot John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems aviation safety consulting firm, said the crew did a remarkable job considering what they were dealing with, and no one has faulted the crew.",
      "\"I think the Boeing lawyers were kind of grasping at straws,\" Cox said.",
      "Terrifying moments",
      "The blowout occurred minutes after the flight took off from Portland, Oregon, and created a roaring air vacuum. Seven passengers and one flight attendant sustained minor injuries, but the plane landed safely.",
      "\"The first indication was an explosion in my ears and then a whoosh of air,\" First Officer Emily Wiprud told CBS News in an exclusive interview in 2024. \"My body was forced forward and there was a loud bang as well. ... The flight deck door was open. I saw tubes hanging from the cabin.\"",

    "story": [
      "Airlines are serving \"potentially unhealthy water\" to passengers, according to a new study, with researchers recommending that travelers stick to bottled water and avoid drinking coffee or tea served on aircraft.",
      "The nonprofit Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity, which examined more than 35,000 water samples served by 10 major and 11 regional airlines over three years, also urges passengers to avoid washing their hands in aircraft bathrooms and instead stick to using hand sanitizer containing at least 60% alcohol.",
      "Among major U.S. airlines, three \u2014 American Airlines, JetBlue and Spirit \u2014 earned a \"D\" rating from the group, according to the analysis. Delta and Frontier were the top-ranked major carriers, both earning \"A\" grades for their water.",
      "Water quality may not be a top-of-mind airline safety issue with passengers, but it's nevertheless an \"important public health consideration,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity noted in its analysis. Drinking potentially contaminated aircraft water can result in issues such as gastrointestinal illness and exposure to pathogens, the group added.",
      "What the study found",
      "The analysis found that 2.7% of samples tested positive for total coliform, a group of bacteria that's found in the digestive tracts of humans and animals, as well as in plants and soil.",
      "\"Testing for coliform bacteria is important because their presence in drinking water indicates that disease-causing organisms (pathogens) could be in the water system,\" the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity said in its report.",
      "E. coli was identified 32 times across the 21 airlines, the group said.",
      "The Environmental Protection Agency established the Aircraft Drinking Water Rule, or ADWR, in 2011, which applies to U.S. carriers with onboard drinking water systems for passengers and crew. The rule requires airlines to test for coliform bacteria and possible E. coli, as well as to disinfect and flush each aircraft's water tank four times a year.",
      "But the EPA rarely levies civil penalties to airlines that violate the ADWR, the study noted.",
      "Airlines respond",
      "American Airlines told CBS News it is \"closely reviewing\" the findings.",
      "\"American's potable water program is fully in compliance with the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Aircraft Drinking Water Rule (ADWR),\" the carrier told CBS News. \"A recent EPA audit showed there were no significant findings with our program, and we have not received any violations for any potable water cabinets or trucks that we use.\"",
      "JetBlue said in a statement that it follows processes outlined by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure safe water. The airline added that it serves bottled drinking water on its flights.",
      "Spirit also said it maintains a comprehensive testing and maintenance program that complies with the EPA's aircraft drinking water rule.",
      "\"The well-being and comfort of our guests is very important to us,\" the company told CBS News in a statement. \"Our data shows we have made progress in this area in recent years, and we continue to evaluate and refine our procedures as necessary.\"",
      "Southwest Airlines, which received a \"C\" grade, said it regularly inspects the water quality aboard its planes and that it complies with EPA standards. The company also said it only uses water from local municipal public water systems that already meet standards for residents and businesses.",
      "On its website, the Center for Food as Medicine & Longevity describes its mission as \"creating a more equitable food system that will improve health outcomes.\"",

    "summary": "A prediction market user won big after wagering $32,000 that the U.S. would capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Was it insider trading?",
    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",
      "\"It's about fundamental fairness,\" Piepgrass said. \"Do you want to be placing bets in an area where some people have information directly relevant to winning that bet, but you do not? If you are a consumer, you have to really question, is that a market you want to participate in.\"",

    "summary": "Travel insurance won't help most people whose flights were disrupted by the turmoil in Venezuela. Here's what such policies do cover.",
    "story": [
      "Thousands of people were stranded abroad because their flights home were scrapped after the U.S. temporarily shut down airspace around Venezuela following the capture of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Some travellers remain stuck because airlines rebooked them on flights that don't leave for days, while others face thousands of dollars in extra travel-related expenses, such as lodging costs. Now, industry experts are advising them to ask airlines for refunds and, for those with travel insurance, to file a claim.",
      "On Saturday, the day of the attack, roughly 1,130 flights within, into or out of the U.S., were cancelled, hundreds of which were scheduled to depart from Aruba, Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and other Caribbean islands, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Airlines have since resumed service in the region after the flight restrictions were lifted.",
      "What travel insurance doesn't cover",
      "If you're already on a trip, of course, it's too late to purchase travel insurance.",
      "\"It's like buying car insurance after you hit a tree,\" Suzanne Morrow, CEO of InsureMyTrip, a travel insurance comparison site, told CBS News.",
      "Even if you have coverage, meanwhile, there are limitations. Most travel policies include exclusions that might apply to trip interruptions of the sort that led to the now-lifted restrictions on Caribbean airspace. That can make it hard for purchasers of travel insurance to know if a policy will protect them.",
      "\"Coverage decisions are based on policy language and official determinations. My recommendation is to save all of your receipts for every expense incurred,\" Morrow said.",
      "Specifically, most policies expressly exclude coverage when a policyholder's trip is disrupted due to an act of war, terrorism, or civil unrest, she noted. Such determinations are based on airlines' stated reasons for cancelling flights.",
      "As a result, payouts for delayed trips might not\u00a0apply to the Venezuela flight restrictions, Jeff Rolander, vice president of claims and customer experience at Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News.",
      "\"Insurers have been assessing the situation to determine if coverage will apply, and acts of war are a general exclusion under all travel insurance policies,\" he said.",
      "What travel insurance does cover",
      "People who bought travel insurance are generally entitled to compensation when an airline cancels a flight because of a mechanical issue or other problem within the carrier's control.",
      "\"Standard travel insurance policies are designed to protect against baggage loss or flight delays due to an airline issue,\" said Chrissy Valdez, senior director of operations at Square Mouth, a travel insurance comparison site.",
      "The policies can also protect travellers if they need to cancel trips for personal emergencies, such as illness or injury.",
      "Many travel insurance providers also offer add-ons that provide coverage for trips that are interrupted for \"any reason,\" but such an upgrade has to be purchased in advance.",
      "Valdez said some fliers could be eligible for compensation for a cancelled flight if the rebooked flight is cancelled due to an airline issue.",
      "\"Sometimes, because of airspace closures, airlines are trying to catch up and there may not be aircraft available. Mechanical issues could prevent them from adding additional aircraft to the fleet, and those kinds of things could still be covered,\" she said.",
      "The average cost of travel insurance is around $21 a day, according to Square Mouth. A policy's pricing is based on trip costs and the breadth of coverage.",
      "Always file a claim",
      "For travellers whose flights are cancelled, Morrow said the first course of action beyond saving receipts should be to file a claim with their airline for any added expenses. Those costs could include meals, lodging and other costs incurred as a result of a flight cancellation.",
      "\"Go through the process, whether or not they cover anything. At least make the effort to get compensation, particularly if you don't have insurance,\" she advised.",
      "If you do have travel coverage, your provider can also help with rebooking flights and finding alternate accommodations in the interim.",
      "\"Travel insurance does so much more than reimburse for expenses. It also comes with assistance benefits that can help when trips are interrupted,\" Morrow said.",

      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",

      "It remains uncertain whether U.S. firms will reinvest in Venezuela right away. Experts say it would take companies years to build out their operations in Venezuela, and many oil companies could tread lightly because of political uncertainty.",

American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"",

      "Despite repeated attempts to raise the federal minimum wage, the national baseline hourly rate has remained at $7.25 since 2009. In the meantime, many states and municipalities have boosted their wage floors through a patchwork of ballot measures and legislation. These changes are often framed as a way to combat inflation, which has cooled since 2022 but remains a pain point for many Americans.",

      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",

      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department Friday stemming from a criminal investigation into its chair, Jerome Powell, he said in a video statement Sunday.",
      "The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025, according to Powell.",
      "\"That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" Powell said.",
      "The project and Powell's testimony came under scrutiny by the Trump administration last year, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "In his testimony to the Senate, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens, disputing claims made by Vought.",
      "\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one \u2014 certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is above the law,\" Powell said Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,\" Powell said.",
      "Video message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell: https://t.co/5dfrkByGyX pic.twitter.com/O4ecNaYaGH",
      "In a statement, a Department of Justice spokesperson said Attorney General Pam Bondi \"has instructed her U.S. Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars,\" but did not refer to any specific case.",
      "President Trump told NBC News Sunday night he didn't know about the Powell probe. \"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he remarked.",
      "Bloomberg reported\u00a0on Monday that Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte was the instigator behind the Powell subpeona. Pulte said Monday that the Justice Department is \"out of my purview,\" and he didn't \"know anything about it.\" The\u00a0Government Accountability Office is investigating Pulte for his actions\u00a0at the helm of FHFA, which the GAO said in December includes \"referrals of New York Attorney General Letitia James, U.S. Senator Adam Schiff, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and Congressman Eric Swalwell to the U.S. Department of Justice for mortgage fraud.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council chief Kevin Hassett, rumored to be one of Mr. Trump's top choices to replace Powell when his term is up at the Fed this year, said Monday morning that he \"respects the independence of the Justice Department and the Fed.\"",
      "Asked if he was worried about volatility in the markets due to the Fed tumult, Hassett said: \"I would expect that the markets would be happy to see that there's more transparency at the Fed.\"",
      "Bipartisan criticism",
      "Senators from both sides of the aisle blasted the investigation.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, said in a statement that, \"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question. I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed\u2014including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy\u2014until this legal matter is fully resolved.\"",
      "Tillis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, which will hold confirmation hearings and vote on the president's pick to replace Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve. The committee has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so his opposition could prevent the committee from advancing the nomination for a full Senate vote.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the probe \"an assault on the Fed's independence.\"",
      "\"This is the kind of bullying that we've all come to expect from Donald Trump and his cronies. Anyone who is independent and doesn't just fall in line behind Trump gets investigated,\" Schumer said on social media.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, said in a statement that the president \"is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends. This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.\"",
      "And Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat form Virginia who also sits on the Banking Committee, issued a statement saying, \"The Fed was designed to operate independently, insulated from political pressure, so that it can make tough decisions based on data and the long-term health of the economy, not the whims of any one president. ... Uncertainty and instability can ripple through the economy, affecting borrowing costs and making it harder for families to buy a home, run a small business, or afford everyday necessities like food, fuel, and diapers.\"",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump\u00a0during his first term, replacing Janet Yellen, an appointment of President Barack Obama, and the Senate\u00a0confirmed Powll\u00a0in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "For months last year, Mr. Trump expressed his unhappiness with the Fed's decision to leave interest rates stable. The president\u00a0argued\u00a0that inflation was already low enough to start cutting rates. It wasn't until late 2025 that the Fed started cutting rates.",
      "The president has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell, including as recently as last month.",
      "Closing out his statement Sunday, Powell said, \"I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. ... I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\"",

      "Rep. Ilhan Omar said Sunday that it is \"not acceptable\" for President Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to have issued public statements condemning the\u00a0woman shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis \"without a full investigation.\"",
      "\"If they're saying we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist,\" Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"Prove to us what documentation you have that one, she was paid and two, that she was agitating when you can hear saying she's not mad, she's not upset, she's clearly trying to waive cars to bypass her. And so it's just this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.\"",
      "Amid an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old American citizen. Video of the incident from different vantage points has ricocheted across social media, with Mr. Trump and Vance insisting Good had instigated the shooting, although the footage is unclear whether Good was attempting to drive into the ICE agent or drive away.",
      "Immediately after the shooting, Noem called it an \"act of domestic terrorism,\" doubling down on Sunday by alleging that Good had\u00a0 \"weaponized her vehicle to conduct an act of violence against the law enforcement officer and the public.\"",
      "In response to Omar's comments on Sunday, a White House spokesperson said \"multiple videos\" contradicted Omar, and insisted the \"ICE officer was clearly struck by Good's car.\"",
      "Minneapolis, which Omar represents in Congress, has been reeling since the shooting, with days of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey told ICE to \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis,\" and Gov. Tim Walz called the federal agency's narrative of the events \"bulls**t.\" Walz added, \"Don't believe this propaganda machine.\"",
      "Omar said she thinks \"it is really important for Americans to record\" ICE agents and law enforcement at protests to \"create the level of accountability and transparency that we need.\"",
      "\"What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars,\" Omar said. \"These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes, they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens. Oftentimes, these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 05:00:10 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Make America Healthy Again\" policies driven by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have made major strides in state legislatures, with food additives among the most common targets.",
    "story": [
      "When one of Adam Burkhammer's foster children struggled with hyperactivity, the West Virginia legislator and his wife decided to alter their diet and remove any foods that contained synthetic dyes.",
      "\"We saw a turnaround in his behavior, and our other children,\" said Burkhammer, who has adopted or fostered 10 kids with his wife. \"There are real impacts on real kids.\"",
      "The Republican turned his experience into legislation, sponsoring a bill to ban seven dyes from food sold in the state. It became law in March, making West Virginia the first state to institute such a ban from all food products.",
      "The bill was among a slew of state efforts to regulate synthetic dyes. In 2025, roughly 75 bills aimed at food dyes were introduced in 37 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Chemical dyes and nutrition are just part of the broader \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda. Promoted by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., MAHA ideas have made their deepest inroads at the state level, with strong support from Republicans \u2014 and in some places, from Democrats. The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program \u2014 created last year as part of the GOP's One Big Beautiful Bill Act to expand health care access in rural areas \u2014 offers incentives to states that implement MAHA policies.",
      "Federal and state officials are seeking a broad swath of health policy changes, including rolling back routine vaccinations and expanding the use of drugs such as ivermectin for treatments beyond their approved use. State lawmakers have introduced dozens of bills targeting vaccines, fluoridated water, and PFAS, a group of compounds known as \"forever chemicals\" that have been linked to cancer and other health problems.",
      "In addition to West Virginia, six other states have targeted food dyes with new laws or executive orders, requiring warning labels on food with certain dyes or banning the sale of such products in schools. California has had a law regulating food dyes since 2023.",
      "Most synthetic dyes used to color food have been around for decades. Some clinical studies have found a link between their use and hyperactivity in children. And in early 2025, in the last days of President Joe Biden's term, the Food and Drug Administration outlawed the use of a dye known as Red No. 3.",
      "Major food companies including Nestle, Hershey, and PepsiCo have gotten on board, pledging to eliminate at least some color additives from food products over the next year or two.",
      "\"We anticipate that the momentum we saw in 2025 will continue into 2026, with a particular focus on ingredient safety and transparency,\" said John Hewitt, the senior vice president of state affairs for the Consumer Brands Association, a trade group for food manufacturers.",
      "This past summer, the group called on its members to voluntarily eliminate federally certified artificial dyes from their products by the end of 2027.",
      "\"The state laws are really what's motivating companies to get rid of dyes,\" said Jensen Jose, regulatory counsel for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit health advocacy group.",
      "Andy Baker-White, the senior director of state health policy for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said the bipartisan support for bills targeting food dyes and ultraprocessed food struck him as unusual. Several red states have proposed legislation modeled on California's 2023 law, which bans four food additives.",
      "\"It's not very often you see states like California and West Virginia at the forefront of an issue together,\" Baker-White said.",
      "Although Democrats have joined Republicans in some of these efforts, Kennedy continues to drive the agenda. He appeared with Texas officials when the state enacted a package of food-related laws, including one that bars individuals who participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 SNAP, or food stamps \u2014 from using their benefits to buy candy or sugary drinks. In December, the U.S. Department of Agriculture approved similar waivers sought by six states. Eighteen states will block SNAP purchases of those items in 2026.",
      "There are bound to be more. The Rural Health Transformation Program also offers incentives to states that implemented restrictions on SNAP.",
      "\"There are real and concrete effects where the rural health money gives points for changes in SNAP eligibility or the SNAP definitions,\" Baker-White said.",
      "In October, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill that sets a legal definition for ultraprocessed foods and will phase them out of schools. It's a move that may be copied in other states in 2026, while also providing fodder for legal battles. In December, San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu sued major food companies, accusing them of selling \"harmful and addictive\" products. The lawsuit names specific brands \u2014 including cereals, pizzas, sodas, and potato chips \u2014 linking them to serious health problems.",
      "Kennedy has also blamed ultraprocessed foods for chronic diseases. But even proponents of the efforts to tackle nutrition concerns don't agree on which foods to target. MAHA adherents on the right haven't focused on sugar and sodium as much as policymakers on the left. The parties have also butted heads over some Republicans' championing of raw milk, which can spread harmful germs, and the consumption of saturated fat, which contributes to heart disease.",
      "Policymakers expect other flash points. Moves by the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are making vaccine access more difficult have led blue states to find ways to set their own standards apart from federal recommendations, with 15 Democratic governors announcing a new public health alliance in October. Meanwhile, more red states may eliminate vaccine mandates for employees; Idaho made them illegal. And Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing to eliminate school vaccine mandates.",
      "Even as Kennedy advocates eliminating artificial dyes, the Environmental Protection Agency has loosened restrictions on chemicals and pesticides, leading MAHA activists to circulate an online petition calling on President Donald Trump to fire EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.",
      "Congress has yet to act on most MAHA proposals. But state lawmakers are poised to tackle many of them.",
      "\"If we're honest, the American people have lost faith in some of our federal institutions, whether FDA or CDC,\" said Burkhammer, the West Virginia lawmaker. \"We're going to step up as states and do the right thing.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

      "The Justice Department has a playbook ready for responding to emergencies like the one unfolding in Minneapolis, including containing unrest and defusing community anger or distrust in law enforcement.",
      "In the civil rights era, the agency formed its Community Relations Service, a group of dozens of federal specialists who were informally referred to as \"America's peacemaker.\"",
      "For the type of crisis emerging in Minneapolis, the Community Relations Service had a long-time, fulltime staffer based in Minnesota, and would also immediately deploy its specialists from Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit, Indianapolis and Madison to get on the ground promptly to assist.",
      "At a time when relations between federal agents and the Minneapolis community, Portland and other U.S. cities have been deteriorating, the Justice Department is being criticized for scrapping its playbook, and turning away its \"peacemakers.\"",
      "Several sources, including current and former Justice Department employees, said the Trump administration has shuttered the office and has begun pushing out many of the approximately 60 employees who served in the Community Relations Service.",
      "In a June 2025 report, the Trump administration said, \"The (community relations service) mission does not comport with Attorney General and Administration law enforcement and litigating priorities.\"",
      "An agency budget request for 2026 showed the Justice Department planned to reduce the office's staffing from 56 to zero. The Justice Department estimates the cuts would save $24 million this year.",
      "Julius Nam, a former Justice Department prosecutor and Community Relations Service specialist told CBS News the office\" has had a neutral, impartial role. That is so important in these situations, in which there is deep distrust of law enforcement by protesters and community groups.\"",
      "The Community Relations Service, whose specialists are referred to as \"conciliators,\" convenes forums, meetings and dialogues to ease tensions and help head off unrest, protests and hate crimes.",
      "In a span from 2021 through 2024, the office conducted more than a dozen formal mediation sessions and more than 100 training programs.",
      "In Minneapolis, the office had some recent successes, in its response to the killing of George Floyd in 2020. An agency report reviewed by CBS News said the Community Relations Service's deployment to Minneapolis during the trial of Floyd's killer was the largest by the office in 2021.",
      "\"The Community Relations Service deployed twice to Minneapolis during the trial and sentencing of Derek Chauvin,\" the report said. \"Despite the challenges of social distancing, CRS conciliators worked for months to build relationships with the community, facilitate dialogues, and lead trainings.\"",
      "Bert Brandenburg, who used to work in the Community Relations Service, told CBS News, \"When we sideline peacemakers, we all pay the price.\"",
      "\"Minnesota is not the first and not the last city where you'd want peacemakers on the streets.\"",
      "Brandenburg said that through its 60-year history, the office was effective in its work to ensure independence and trust among police, local government leaders and communities during conflicts. He said the Community Relations Service would help de-escalate tensions and build up sufficient trust to get both sides of a conflict into a room for discussion and reconciliation.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News the portfolio and functions of the former Community Relations Service have been shifted into federal prosecutors' offices nationwide. The spokesperson said, \"This transition will save the Department over $11 million and further President Trump's mission of having a federal government that's more efficient and effective for the American people.\"",
      "CBS News has learned that approximately 30 laid off Justice Department employees have been called back to work for the agency.\u00a0 Those employees include some who worked for the Community Relations Service. According to one of the impacted employees, the workers have been reassigned to work for federal prosecutors.",
      "Nearly a dozen civil rights organizations and charities filed a civil lawsuit in Massachusetts, seeking a court order to prevent the dismantling of the Community Relations Service. In the lawsuit, in which NAACP St. Louis County and the Haitian Community Help & Support Center are among the plaintiffs, the groups argue the Trump administration's cuts to the office were unlawful and have stymied critical, ongoing work by the Community Relations Service.",
      "The suit said the Trump administration's decision disrupted ongoing de-escalation efforts, including \"mediation among community groups and law enforcement over a race-related policing incident when CRS abruptly [withdrew] from the process, leaving them without a mediator or any final agreement among the parties.\"",
      "\"The Community Relations Service was designed to help de-escalate tensions like those we see in Minneapolis and Portland, and for decades it succeeded in that mission,\" said Stacey Young, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Justice Connection, a group organized in 2025 to help represent and serve ousted Justice Department employees.",
      "Young said, \"For no logical reason, the administration discarded the experts who were best positioned to keep budding conflicts from turning violent. We're seeing the consequences of that fateful decision.\"",
      "A newly introduced federal funding bill aimed at averting a government shutdown next month would allocate $20 million in funding for the Community Relations Service, if approved.",
      "Support for the funding appears highly likely among House and Senate Democrats.",
      "Nearly 100 congressional Democrats have filed a court motion in support of the civil rights groups' legal challenge to the Community Relations Service cuts. Their motion argued the Trump administration was closing the office by \"executive fiat\" and is \"leaving local communities without the vital peacemaking support and services that the agency has long provided.\"",
      "The Community Relations Service was set up in the 1960's, amid metastasizing unrest, including fractured relationships between communities and police departments. The office was credited with helping prevent another riot in 1993, as racial tensions re-emerged following the second trial of police who beat Rodney King in California.",
      "It also helped ease rising racial tensions after the 1997 fatal police shooting of a Chinese-American man in Rohnert Park, California, and in Akron, Ohio in 2022, after the shooting of a Black man by police.",
      "Nam, the former Community Relations Service specialist, told CBS News he expects the Trump administration will shift some of the office's responsibility to its 93 U.S. attorneys' offices nationwide. He said the mission risks failing \u2013 or falling short \u2013 if it operates out of prosecutors' offices. And he added that the Community Relations Service was effective, in part, because it was not connected to law-enforcement agents, and was best positioned to build relationships with people in American communities.",
      "Nam told CBS News, \"Those people could have gone to Minneapolis immediately this week.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump appeared to lay out his red line of action on Friday when he warned that if the Iranian government began \"killing people like they have in the past, we would get involved.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump was briefed on new options for military strikes in Iran, a senior U.S. official confirmed Sunday.",
      "Mr. Trump appeared to lay out his red line for action on Friday when he warned that if the Iranian government began \"killing people like they have in the past, we would get involved.\"",
      "\"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts,\" he said at the White House. \"And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "On social media, Mr. Trump offered his support for the protesters, saying that \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\"",
      "Mr. Trump's warnings come as nationwide unrest challenging Iran's theocracy crossed the two-week mark. At least 538 people have died in violence surrounding the demonstrations, U.S.-based activists said, with fears the death toll is far higher. More than 10,600 people have been arrested, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said.",
      "The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. officials, first reported Saturday night that Mr. Trump had been given military options but hadn't made a final decision. The WSJ reports that Trump will receive further options on Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. has not moved any forces in preparation for potential military strikes.",
      "America has many capabilities and options, and cyber attacks could be among them, according to a U.S. official who also confirmed that the Trump administration approves of Elon Musk's decision to make Starlink terminals available in Iran. That satellite-based internet service could help protestors bypass government restrictions amid the ongoing communications blackout. Starlink did not respond to CBS inquiries.",
      "The U.S. already has heavy sanctions on Iran's regime, and in recent weeks has added to them. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that Mr. Trump has \"moral support\" for actions in Iran. He declined to answer a question about whether the U.S. would interdict vessels carrying Iranian oil for trading on the black market.",
      "\"I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back,\" Wright said.",
      "Iran's theocratic rulers continue to claim that the protesters are agitators influenced by the U.S. and Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Saturday about the protests and other regional issues, according to US officials.",
      "Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Iran's parliament speaker and a hardliner who has run for the presidency in the past, warned Sunday that the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if the U.S. strikes the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" Qalibaf said, according to the Associated Press. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"",
      "On Friday, Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, said on X: \"Our enemies don't know Iran. In the past, the US failed due to their flawed planning. Today too, their flawed scheming will cause them to fail.\"",
      "There are currently 2,000 U.S. troops next door in Iraq, stationed on bases that have previously been targeted by Iranian-backed militias. There are also U.S. forces throughout the Mideast region, including significant hubs in Qatar, home of U.S. Central Command, and Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet is stationed.",
      "Back in June, Iran launched a missile strike on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in retaliation for the U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said on \"Face the Nation\" that U.S. military action in Iran now to help the protesters would be a \"massive mistake.\"",
      "\"It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up,\" Kaine said. \"Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country.\"",
      "Kaine called for maintaining the sanctions pressure, noting that it had been successful against the Assad regime in Syria. Last December, armed rebels previously aligned with terror groups finally ousted Assad from power after a 14 year civil war.",
      "\"U.S. military action would bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States,\" he added.",
      "When asked on Sunday if shooting protesters would be the \"red line\" for Mr. Trump that would trigger U.S. action, a senior U.S. official declined to explicitly confirm it, saying \"only Trump can determine what the red line is.\"",
      "The White House and U.S. State Department have declined to answer questions about specific military options being considered.",
      "The demonstrations began Dec. 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country's economy is squeezed by international sanctions imposed in part to curb its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran's theocracy.",

    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials are set to meet with Danish officials about Greenland on Wednesday, diplomatic sources tell CBS News.",
      "The meeting, which has not been officially announced, comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress last week that President Trump is interested in purchasing the Danish territory. The White House also said Tuesday officials are discussing a wide range of options\u00a0for acquiring Greenland, including using the U.S. military to take it by force.",
      "While Rubio had downplayed the threat of military force in his remarks to reporters, Mr. Trump doubled down on the possibility again on Sunday night, saying, \"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen.\"",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday aboard Air Force One, echoing his previous statement on Friday when he said, \"if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, who met with Danish officials last week, said on Sunday that he thinks Democrats and Republicans in Congress would unite to stop any military action aimed at taking Greenland. \"We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way,\" he said on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"Either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy,\" the Democrat said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0told the New York Times\u00a0in an interview published last week that ownership of Greenland, the world's largest island, was important because \"that's what I feel is psychologically needed for success.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he feels the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland for defense purposes.",
      "The escalatory language by the president in recent weeks has further stressed already strained relations with European allies. Multiple European diplomats told CBS News that they increasingly understand that America's commitment to the defense of Europe and NATO is no longer as ironclad as it has been over the past decades \u2014 or even the past few years of\u00a0the war in Ukraine, during which the U.S. rallied European countries to unify against Russian aggression. One diplomat told CBS News that the Greenland situation is a potential breaking point.",
      "When asked Sunday whether he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the NATO alliance, Mr. Trump said, \"It would save a lot of money. I like NATO. I just wonder whether or not, if we needed NATO, would they be there for us. I'm not sure they would.\"",
      "Louisiana GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, who Mr. Trump appointed as\u00a0special envoy to Greenland\u00a0last month, wrote Sunday on X that \"History matters. The U.S. defended Greenland's sovereignty during WWII when Denmark couldn't.\"",
      "\"After the war, Denmark re-occupied it\u2014side stepping and ignoring UN protocol. This should be about hospitality, not hostility,\" Landry said.",
      "In response, Denmark's Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen said \"facts matter too,\" and pointed out Greenland \"has been a part of the Kingdom of Denmark for centuries.\" He also emphasized that last week, all five of Greenland's parties in Parliament repeated they\u00a0don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "\"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",
      "\"This would be disastrous,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone.\"",

      "Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar denounced a surge of federal agents to Minneapolis targeting Somalis and other immigrants after a fraud scheme in the state, saying the Trump administration has sown \"confusion and chaos.\"",
      "\"It's not necessary in a moment when we are trying to deal with a serious problem that needs serious people to be able to address it,\" Omar said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The Minneapolis area now has one of the largest concentrations of Department of Homeland Security agents in any American city in recent years. There are more than 2,400 federal agents, more than double the number of local police officers, and the federal government intends to send hundreds more.",
      "The administration says the surge has been necessary to conduct both immigration enforcement and to investigate a growing fraud scandal in the state, the cost of which federal prosecutors estimate could top $9 billion. The scandal dates back to 2021, when Biden administration Justice Department investigators first honed in on an at least $250 million COVID-era scam revolving around the Feeding Our Future program, a case that now includes more than 75 defendants.",
      "Most of the defendants are of Somali descent, leading President Trump and other Republican lawmakers to focus attention on the state's large Somali community, while threatening to suspend federal funding to the state across a broad array of programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and child care funding.",
      "These actions have drawn stiff criticism from local officials, including Omar.",
      "\"There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these programs, funding these programs,\" Omar said. \"The only reason they are doing that is for PR purposes. And it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents.\"",
      "In response to Omar's comments, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Sunday that it was \"not surprising\" that the congresswoman is \"more concerned about Somali fraudsters being held accountable for their crimes than she is about the fraud taking place.\"",
      "With Minnesota in the eye of a federal storm, Gov. Tim Walz announced on Jan. 5 that he won't seek reelection. Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during the 2024 presidential election, had become a focus of Republican criticism amid the scandal.",
      "He said last week that he was ending his gubernatorial reelection bid because of the fraud probe, implying that the focus on Minnesota was a political vendetta targeting him, and pleading for the White House to withdraw federal agents.",
      "\"If it's me, you're already getting what you want, but leave my people alone,\" Walz said.",
      "Omar praised Walz's decision as selfless.",
      "\"He wants to focus on defending our state and not defending a seat,\" Omar said.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's photo portrait display at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery has had references to his two impeachments removed, the latest apparent change at the collection of museums he has accused of bias, as he asserts his influence over how official presentations document U.S. history.",
      "The wall text, which summarized Mr. Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \"American Presidents\" exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Mr. Trump taken during his first term. Now, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though\u00a0the text was available online.\u00a0Mr. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen on Sunday, did not include any extended text.",
      "The White House did not say whether it sought any changes. Nor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions. But Mr. Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials\u00a0review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \"ensure alignment with the president's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's original \"portrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Mr. Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \"Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\"",
      "Then the text continues: \"After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\"",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Mr. Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Mr. Trump's \"unmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\"",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Mr. Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries, such as what had been part of Mr. Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",
      "Ingle did not answer questions about whether Mr. Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.",
      "The gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Mr. Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.",
      "\"The museum is beginning its planned update of the America's Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\" the gallery statement said. \"For some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist's name.\"",
      "For now, references to Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton being impeached in 1868 and 1998, respectively, remain as part of their portrait labels, as does President Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation as a result of the Watergate scandal.",
      "And, the gallery statement noted, \"The history of Presidential impeachments continues to be represented in our museums, including the National Museum of American History.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents U.S. history and culture. He has offered an especially harsh assessment of how the Smithsonian and other museums have featured chattel slavery as a seminal variable in the nation's development but also taken steps to\u00a0reshape how he and his contemporary rivals are depicted.",
      "In the months before his order for a Smithsonian review, he fired the head archivist of the National Archives and said he was firing the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, as part of his overhaul. Sajet maintained the backing of the Smithsonian's governing board, but she ultimately resigned.",
      "At the White House, Mr. Trump has designed a notably partisan and subjective \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" featuring gilded photographs of himself and his predecessors \u2014 except Biden, who is represented by an autopen \u2014 along with plaques describing their presidencies.",
      "The White House said at the time that Mr. Trump himself was a primary author of the plaques. Notably, Mr. Trump's two plaques praise the 45th and 47th president as a historically successful figure, while those under Biden's autopen stand-in describe the 46th executive as \"by far, the worst President in American History\" who \"brought our Nation to the brink of destruction.\"",

      "What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes, they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens. Oftentimes, these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country.",

This agent, as you see, gets out of his car, automatically starts running towards her, trying to open her door. She feels scared. She tries to turn the wheel away. And then you see the other officer, who can clearly see the car is moving, move towards the front of the car, which, if they are saying that he has 10 years on service and is trained, he should know that you shouldn't be trying to get in front of a moving car.",

I just want to be abundantly clear, because the administration says that their officers are being stalked and harassed.

      "But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.",

      "The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25-years-in- decline oil industry back going again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as, like, as an American state-owned oil company, essentially?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: No.",
      "Today, we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans.",
      "But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yes, of course, quite likely, you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, back in November, a U.S. judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal.",
      "The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of the Intel company? Do you want to own portions of oil companies?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility.",
      "The Citgo sale is part of \u2013 is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan government. And, of course, one \u2013 one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that.",
      "So, to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally, through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case, absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced the\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an oversupply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Right. Exactly. That's not \u2013 that's not good for American oil and gas companies.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly.",
      "Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies, because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability.",
      "So, President Trump is no \u2013 is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And, certainly, there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that\u2026",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that \u2013 that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan government.",
      "And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. So, Secretary Rubio said there's a three-point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite.",
      "Even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership \u2013 they're already in Venezuela, we should say \u2013 said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50 percent. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there it's at least a year-and-a- half, two years.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and, likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition.",

      "What's new now is the layers of crises facing the regime. Iran has a collapsing currency. There are chronic power and water shortages. I faces punishing sanctions. And it's still absorbing the aftershocks of last year's 12-day war with Israel.",
      "I was in Iran right after that war and people were already quietly questioning the regime's competence and its vulnerabilities. Now those vulnerabilities are loudly being tested in the streets. And there's another crucial difference here, symbolism. We've seen statues of the supreme leader set on fire, surveillance cameras ripped down, as well as chants for the monarchy.",
      "This is not nostalgia. This is a rejection of the Islamic Republic. And the danger for the leaders in Tehran is simple. Once the (INAUDIBLE) breaks, it's very hard to put back.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Imtiaz Tyab, we'll continue to track these protests. Thank you, Imtiaz.",
      "We go now to Richmond, Virginia, where we find Senator Tim Kaine, who has Oversight, Foreign Relations and other key committees.",
      "Senator, we know the president has been briefed on military options. But our reporting is, no decision made, no military assets put in place to execute anything yet. There aren't even any aircraft carriers in the Mideast region at this moment in time.",
      "Would you support military action?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE (D-VA): Margaret, U.S. military action in Iran would be a massive mistake. It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up. Right now Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country. This Iranian regime has spent years focusing outside its borders on fomenting terrorism and aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza, instead of listening to the needs of its own citizens. And much like Syrian citizens finally threw off the yoke of Bashar al Assad, and that brutal regime, without U.S. military intervention, it looks to me that Iran's doing the same.",
      "So, let's celebrate their freedom-loving spirit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Let's keep up the sanctions pressure which helped in Syria, and is helping, I think, dramatize the misdeeds of this regime. But U.S. military action would just bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s, and it would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "You mentioned Syria there. There was some, you know, covert U.S. support. There was something in the beginning at least with that kind of uprising.",
      "Would you support any kind of help? I mean the president saying we're going to help the protesters. What does that mean or what should it look like?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Well, I think, again, let's use sanctions. And in Syria, the Caesar Sanctions that we put in place in 2019 to punish Bashar al Assad for war crimes had a real effect on the Syrian energy, construction and other sectors. And when Syria chose to go a new path, President Trump, with the support of a bipartisan Congress, has reduced those sanctions to open up a new chapter in life for Syria. That's the right answer.",
      "But military action, we did not take military action against Bashar al Assad. We have been engaged militarily in Syria to fight ISIS. Because ISIS was part of al Qaeda, there's a military authorization for use of U.S. force against ISIS.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: We've worked with other nations to reduce them. But we didn't use military action against Bashar al Assad. And we shouldn't use military action against the Iranian government in this \u2013 in this protest moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Let's support these brave freedom fighters in other ways through sanctions but not use our sons and daughters in the military to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just very quickly, when you mentioned there was authorization for force in Syria and ISIS, I assume that means you support the military strikes that took place yesterday against 35 targets in Syria. This was in response to the killing of those two U.S. soldiers and an American interpreter. That's valid in your view?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Yes. Yes, yes, it is legally valid that it has long been held that the 2001 congressional authorization against al Qaeda includes the ability to go against groups that have come out of or have affiliated with al Qaeda that mean harm to the U.S. troops. And in this instance ISIS is still a threat to U.S. troops. There is a legal authorization for the use of force, which is what makes this so different than the use of the military force against Venezuela or Greenland or Cuba or wherever the president wants to take us to war next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're taking me to the next topic, which is this effort you led. You got about five Republican senators to join your effort in this procedural vote to restrict the president's actions. He would require new congressional approval before new military action in Venezuela.",
      "Do you think the Republicans, who were with you on this vote, will stay with you given that the president has openly threatened them?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I think they will. And I think more may join the five Republicans who voted with me.",
      "Let's be clear what they were voting for. The Trump administration has waged war, first against Venezuelan boats in international waters, then covert actions in Venezuela, and now an attack on Venezuela to depose its leadership, to establish a new government that we chose, not that the Venezuelan people chose, to seize Venezuela's economy and even say, we're going to set the terms of economic and political transition for the next few years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: What my Republican colleagues voted for is, let's get this out of the classified and put it before the American public and actually debate this use of the U.S. military on the floor of the United States Senate. Four months into it, hundreds of Venezuelans dead, American troops injured, let's finally debate this publicly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: That's all they voted for. And the fact that the president is going against them, just for wanting to have this debate before the public, shows how nervous the president is about both his legal authority, but also the wisdom of what he's doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, he said publicly, they should not be re-elected because they issued this call for congressional review.",
      "You brought up Greenland. This is \u2013 the territory that Denmark has broad governance over Denmark being a NATO ally. World leaders take President Trump's remarks seriously.",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: And they should.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We take him seriously and literally. And to that point, Denmark's prime minister publicly warned that it would mean the \"end of the NATO alliance\" if he carries out what he said, which as recently as Friday he said, \"I want to make a deal for Greenland the easy way. But if we don't do it the easy way, we are going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Is there anything to stop the president from doing it, quote/unquote, \"the hard way,\" which sounds like military force?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, I think Congress will stop him. Both Democrats and Republicans. This would be disastrous. It wouldn't just be America first. It wouldn't just be the end of NATO. It would be America alone. If we take our best allies, and Denmark has been an ally for a very long time, and we decide that we have the military ability to seize territory for them, you will see the United States, instead of being the world's chief diplomat, and a leader in the world, you'll see the United States isolated as a Priya.",
      "And I've talked to my Republican colleagues. They watch what the president has done in Venezuela. They hear the threats against other nations. I can tell you this, we will force a vote in the Senate about no U.S. military action in Greenland or Denmark. If we need to, we will get overwhelming bipartisan support that this president is foolish it even suggest this.",
      "We're not going to do it the hard way and we're not going to do it the easy way either. We're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for action in Congress on that front.",
      "Senator Kaine, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Republican Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar, who joins us this morning from Miami.",
      "Congresswoman, welcome to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR (R-FL): Thank you for the opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of Maria Corina Machado's top allies in Congress. You've said she is coming to Washington this week. President Trump said maybe Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. Details still being worked out.",
      "Why is it important for her to get in front of the president of the United States, who is backing Maduro's number two as the current president of that country?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: OK, well, I don't think that the president is really backing anyone that is related to the Maduro regime. But concentrating on Maria Corina Machado, she earned it. She was the one who put together this \u2013 she proved to the international community that they, the opposition forces, have won the election. She was able to somehow create the tallies and prove to the Trump administration that they had won 70 by \u2013 to 30. Remember that Maduro did not give her the opportunity to be the presidential nominee because he did not like her, because he knew that he was going to lose against her. So, she has earned it. And I am sure that she will have a very good, long, solid conversation with the president. She knows the story better than anybody.",
      "I was in touch with her during the 16 months that she was hiding in a tunnel because the Maduro forces were looking for her to kill her. So, she has earned it. So, I think we are going to welcome her in Congress, and I'm sure that the \u2013 President Trump is going to be highly, highly pleased with that meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the Energy secretary here say it could be \u2013 it could be years before we get to a transition. The president did say democracy is something he hopes for in Venezuela. Does that mean that she should go back? That the United States should guarantee Maria Corina Machado's security to return? I mean how can the opposition go back for an election right now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Well, you know, she was planning to go \u2013 when we met in Oslo, when she received the Nobel Peace Prize, she was saying to everybody that she was ready to go back when on January 3rd we took Maduro out. They \u2013 I loved what Secretary Rubio is expressing and the plan that we have as a country of stabilize, recover, and transition. I think that, if you think about it, the Trump administration is creating a blueprint, a new groundbreaking, new model for foreign policy when he vis- a-vis the western hemisphere. So, Maria Corina and the opposition forces fall in that three planned layout that we have \u2013 that Rubio has created and Trump has blessed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: So, she is part of the transition. And I am sure that they will be able to reorganize themselves.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: She has hundreds of thousands of people in Caracas and in Venezuela that will help us to put together this electoral system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know that you support the Trump administration's policy. But Secretary of State Rubio really, really bristled when I asked him why they didn't arrest the minister of the interior, Diosdado Cabello, who remains in power. You have been very, very clear in your statements that you think the United States should arrest him. We went back and looked. CBS Miami's Jim DeFede reported in 2017 that Cabello had tried to assassinate Senator Rubio.",
      "Can you help people understand why perhaps people in Florida should be concerned or other Americans about this man remaining in control of security forces?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Well, you know, I know that Diosdado is probably worse than Maduro and worse than Delcy. They're all \"Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves.\" Let's don't make any \u2013 let's make sure, for your international audience, that.",
      "But I am very reassured the fact that we have taken the oil and the resources away from them. That Diosdado Cabello, who is a thief, I repeat, does not want to fall into where Maduro has fallen into. And they will cooperate. And somehow, because we have created this new type of model, that they will work with us. They do not have their resources. Now they know that we're going to go into this recovery. And that \u2013 and that somehow they are going to definitely participate and work with the American forces.",
      "They know better. And like I said, this is impressive what's happening because we have not seen this before in the 250 years of history. And Diosdado, I repeat, is definitely someone who was indicted. And one of the source \u2013 I have some sources that say that we were not able to locate him.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: But at this hour, I would say that everything is really falling into place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he controls the prisons. And there are at least five Americans in those prisons.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: With Delcy. With Delcy. Delcy is the one who is really in charge of the secret police and the repressive apparatus. And Diosdado Cabello was in charge of the military, who was part of this the Suns cartel, along with Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you know why the Trump administration isn't publicly demanding the release of the Americans that are being held?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Listen, maybe we do not know some things that are happening, and Rubio said it the other day. I do understand, and I am sure, Rubio knows the area very well. And he knows who the characters are. And we are definitely taking this with solid \u2013 in a solid \u2013 with solid steps. We do not want to make any mistakes. And I am sure that the political prisoners will be coming out, and that we \u2013 that we're not giving them, meaning Diosdado and Delcy, any type of leeway for them to really run the country. We will see \u2013 like it happened, it happened two, three weeks ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Let's give them a little bit more time before we see more results.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, the president tweeted today, \"Cuba gets no more money, no more oil.\" The CIA assessment is that that regime in Havana is not necessarily in peril, even though the president is saying they are. What are you hearing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Well, look, I represent the city of Miami. You know, the heart of the Cuban exile community. And those words are like magical. It's been 65 years, you know, Cuba is really a center of power for our enemies, Iran, Russia, China. And now I think they are \u2013 they are \u2013 they are getting the memo. And Cuba, it's hanging by a threat. By a thread, I should say.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: The threat that Cuba has represented to the United States has been immense. They have no water. They have no electricity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: They have no food. They have nothing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: So, if you think the Maduro was weak, Cuba is even weaker.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: And now they do not have one drop of oil coming from Venezuela. So, that could be the beginning of the end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Mexico is stepping up and providing them some. We're going to have to watch what happens there next.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR: And that is a very big mistake. Very big mistake from Madam Sheinbaum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, thank you very much, Congresswoman.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This past week marked five years since the January 6th attack on the Capitol. But honoring the first responders who protected the Capitol Building that day from a pro-Trump mob has been neither quick nor easy.",
      "A law passed by Congress in 2022 required the architect of the Capitol to produce a plaque paying tribute to law enforcement and give it a permanent location on the Capitol's west front within one year. Produce it, they did. Photos obtained by CBS News' Scott MacFarlane last year show the plaque itself. But more than five years late, the plaque has not found a permanent home on Capitol Hill.",
      "The delay is owed in part to House Speaker Mike Johnson, whose office says the law is, quote, \"not implementable\" because the law called for a tribute to law enforcement members, while the plaque itself honors whole departments rather than individual officers by name.",
      "North Carolina Republican Senator Thom Tillis paid tribute to the actions of law enforcement on that day, calling it \"a wonderful stress test for democracy.\"",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "SENATOR THOM TILLIS (R-NC): We heard thousands of people storm this Capitol. People died. Police officers were injured, hospitalized. One died shortly after January the 6th. A lot of people said that was a dark day for democracy. I would leave you with this, it was a great day for democracy because of the law enforcement officers, the people that kept us safe. Because you know what we did when confronted with thousands of thugs storming this building? We took a brief recess, we got ourselves together, the Capitol was secured. And before we left this compound, we came back and completed our constitutional duty to certify the election.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: At Tillis' urging, the Senate voted by a procedure known as unanimous consent to make any changes needed to the original law in order to get the plaque installed once and for all. Not a single senator objected.",

      "Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said Sunday that it's \"quite likely\" American companies will have an expanded presence in Venezuela's oil industry as the country moves on following the removal of former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\"That's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility,\" Wright said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "But Wright said the U.S. has not taken over running Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA oil and gas company. President Trump on Friday met with oil executives at the White House, and his administration is pressing U.S. oil companies to reenter Venezuela.",
      "\"No, today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers. And then that crude goes out into the market,\" Wright said. \"We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans.\"",
      "U.S. forces captured and removed Maduro and his wife on Jan. 3 and brought them to New York to face federal charges alleging narco-terrorism and cocaine importation, among other charges. Maduro and his wife have pleaded not guilty. Wright said the U.S. expects change to come fast to the South American country.",
      "\"With United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think\u2026.we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela,\" said Wright. \"This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.\"",
      "Wright said that means working with officials in the current government Maduro left behind, even though many of them have been indicted in the U.S. Those officials include Diosdado Cabello, the powerful Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, a strongman who has also previously been indicted in the U.S.",
      "\"We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the meantime is a collapse of the nation,\" Wright said.",

Does that mean that she should go back, that the United States should guarantee Maria Corina Machado's security to return? I mean, how can the opposition go back for an election right now?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, you know, she was planning to go when we met in Oslo, when she received the Nobel Peace Prize, she was saying to everybody that she was ready to go back, when on January 3, we took Maduro out. They- I love what Secretary Rubio is expressing and the plan that we have as the country of stabilize, recover, and transition. I think that if you think about it, the Trump administration is creating a blueprint, a new ground breaking, new model for foreign policy, when he- vis-a-vis the western hemisphere. So Maria Corina and the opposition forces fall in that three-planned layout that we have, that Rubio has created and Trump has blessed. So she is part of the transition, and I am sure that they will be able to reorganize themselves. She has hundreds of thousands of people in Caracas and in Venezuela that will help us to put together this electoral system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know that you support the Trump administration's policy, but Secretary of State Rubio really, really bristled when I asked him why they didn't arrest the Minister of the Interior, Diosdado Cabello, who remains in power. You have been very, very clear in your statements that you think the United States should arrest him. We went back and looked, CBS Miami's Jim DeFede reported in 2017 that Caballo had tried to assassinate Senator Rubio. Can you help people understand why perhaps people in Florida should be concerned or other Americans about this man remaining in control of security forces?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, you know, I know that just Diosdado is probably worse than Maduro and worse than Delcy. They're all Alibaba and the 40 Thieves. Let's- don't make any- let's make sure, for your international audience, that- but- but I am very reassured the fact that we have taken the oil and the resources away from them. That Diosdado Cabello, who is a thief, I repeat, does not want to fall into where Maduro has fallen into, and they will cooperate. And somehow, because we have created this new type of model, that they will work with us, they do not have their resources now they know that we're going to go into this recovery, and that- and that somehow they are going to definitely participate and work with the American forces. They know better. And like I said, this is impressive what's happening, because we have not seen this before in 250 years of history. And Diosdado, I repeat, is definitely someone who was indicted. And one of the source- I have some sources that say that, that we were not able to locate him, but it did- at this hour, I would say that, that everything is really falling into place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he controls the prisons, and there are at least five Americans in those prisons--",
      "REP. SALAZAR: -- With Delcy. With Delcy. Delcy is the one who is really in charge of the secret police and the repressive apparatus. And Diosdado Cabello was in charge of the military, who was part of the Sun's cartel along with Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you know why the Trump administration isn't publicly demanding the release of the Americans that are being held?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Listen, maybe- maybe we do not know some things that are happening, and Rubio said it the other day. I do understand, and I am sure, Rubio knows the area very well, and he knows who the characters are. And we are definitely taking this with- with solid in- a solid- with solid steps. We do not want to make any mistakes and- and I am sure that the political prisoners will be coming out and that we- that we're not giving them, meaning Diosdado and Delcy, any type of- of leeway for them to really run the country. We will see. Like it happened- it happened two, three weeks ago. Let's give them a little bit more time before we see more results.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, the President tweeted today, Cuba gets no more money, no more oil. The CIA assessment is that that regime in Havana is not necessarily in peril, even though the President's saying they are. What are you hearing?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, look, I represent the city of Miami, you know, the heart of the Cuban exile community. And those words are like, magical. It's been 65 years. You know, Cuba is- is really a center of power for our enemies, Iran, Russia, China. And- and now I think they are- they are getting the memo. And Cuba, it's- it's hanging by your threat, by a thread I should say. The threat that Cuba has represented to the United States has been immense. They have no water, they have no electricity, they have no food. They have nothing. So if you think that Maduro was weak. Cuba is even weaker, and now they do not have one drop of oil coming from Venezuela. So that could be the beginning of the end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Mexico is stepping up and providing them some. We're going to have to watch--",
      "REP. SALAZAR: -- And that is a very big mistake. A very big mistake from Madame Sheibaum--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- what happens next. \u00a0 All right. Thank you very much, Congresswoman. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Richmond, Virginia, where we find Senator Tim Kaine, who has oversight in foreign relations and other key committees. Senator, we know the president has been briefed on military options, but our reporting is no decision made, no military assets put in place to execute anything yet. There aren't even any aircraft carriers in the Mideast region at this moment in time, would you support military action?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, U.S. military action in Iran would be a massive mistake. It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up. Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country. This Iranian regime has spent years focusing outside its borders on fomenting terrorism and aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza, instead of listening to the needs of its own citizens, and much like Syrian citizens, finally threw off the yoke of Bashar al-Assad and that brutal regime without U.S. military intervention, it looks to be that Iran is doing the same. So let's celebrate their freedom loving spirit. Let's keep up the sanctions pressure, which helped in Syria and is helping, I think, dramatize the- the misdeeds of this regime. But U.S. military action would just bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Syria there. There was some, you know, covert U.S. support. There was something in the beginning, at least with that kind of uprising, would you support any kind of help? I mean, the president saying we're going to help the protesters. What does that mean? Or what should it look like?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, I think again, let's use sanctions. In Syria, the Caesar sanctions that we put in place in 2019 to punish Bashar al-Assad for war crimes had a real effect on the Syrian energy, construction and other sectors. And when Syria chose to go a new path, President Trump, with the support of a bipartisan Congress, has reduced those sanctions to open up a new chapter in life for Syria. That's the right answer, but military action, we did not take military action against Bashar al-Assad. We have been engaged militarily in Syria to fight ISIS, because ISIS was part of al-Qaeda, there's a Military Authorization for Use of U.S. Force against ISIS. We've worked with other nations to reduce them, but we didn't use military action against Bashar al-Assad. And we shouldn't use military action against the Iranian government in this- in this protest moment, let's support these brave freedom fighters in other ways, through sanctions, but not use our sons and daughters in the military to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just very quickly, when you mentioned there was authorization for force in Syria and ISIS, I assume that means you support the military strikes that took place yesterday against 35 targets in Syria. This was in response to the killing of those two U.S. soldiers and an American interpreter. That's valid, in your view?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Yeah, yeah, it is legally valid that it has long been held that the 2001 congressional authorization against al-Qaeda includes the ability to go against groups that have come out of or have affiliated with al-Qaeda that mean harm to the U.S. troops. And in this instance, ISIS is still a threat to U.S. troops. There is a legal authorization for the U.S. of force, which is what makes this so different than the use of the military force against Venezuela or Greenland or Cuba or wherever the president wants to take us to war next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're taking me to the next topic, which is this effort you led. You got about five Republican senators to join your effort in this procedural vote to restrict the president's actions, he would require new congressional approval before new military action in Venezuela. Do you think the Republicans who were with you on this vote will stay with you, given that the president has openly threatened them?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think they will, and I think more may join. The five republicans who voted with me, let's be clear what they were voting for. The Trump administration has waged war, first against Venezuelan boats in international waters, then covert action in Venezuela, and now an attack on Venezuela to depose its leadership, to establish a new government that we chose, not that the Venezuelan people chose, to seize Venezuela's economy and even say we're going to set the terms of economic and political transition for the next few years. What my Republican colleagues voted for is, let's get this out of the classified and put it before the American public and actually debate this use of the U.S. military on the floor of the United States Senate. Four months into it, hundreds of Venezuelans dead, American troops injured, let's finally debate this publicly. That's all they voted for, and the fact that the president is going against them just for wanting to have this debate before the public, shows how nervous the president is about both his legal authority, but also the wisdom of what he's doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, he said publicly they should not be re-elected because they- they issued this, this call for congressional review. You brought up Greenland. This is the- the territory that Denmark has broad governance over, Denmark being a NATO ally. World leaders take President Trump's remarks seriously. We take him seriously and literally. And to that point, Denmark's Prime Minister publicly warned that it would mean the end of the NATO alliance if he carries out what he said. Which as recently as Friday, he said, I want to make a deal for Greenland the easy way, but if we don't do it the easy way, we are going to do it the hard way. Is there anything to stop the president from doing it quote, unquote, \"the hard way,\" which sounds like military force?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think Congress will stop them, both Democrats and Republicans. This would be disastrous. It wouldn't just be \"America First.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone. If we take our best allies, and Denmark has been an ally for a very long time, and we decide that we have the military ability to seize territory for them, you will see the United States, instead of being the world's chief diplomat and a leader in the world, you'll see the United States isolated as a pariah. And I've talked to my Republican colleagues, they- they watch what the president has done is Venezue- in Venezuela. They hear the threats against other nations. I can tell you this, we will force a vote in the Senate about no U.S. military action in Greenland or Denmark. If we need to, we will get overwhelming bipartisan support that this president is foolish to even suggest this. We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way, either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for action in Congress on that front. Senator Kaine, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, President Trump vowed that Venezuela now has the military protection of the US. This comes just one week after he said the US would run that country. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is expected to travel to Washington to meet with President Trump this week. For his part, Mr. Trump and his team met with dozens of US oil executives late last week, urging them to commit $100 billion to boost oil production there. Joining us now to discuss it all is the United States Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, good to have you here in person.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I ask you about Venezuela, very quickly, these protests in Iran, not this country reliant on oil to keep its government controlled economy afloat. The President has been briefed on military options. What is the US willing to do to help?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Certainly the President has been very outspoken about wanting to have freedom and rule of law and capitalism and great relations with the United States return. So we'll see. I think his moral support has been strong. Certainly, he's taken a strong stance against the mullahs in Iran in disabling their nuclear program. I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back. I won't go into the specifics there, but we wish them well, and we'd love to see a free and democratic Iran again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will there be more interdictions of vessels carrying Iranian oil? Any more activity on that front?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I won't reveal any change in position there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, let me ask you about Venezuela,",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: where you have been very focused and very central to the President's policy. The President said that Venezuela now has the United States, the most powerful military in the world, to protect them. To protect them, we will.\u00a0 Is the United States military providing security guarantees for American companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We're not doing that right now, but what we, what he means, is we're changing the game for what's happening in the ground in Venezuela. Venezuela has purchased $20 billion of Russian weapons. They got Cuban mercenaries there. They supply oil to Cuba. They, they harbor the Hezbollah's headquarters for the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place going down the tubes. And with the United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we're going to, we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela. This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's off to a quick start. You had the oil executives at the White House just Friday. That the President, excuse me, the State Department yesterday had a security alert I want to ask you about because it specifically cited the risk to Americans in Venezuela, and it said armed militias are setting up roadblocks, searching vehicles for evidence of US citizenship or support for the US. The man who runs those militias is Diosdado Cabello, who is the Minister of the Interior. Is he ordering the hunting of Americans?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Not that we are aware of, but we should be cautious. Look, this is, as they say, eight days into a change into a change of leadership there. The interim authorities are trying to establish power. Collectivos have been running wild over, over Venezuela for, for over a decade. So, yeah, you're not going to\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well he controls them.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: He does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is he safe in his position? Because right now the administration seems to be working with him.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not concerned he's going to undermine the more business minded President Delcy Rodriguez?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Oh, of course we're worried about things like that. We need to get stability among the leadership in Venezuela. So yes, of course we're concerned about those things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me broadly, is the Trump administration's goal here to acquire the state oil company, PDVSA, and to run it. Are you going to put Americans on the board? How is this going to work?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, again, it's a process. The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25 years in decline, oil industry back going again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as like as an American state owned oil company essentially?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: No. Today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans. But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yeah, of course, quite likely you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So back in November, us, Judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal. The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of an intel company, do you want to own portions of oil companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility. The Citgo sale is part of, is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan Government. And of course, one, one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that so to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case. Absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an over supply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. That's not- That's not good for American oil and gas companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability. So President Trump is no, is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And certainly there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that\u2013",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: That went through a large auction to buy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible, to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan Government. And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So Secretary Rubio said there's a three point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite, even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership, they're already in Venezuela, we should say, said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50%. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there, it's at least a year and a half, two years.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition. We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela. We don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today. We'd like to move and get there, but America\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a timeline?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT:\u00a0 25 years, this country has gone in decline. President Trump out of the box, creative intervention has allowed us to change the game. But, yeah, I don't know the timeline of that. It's not weeks, it's more months. Could be a year or two could be more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Secretary Wright, thank you for your time today.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents a large portion of that city. It's good to have you here.",
      "REP. ILHAN OMAR: I represent the whole city. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. The Trump administration is actively telling the public that journalists are misleading them. You heard what was just reported from the scene. What we know is that Renee Macklin Good and her partner were protesters. They were driving around Minneapolis. They were recording what some of these ICE enforcement officers were doing. And the local police chief says Macklin Good blocked the street with her car. President Trump has said that the partner was a paid agitator, that's the phrase he used. Secretary Noem alleged this was an act of terrorism. Given how much heat there is and the administration's scrutiny, would you tell Americans it's too dangerous to demonstrate and to go out and document as she was doing?",
      "REP. OMAR: I think it is really important for Americans to record to create the level of accountability and transparency that we need. What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes these people are citizens. Oftentimes these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you see from the recordings that we see, is there anything that you believe was- that was being done that should not have been done by Macklin Good? The administration says she was blocking the road. They are claiming this is an act of terrorism.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah. Renee Nicole Good, as you hear her say, she's not mad. She's sitting in her car peacefully, waving cars to get by this agent, as you see, gets out of his car, automatically starts running towards her, trying to open her door. She feels scared, she tries to turn the wheel away. And then you see the other officer- who can clearly see the car is moving, move towards the front of the car. Which, if they are saying that he has 10 years on service and is trained, he should know that you shouldn't be trying to get in front of a moving car, and so it is not acceptable for Kristi Noem and the president and the vice president to make these kind of judgments without there being a full investigation, even though we can see in the videos that have been produced so far that what they are describing is really not what is taking place. And so if they're saying that we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist. Prove to us what documentation you have. That, one, that she was paid. Two, that she was agitating when we can hear her say she's not mad, she's not upset. She's clearly trying to wave cars to bypass her. And so it's just- this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just quickly on that you said accountability, and it's important for people to document what's happening. I just want to be abundantly clear, because the administration says that their officers are being stalked and harassed. When you say accountability, you are only describing recording like she was doing?",
      "REP. OMAR: I think it is fair for citizens to document what law enforcement is doing\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's been violence against some of these agents as well.",
      "REP. OMAR: Well, there's also been violence against residents in Minneapolis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There right now is a lot of heat on your state. Treasury Secretary Bessent called Minnesota ground zero for what may be the most egregious welfare scam in our nation's history to date. 85 of the 98 people who were charged by the Justice Department with this welfare scheme are Somali. And you know this, the treasury secretary is probing whether any of the money was somehow funneled outside the country, he actually issued new standards. He's going to make it- make someone disclose if they receive public assistance when they try to wire money out of the country, and he's lowered the bar for suspicious activity. What is the practical impact of doing that in the community?",
      "REP. OMAR: It's just creating fear. What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would. There is no justification in any of the things that they say. The 87 people that you've described as being investigated, many of them adjudicated, all happened under the Biden administration. There is no justification for this surge. We know that ICE has the ability to conduct raids. There is no reason have over 2000 people coming in to our city and creating the level of terror that they have created.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration argues that they have to do it because the state failed to, right--",
      "REP. OMAR: The state- the federal government and the state have been working peacefully together and have brought justice to these 87 people that you've described. None of the surge that they have conducted has produced any sort of criminal activity. They haven't been able to charge anyone as of yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration also announced they're going to cut food stamps to Minnesota because they say some of the food stamp money had been embezzled. Are you confident--",
      "REP. OMAR: And those are the things that are being litigated, and it is again, unconstitutional for them to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it- are you confident that the fraud that has been discovered is no longer being conducted now? Is there any justification for saying this food stamp money is somehow being misused?",
      "REP. OMAR: There are ways to investigate fraud, which we have been doing in Minnesota, which the federal government has been doing under the Biden administration. There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these- funding these programs. The only reason they are doing that is for PR purposes, and it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents, and it is creating the kind of chaos and confusion that no one needs in this moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration and many conservative allies in the administration argue that this is still ongoing. There was that conservative influencer who went out and posted this video that went viral, alleging that daycare facilities were pocketing public funds--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. OMAR: And as you know, he went hours where these businesses were not operating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep, CBS went out and did its own investigation--",
      "REP. OMAR: --yeah which, again creates the level of confusion and chaos that is not necessary in a moment when we are trying to deal with a serious problem that needs serious people to be able to address it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think- there was no recorded evidence of fraud, according to the CBS investigation that was conducted, but Governor Walz did choose to not run for reelection. He dropped out of the race because of all of this.",
      "REP. OMAR: Because he wants to focus on defending our state and not defending a seat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think there has been a sufficient level of accountability and ownership of the failure to have oversight here? Do you think this ends?",
      "REP. OMAR: That is what we want. We want to collaborately [sic] work with the administration to try to make sure that there is no fraud that's being perpetuated on our state. What we do not want is the level of terror, of confusion, of chaos that is being created without any results in this moment.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, before I let you go, the Chair Oversight Committee said that he wants to refer you to the Ethics Committee.",
      "REP. OMAR: I've been referred like 100 times, so go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's looking at your husband's income and net worth. He said it was tied to private equity investment funds, but he seems to be insinuating that you personally are tied into this welfare scam. How do you respond to that?",
      "REP. OMAR: Ever since I've gotten to Congress, they have been doing these sort of weird ethics investigations, none of them have yielded anything because I have been as transparent as I can be, and there is nothing wrong with any documentation that I have ever provided to the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Omar, thank you for joining us today. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

Any exemptions to the rule have to be approved by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who signed the new memo.",

Before that policy, issued in June, ICE had historically allowed members of Congress to visit its detention facilities, without prior notice.",

    "published": "Sat, 10 Jan 2026 14:57:08 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump called for a one-year cap on credit card interest rates late Friday, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is calling for a 10% cap on credit card interest rates for one year, an idea that has drawn strong support from lawmakers in both parties but pushback from card issuers.",
      "\"Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30%, and even more, which festered unimpeded during the Sleepy Joe Biden Administration,\" the president wrote on Truth Social late Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump said the cap on interest rates should begin on Jan. 20, 2026, or the one-year anniversary of his second inauguration.",
      "Credit card interest rates currently average over 20%, according to Federal Reserve statistics, so a 10% cap would represent a significant cut in borrowing costs.",
      "It's unclear if the president will attempt to enforce his proposed 10% cap through some kind of executive action, or if his goal is to pressure credit card issuers to slash their rates voluntarily. CBS News has reached out to the White House and some of the largest credit card issuers in the U.S. for comment.",
      "Supporters point to trillions in credit card debt",
      "The idea of capping credit card interest rates has drawn bipartisan support. Last year, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with Democrats, teamed up to introduce legislation that would impose a 10% cap. A similar measure was also introduced in the House by Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida.",
      "Other recently proposed legislation would impose less stringent caps on fees and interest rates.",
      "Mr. Trump also called for temporarily capping interest rates at 10% on the campaign trail. Hours before the president's late Friday Truth Social post, Sanders criticized Mr. Trump on X\u00a0 for not following through on his pledge to limit interest rates.",
      "Supporters of the idea say it would aid scores of Americans who are languishing under mountains of credit card debt, and argue that credit card issuers can afford to cut their rates.",
      "Americans owed a total of $1.23 trillion in credit card balances in the third quarter of last year, the highest level on record, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A 2024 study by NerdWallet found that the average U.S. household with credit card debt owed $10,563. Meanwhile, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in 2023 that credit card rates have soared \"far above the cost of offering credit.\"",
      "\"We cannot continue to allow big banks to make huge profits ripping off the American people,\" Sanders said in a joint press release with Hawley last year.",
      "Said Luna: \"For too long, credit card companies have abused working class Americans with absurd interest rates, trapping them in an almost insurmountable amount of debt.\"",
      "Opponents argue a credit card rate cap could backfire",
      "Opponents of a cap, including banks and other credit card issuers, warn that limits on interest rates may force lenders to stop issuing credit cards to many riskier borrowers.",
      "A coalition of groups that represent banks \u2014 including the American Bankers Association and the Bank Policy Institute \u2014 argued in a statement to CBS News on Friday that a 10% interest rate cap \"would reduce credit availability and be devastating for millions of American families and small business owners who rely on and value their credit cards, the very consumers this proposal intends to help.\"",
      "The Bank Policy Institute estimated last year that more than 14 million American households that rarely pay their credit card balances in full could have their access to credit eliminated or curtailed by a 10% cap. Millions of people who sometimes pay off their balances could also face new restrictions, the group said.",
      "The American Bankers Association has\u00a0argued in the past that if credit card issuers end up needing to cut off access for \"all but the lowest-risk customers,\" many people who are in need of loans would be forced to shift to \"less regulated alternatives\" that often charge even higher rates, like payday lenders and pawn shops.",
      "Billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who backed Mr. Trump in his 2024 campaign, called the idea a \"mistake.\" He\u00a0wrote on X\u00a0that if card issuers are prevented from charging high enough interest rates to cover their losses and earn solid returns, \"credit card lenders will cancel cards for millions of consumers who will have to turn to loan sharks.\"",
      "Ackman later wrote: \"Finding a way to bring down credit card rates without taking credit away from many Americans would have a very positive impact on the most disadvantaged Americans.\"",
      "Scott Simpson, CEO of the trade group America's Credit Unions, told CBS News in a statement: \"While we appreciate the President's desire to increase affordability, the plain truth is that capping rates at 10% does not make credit more affordable, it makes it unattainable for millions of working Americans because financial institutions will not be able to offer credit cards to most consumers at a 10% rate.\"",
      "The Electronic Payments Coalition \u2014 which represents credit card issuers and payment networks \u2014 said \"a one-size-fits-all 10% cap risks making things worse by reducing access to credit and limiting choice.\"",
      "Trump pledges to deal with affordability",
      "The push to cap credit card interest rates is the latest proposal by Mr. Trump to cut borrowing costs, as he grapples with widespread concerns about affordability.",
      "Earlier this week, Mr. Trump directed the federal government to buy $200 million in mortgage bonds using cash from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in an effort to drive down mortgage rates.",
      "The president has also urged the Federal Reserve to more aggressively cut its benchmark interest rate, which influences borrowing costs for everything from mortgages and car loans to commercial loans \u2014 though rate cuts by the Fed could run the risk of causing inflation to surge.",
      "Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming weeks, and told reporters last month he's \"looking for somebody that will be honest with interest rates.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump disclosed U.S. jobs data the day before the Department of Labor released\u00a0hiring numbers for December, a closely watched economic report on Wall Street that can sway financial markets.",
      "At 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u00a0posted a graph depicting changes in private and government employment since January 2025. When the full jobs report was released Friday morning, it became clear that Mr. Trump's post had incorporated the December employment data because the totals in the chart matched figures released in the monthly report.",
      "Mr. Trump brushed off the incident. \"I don't know if they posted them,\" he told reporters Friday afternoon. \"They gave me some numbers. When people give me things, I post them.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's post came after he was briefed on the employment numbers, calling it an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information.\"",
      "The White House is now reviewing its protocols for economic data releases, the official added.",
      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2025, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",
      "Federal economic data is held under strict embargo until its scheduled release because the information has the potential to move financial markets. Providing some investors with access to such data could allow them to place trades based on knowledge unavailable to other investors.",
      "White House economic officials are provided with an advance copy of the Labor Department's employment report each month on Thursday afternoon and sign agreements to keep the numbers confidential, though they also write up a summary for the president, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Data leaks can undermine investor confidence, as markets expect officials to keep a tight lid on economic reports until they're released publicly, Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, told CBS News.",
      "\"Markets don't react kindly to that, because obviously it means that perhaps a select few may have been able to front-run on that news ahead of the market at large,\" he said.",
      "Erica Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unit that compiles the monthly employment figures, said that premature disclosures of the agency's data can be punished by fines and even jail time. But previous breaches typically have been met with a slap on the wrist, she noted.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump's inadvertent data release.",
      "No market disruption",
      "Although some investors could have acted on the information Mr. Trump posted on Thursday, there were no evident signs of a change in trading or market prices related to the jobs data, said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge.",

    "story": [
      "The\u00a0killing of a Minnesota woman\u00a0by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer is reverberating across Capitol Hill, where Democrats and certain Republicans are vowing an assertive response as President Trump's aggressive deportation operations spark protests nationwide.",
      "Lawmakers are demanding a range of actions, from a full investigation into\u00a0Renee Good's shooting death\u00a0and policy changes over law enforcement raids to the defunding of ICE operations and the impeachment of\u00a0Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, in what is fast becoming an inflection point.",
      "\"The situation that took place in Minnesota is a complete and total disgrace,\" House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said as details emerged. \"And in the next few days, we will be having conversations about a strong and forceful and appropriate response by House Democrats.\"",
      "Yet there is almost no consensus among the political parties in the aftermath of the death of Good, who was behind the wheel of an SUV after dropping off her 6-year-old at school when she was shot and killed by\u00a0an ICE officer.",
      "The killing immediately drew dueling narratives. Mr. Trump and Noem said the\u00a0ICE officer acted in self-defense, while Democratic officials said the Trump administration was lying and they urged the public to see the viral videos of the shooting for themselves.",
      "Vice President\u00a0JD Vance\u00a0blamed Good, calling it \"a tragedy of her own making,\" and said the ICE officer may have been \"sensitive\" from having been injured during an unrelated altercation last year.",
      "But Good's killing, at least the fifth known death since the administration launched its mass deportation campaign, could change the political dynamic.",
      "\"The videos I've seen from Minneapolis yesterday are deeply disturbing,\" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, in a statement.",
      "\"As we mourn this loss of life, we need a thorough and objective investigation into how and why this happened,\" she said. As part of the investigation, she said she is calling for policy changes, saying the situation \"was devastating, and cannot happen again.\"",
      "Homeland Security funding up for debate",
      "The push in Congress for more oversight and accountability of the administration's immigration operations comes as lawmakers are in the midst of the annual appropriations process to fund agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to prevent another\u00a0federal government shutdown\u00a0when money expires at the end of January.",
      "As anti-ICE demonstrations erupt in cities in the aftermath of Good's death, Democrats have pledged to use any available legislative lever to apply pressure on the administration to change the conduct of ICE officers.",
      "\"We've been warning about this for an entire year,\" said Rep. Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat.",
      "The ICE officer \"needs to be held accountable,\" Frost said, \"but not just them, but ICE as a whole, the president and this entire administration.\"",
      "Congressional Democrats saw Good's killing as a sign of the need for aggressive action to restrain the administration's tactics.",
      "Several Democrats joined calls to impeach Noem, who has been under fire from both parties for her lack of transparency at the department, though that step is highly unlikely with Republicans in control of Congress.",
      "Other Democrats want to restrict the funding for her department, whose budget was vastly increased as part of the Republicans' sweeping tax and spending bill passed last summer.",
      "Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, the top Democrat on the subcommittee that handles Homeland Security funding, plans to introduce legislation to rein in the agency with constraints on federal agents' authority, including a requirement that the Border Patrol stick to the border and that DHS enforcement officers be unmasked.",
      "\"More Democrats are saying today the thing that a number of us have been saying since April and May: Kristi Noem is dangerous. She should not be in office, and she should be impeached,\" said Democratic Rep. Delia Ramirez, who represents parts of Chicago where ICE launched an enhanced immigration enforcement action last year that resulted in two deaths.",
      "Immigration debates have long divided Congress and the parties. Democrats are splintering between more liberal and stricter attitudes toward newcomers to the United States. Republicans have embraced Trump's hard-line approach to portray Democrats as radicals.",
      "The Republican administration had launched the enforcement operation in Minnesota in response to an investigation of the nonprofit Feeding Our Future. Prosecutors said the organization was at the center of the country's largest COVID-19-related fraud scams, when defendants exploited a state-run, federally funded program intended to provide food for children.",
      "Heading into the November midterm election, which Democrats believe will hinge on issues such as affordability and health care, national outcry over ICE's conduct has pressured lawmakers to speak out.",
      "\"I'm not completely against deportations, but the way they're handling it is a real disgrace,\" said Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, a Texas Democrat who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "\"Right now, you're seeing humans treated like animals,\" he said.",
      "Other ICE shootings have rattled lawmakers",
      "In September, a federal immigration enforcement agent in Chicago\u00a0fatally shot Silverio Villegas Gonzalez\u00a0during a brief altercation after Gonzalez had dropped off his children at school.",
      "In October, a Customs and Border Protection agent, also in Chicago, shot Marimar Martinez, a teacher and U.S. citizen, five times during a dispute with officers. The charges against Martinez brought by the administration were dismissed by a federal judge.",
      "To Rep. Chuy Garcia, a Democrat from Illinois, Good's death \"brought back heart-wrenching memories of those two shootings in my district.\"",
      "\"It looks like the fact that a US citizen, who is a white woman, may be opening the eyes of the American public, certainly of members of Congress, that what's going on is out of control,\" he said, \"that this isn't about apprehending or pursuing the most dangerous immigrants.\"",
      "Republicans expressed some concern at the shooting but stood by the administration's policy, defended the officer's actions and largely blamed Good for the standoff.",
      "\"Nobody wants to see people get shot,\" said Rep. Rich McCormick, a Republican from Georgia.",
      "\"Let's do the right thing and just be reasonable. And the reasonable thing is not to obstruct ICE officers and then accelerate while they're standing in front of your car,\" he said. \"She made a mistake. I'm sure she didn't mean for that to happen, nor did he mean for that to happen.\"",

    "story": [
      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "But there's more at play here, including a valuable shipping route and access to mineral resources.",
      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",
      "Greenland's underground resources",

      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that his country wants good relations with the U.S. and did not \"think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight, and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation.\"",
      "A poll conducted a year ago showed that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News ahead of a visit last year to the island by Vice President JD Vance and his wife.",
      "A brief history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency.",
      "It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",

    "published": "Thu, 08 Jan 2026 06:53:37 -0500",
    "summary": "Fossilized bones and teeth dating to 773,000 years ago are providing a deeper understanding of the emergence of Homo sapiens.",
    "story": [
      "Where did our species first emerge? Fossils discovered in Morocco dating back more than 773,000 years bolster the theory that Homo sapiens originally appeared in Africa, scientists said in a study Wednesday.",
      "The oldest Homo sapien fossils, dating from over 300,000 years ago, were found at the Jebel Irhoud northwest of Marrakesh.",
      "Our cousins the Neanderthals\u00a0mostly lived in Europe, while more recent additions to the family, the Denisovans, roamed Asia.",
      "This has prompted an enduring mystery: who was the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and our cousins, before the family tree split off into different branches?",
      "This divergence is thought to have occurred between 550,000 and 750,000 years ago.",
      "Until now, the main hominin fossils from around that time period were found in Atapuerca, Spain.",
      "They belonged to a species dubbed \"Homo antecessor,\" dated back around 800,000 years ago, and had features that were a mix of the older Homo erectus and those more similar to Homo sapiens and our cousins.",
      "This sparked a contentious debate about whether our species originally emerged outside of Africa, before returning there.",
      "There was \"a gap in the fossil record of Africa,\" French paleoanthropologist and lead study author Jean-Jacques Hublin told AFP.",
      "The research published in the journal Nature fills that gap by finally establishing a firm date for fossils discovered in 1969 inside a cave in the Moroccan city of Casablanca.",
      "Over three decades, a French-Moroccan team unearthed hominin vertebrae, teeth and fragments of jaws that have puzzled researchers.",
      "Researchers said a thigh bone found in the cave had bite marks suggesting the person may have been killed or scavenged by a predator, the Reuters news agency reported.",
      "\"Only the femur displays clear evidence of carnivore modification - gnawing and tooth marks - indicating consumption by a large carnivore,\" Hublin told Reuters. \"However, the cave appears primarily to have been a carnivore den that hominins used only occasionally. The absence of tooth marks on the mandibles does not imply that other parts of the bodies were not consumed by hyenas or other carnivores.\"",
      "A slender lower jawbone discovered in 2008 proved particularly perplexing.",
      "\"Hominins who lived half a million or a million years generally didn't have small jawbones,\" Hublin said.",
      "\"We could clearly see that it was something unusual -- and we wondered how old it could be.\"",
      "However numerous efforts to determine its age fell short.",
      "When Earth's magnetic field flipped",
      "Then the researchers tried a different approach.",
      "Every once in a while, Earth's magnetic field flips. Until the last reversal -- 773,000 years ago -- our planet's magnetic north pole was near the geographic south pole.",
      "Evidence of this change is still preserved in rocks around the world.",
      "The Casablanca fossils were discovered in layers corresponding to the time of this reversal, allowing scientists to establish a \"very, very precise\" date, Hublin said.",
      "This discovery eliminates the \"absence of plausible ancestors\" for Homo sapiens in Africa, he added.",
      "Antonio Rosas, a researcher at Spain's National Museum of Natural Sciences, said it adds \"weight to the increasingly prevalent idea\" that the origins of both our species and the last common ancestor of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals/Denisovans lie in Africa.",
      "\"This work also suggests that the evolutionary divergence of the H. sapiens lineage might have started earlier than is conventionally assumed,\" Rosas, who was not involved in the research, commented in Nature.",
      "Like Homo antecessor, the Casablanca fossils have a mix of characteristics from Homo erectus, ourselves and our cousins.",
      "But while clearly closely related, the Moroccan and Spanish fossils are not the same, which Hublin said is a sign of \"populations that are in the process of separating and differentiating.\"",
      "The Middle East is considered to have been the main migration route for hominins out of Africa, however sinking sea levels at certain times could have allowed crossings between Tunisia and Sicily -- or across the Strait of Gibraltar.",
      "So the Casablanca fossils are \"another piece of evidence to support the hypothesis of possible exchanges\" between North Africa and southwestern Europe, Hublin said.",
      "The study was published just weeks after scientists said newly discovered fossils prove that a mysterious foot found in Ethiopia belongs to a little-known, recently named ancient human relative who lived alongside the species of the famous Lucy.",

      "The photo, Fincke added, \"was taken as we prepared our space suits for return - a normal, methodical step in getting ready to come home, and a reminder that this decision was made calmly and carefully, with people at the center.\"",
      "Crew 11's early return marks the first time in NASA history that a crew has been told to cut its mission short because of a medical issue.",
      "James Polk, NASA's chief medical officer, said Friday that according to statistical analyses, \"we should have had a medical evacuation approximately every three years ... and we've not one to date.\"",
      "\"Even in this case, we're erring on the side of caution,\" he said. \"Again, it's not an emergent evacuation, but we are erring on the side of caution for the crew member and in their best interest.\"",
      "Fincke plans to turn over command of the station to cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov during a brief ceremony Monday afternoon.",

We expect to provide a further update within the next 48 hours as to the expected, anticipated undock and re-entry timeline.\"",
      "In keeping with the agency's strict medical privacy policy, NASA officials have not identified the astronaut in question or provided any details about the nature of the medical issue.",
      "But the ailing astronaut is a member of NASA's Crew 11, made up of commander Zena Cardman, veteran astronaut Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov.",
      "They were launched to the International Space Station on Aug. 1 aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship. They were planning to return to Earth around Feb. 20, after their Crew 12 replacements arrive.",
      "Fincke and Cardman were planning to venture outside the space station on Thursday to complete a support truss for an add-on solar array and to carry out a variety of other tasks.",
      "But on Wednesday, NASA announced the spacewalk had been called off due to a \"medical concern\" with one of the Crew 11 astronauts. The agency said the crew member was \"stable,\" but no other details were provided.",
      "Polk said Thursday that the astronaut in question was not injured or made ill by any operational aspect of living aboard the space station, adding that spacewalk preparations played no role in the incident.",
      "Isaacman said the planned early return of Crew 11 did not represent an \"emergency,\" adding the agency was simply erring on the side of caution to ensure the health and well-being of the astronaut. Even so, Crew 11's early return will mark the first time in U.S. space history that a mission has been cut short due to a medical issue.",
      "Polk agreed it was not an emergency, adding \"This is not an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations, but unrelated to the operational environment that we have right now. It's mostly having a medical issue in the difficult areas of microgravity and with the suite of hardware that we have at our disposal available to complete a diagnosis.\"",
      "Space station crews have extensive medical equipment on board and crew members are trained to serve as medical officers.",
      "Physician and former astronaut Tom Marshburn told CBS News that space station crews are \"equipped to deal with all the things that have happened in space over the 65 years of human spaceflight, any of those things that come up. Even to the some extreme examples, like a heart attack, something like that. We have the tools to do it.",
      "\"We just can't sustain somebody sick for a really long period of time, just for a few days, perhaps. But pretty much any medical event that you can imagine ... could happen up there, yeah.\"",
      "Amit Kshatriya, NASA's associate administrator, said Crew 11 will follow normal procedures when returning to Earth where they will splash down in the Pacific Ocean off the Southern California coast. SpaceX support crews and NASA flight surgeons will be standing by aboard the company's Crew Dragon recovery ship. The crew will be flown to shore by helicopter and then fly by jet back to the Johnson Space Center.",
      "\"As Dr. Polk mentioned, it's the first time we've done a controlled medical evacuation from the vehicle, so that is unusual,\" Kshatriya said. \"What's important to us is the whole crew, and we don't want to do anything, given the nature of the condition, that we put any other additional risk on the crew by diverging from our normal processes. So that's why we're doing essentially a controlled expedited return.\"",
      "The space station is continuously staffed by a crew of seven. Three launch and return to Earth aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft and four fly to and from the lab aboard NASA-managed SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ships.",
      "Both spacecraft serve as lifeboats during a crew's long-duration space station stay. If a Soyuz or Crew Dragon flier gets sick or is seriously injured aboard the station, that person is joined by all of his or her crewmates for the flight back to Earth.",
      "Because of the ever-present chance that a Soyuz or Crew Dragon might have to depart early, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon.",
      "The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one spacecraft depart early and take all its crew members with it.",
      "For that reason, after Crew 11 undocks from the station, NASA will still have one astronaut \u2014 Chris Williams \u2014   aboard to operate systems in the lab's U.S. modules. He was launched to the outpost in November aboard a Soyuz spacecraft along with two Russian crewmates.",
      "A one-time volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician with a Ph.D. in astrophysics from MIT, Williams was a board-certified medical physicist at Harvard Medical School when selected to join NASA's astronaut corps in 2021.",
      "With the departure of Crew 11, Williams would be on his own managing the U.S. segment of the space station until Crew 12 arrives in February.",
      "Crew 12 commander Jessica Meir, a space station veteran, rookies Jack Hathaway and European Space Agency astronaut Sophie Adenot and veteran cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are scheduled for launch Feb. 15.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are looking into moving that launch up a few days amid work to ready a Space Launch System rocket for takeoff as early as Feb. 6 to send four astronauts on a looping fight around the moon.",
      "The high-profile Artemis 2 mission will be the first to send astronauts to the vicinity of the moon in more than 50 years. Isaacman said he did not think the early return of Crew 11 and the possibly early launch of Crew 12 would have any impact on the moon mission.",

    "summary": "NASA said the unidentified astronaut is \"stable,\" but the agency is considering all options, including a possible early return to Earth for Crew 11",
    "story": [
      "A spacewalk planned for Thursday outside the International Space Station was called off late Wednesday because of a \"medical concern\" with an unidentified crew member, NASA said in a statement.",
      "An update shortly before midnight said the agency was exploring \"all options, including the possibility of an earlier end to Crew 11's mission.\"",
      "\"These are the situations NASA and our partners train for and prepare to execute safely,\" the update said. \"We will provide further updates within the next 24 hours.\"",
      "While NASA did not identify the astronaut in question or explain the medical issue \u2014 standard practice due to privacy concerns \u2014 the agency said \"the matter involved a single crew member who is stable.\"",
      "Space station commander Mike Fincke, flight engineer Zena Cardman, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov launched to the space station aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon ferry ship on August. 1.",
      "Going into the new year, the crew expected to remain in space until their replacements arrive in mid-February. Crew 11's return to Earth is expected around Feb. 20. That's still the official plan.",
      "In the meantime, Cardman, 38, and Fincke, 58, a veteran of nine spacewalks on earlier missions, were planning to venture outside the station Thursday to finish building a truss needed to support a set of roll-out solar arrays and to carry out other planned maintenance.",
      "A second spacewalk by two yet-to-be-announced astronauts was planned for next week.",
      "But NASA called off the the first spacewalk earlier Wednesday, saying \"the agency is monitoring a medical concern with a crew member that arose Wednesday afternoon. Due to medical privacy, it is not appropriate for NASA to share more details about the crew member.\"",
      "\"The situation is stable. NASA will share additional details, including a new date for the upcoming spacewalk, later.\"",
      "In a brief space-to-ground radio exchange just after 2:30 p.m. EST, Yui called mission control in Houston and asked for a private medical conference, or PMC.",
      "Mission control replied that a PMC, using a private radio channel, would be set up momentarily. Yui then asked if a flight surgeon was available and if flight controllers had a live camera view from inside the station.",
      "\"Houston, do we still have, like, a camera view in Node 2, uh, 3, lab?\" Yui asked.",
      "\"We don't have any internal cameras right now, but we can put the lab view in if you'd like,\" the mission control communicator replied.",
      "\"I appreciate that,\" Yui replied. He then asked: \"Do you have like a crew surgeon? ... A flight surgeon?\"",
      "No additional exchanges were heard. Later Wednesday, NASA's space station audio stream, normally carried live around-the-clock on YouTube, went silent without explanation.",

    "published": "Tue, 06 Jan 2026 14:13:05 -0500",
    "summary": "The hydrogen cloud is a remnant of the universe's early formation, NASA said in a news release.",
    "story": [
      "A team of researchers discovered a new type of astronomical object that may help experts learn more about the formation of galaxies and the development of the early universe.",
      "NASA dubbed the object \"Cloud-9\" and described it as a \"starless, gas-rich dark-matter\" hydrogen cloud and remnant of the universe's early formation about 14 million light-years from Earth. Scientists have theorized about such an object, but this is the first time one has been confirmed to exist, NASA said. These types of clouds are believed to be dark matter clouds that couldn't accumulate enough gas to form stars, NASA said.",
      "Cloud 9 was identified three years ago, but it wasn't until recently that the Hubble Space Telescope could be used to confirm there were no stars inside. Alejandro Benitez-Llambay, an assistant professor at Italy's Milano-Bicocca University and the principal investigator on the Hubble team, said that Cloud-9 tells the \"tale of a failed galaxy.\"",
      "\"In science, we usually learn more from the failures than from the successes,\" Benitez-Llambay said. \"In this case, seeing no stars is what proves the theory right. It tells us that we have found in the local universe a primordial building block of a galaxy that hasn't formed.\"",
      "The core of Cloud-9 is made up of neutral hydrogen. It is about 4,900 light-years in diameter, NASA said. The hydrogen is estimated to measure one million times the mass of the sun.",
      "Cloud-9 also includes a huge amount of dark matter -- about five billion solar masses worth, NASA said. Andrew Fox, a member of the team who studied the object, called it a \"window into the dark universe.\"",
      "\"We know from theory that most of the mass in the universe is expected to be dark matter, but it's difficult to detect this dark material because it doesn't emit light,\" said Fox. \"Cloud-9 gives us a rare look at a dark-matter-dominated cloud.\"",
      "NASA said the cloud also \"suggests the existence of many other small, dark matter-dominated structures in the universe.\" Those kind of objects can be hard to study, because nearby bright features like stars and galaxies outshine them. Researchers also typically focus their attention on those brighter structures, NASA said. Because those items are hard to study, the findings from Cloud-9 help provide new insights, NASA said.",
      "Cloud-9 is the ninth gas cloud identified on the outskirts of the nearby spiral galaxy Messier 94, NASA said. Cloud-9 is smaller, more compact and highly spherical compared to those other clouds. It also appears to have a \"physical association\" with Messier 94, NASA said.",
      "Astronomers will conduct further surveys into Cloud-9 to learn more about dark matter, failed galaxies and the early universe itself, NASA said. They will also search for other similar objects.",
      "\"Among our galactic neighbors, there might be a few abandoned houses out there,\" said researcher Rachael Beaton, of the Space Telescope Science Institute.",
      "Cloud-9 may continue to change and could even grow into a galaxy if it continues to expand, NASA said.",

    "summary": "Jaimee Seitz said her daughter was convinced to take her own life by members of the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shootings, violence and nihilism.",
    "story": [
      "Thirteen-year-old Audree loved to play Nirvana on guitar, draw anime characters and read the series \"Spy School,\" her mother, Jaimee Seitz said.",
      "\"She had her own personality, her own hobbies, her own everything,\" said Seitz, who lives in Kentucky. \"Audree was one of a kind.\"",
      "A week after her 13th birthday, Audree died by suicide. \"I never believed ever my child would take her life,\" said Seitz. \"I believed it was an accident.\"",
      "Days later, a detective called Seitz to tell her that Audree's journal contained drawings of school shooters. On Roblox, Discord and TikTok, she had been interacting with children and adults in the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shooters and encourage violence and self-harm. Seitz said Audree was only 8 years old when she was first exposed to TCC.",
      "\"I think she felt a sense of comfort with this group, with being a part of something, and I believe that they pushed her to do it,\" Seitz said.",
      "Extremism experts classify TCC as a subculture of nihilistic violent extremism, in which participants are not motivated by a particular ideology but instead driven by a generally misanthropic worldview. Some are driven by a desire to achieve notoriety within online communities through violence or self harm, while others target and exploit vulnerable individuals.",
      "The FBI has seen a 300% increase in nihilistic violent extremism cases from September 2024 to September 2025, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. In December, Patel wrote on X that the FBI is pursuing hundreds of nihilistic violent extremism cases, including many from another network called 764.",
      "\"This is one of the most serious issues in America,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "The FBI confirmed to CBS News that it had been in touch with Audree's family, but declined to comment further on her case or answer general inquiries about nihilistic violent extremism.",
      "\"It's something that was so mind blowing \u2014 that it started at such a young age and that she was groomed into this ideology of worshipping school shooters, \" Seitz said. \"It's hard to wrap your head around.\"",
      "What is TCC?",
      "People who identify as being a part of TCC become fascinated with mass killers and develop fan-like behaviors, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works toward solutions to combat extremism.",
      "While the fixation on high-profile killers predates the internet, the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 ushered in a new era of fandom.",
      "\"We've seen this behavior with respect to serial killers and to mass shooters going back well before Columbine, Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News. \"What Columbine did was it gave it a distinct aesthetic.\"",
      "TCC fans substitute aesthetics for ideology, according to researchers \u2014 such as dressing in perpetrators' style and taking up their interests, like favorite songs, rather than adopting their particular motivations.",
      "Online, those active in the TCC share violent \"gore\" videos, create and commission fan art of mass shooters and sometimes interact with people plotting attacks, said David Riedman, an assistant professor at Idaho State University who created a database to track school shootings.",
      "Illustrations, video edits and photo collages romanticizing and sympathizing with perpetrators of the Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook school shootings are easy to find in TCC-tagged posts on platforms including Tumblr, TikTok and X. The community is considered niche \u2014 CBS News identified posts on these platforms with \"likes\" ranging in the thousands.",
      "Riedman said few people in TCC circles will actually go on to commit acts of violence. But a small portion do, with devastating consequences.",
      "Seven recent shootings in U.S. K-12 schools have been linked to TCC, according to Riedman's data. Eleven people were killed and 53 more were injured in the attacks, which took place over the last two years. Five of the shooters took their own lives as well.",
      "Just last month, police charged a 17-year-old in Indiana linked to TCC who was allegedly plotting to carry out an attack. A search of her phone revealed a drawing of the Columbine perpetrators and screenshots from a Discord conversation between her and a friend who encouraged her to livestream an attack, an affidavit obtained by CBS News alleged.",
      "When people active in the TCC carry out shootings, they sometimes become new idols within the community and inspire more violence. The 15-year-old girl behind the\u00a0December 2024 shooting that killed a teacher and a student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is one example.",
      "A month later, a Tennessee teenager she followed on X shot a student in his school and then himself. Posts from an X account believed to be his encouraged her to livestream the Wisconsin attack, CBS News found. In the days after, he posted defending her and calling her a hero.",
      "In August and September, two more individuals linked to TCC, one in Minnesota and another in Colorado, carried out deadly school shootings before killing themselves. The Colorado perpetrator posted on violent gore sites about previous shootings, the Anti-Defamation League found. YouTube videos posted by the Minnesota perpetrator and reviewed by CBS News showed written references to school shooters \u2014 including the name of the Abundant Life perpetrator \u2014 on his weapons and a journal.",
      "The perpetrator behind the Abundant Life shooting \"wanted that notoriety,\" Zoschak said.",
      "\"It was about her,\" he added. While ideologically motivated violence aims to have an effect on society, he said, \"nihilistic violence is about fulfilling an inward-focused need.\"",
      "How children get pulled in",
      "TCC can hold an appeal for young people who are experiencing bullying or feel like they don't identify with other kids, Riedman said.",
      "\"You start to meet people that will like all of your photos and will share your content and are inviting you to come to their private chats,\" Riedman said. \"Now you have this community that you don't have anywhere else.\"",
      "Seitz said she believes Audree may have been drawn to the group for its embrace of kids who feel alienated from their classmates.",
      "\"It was hard for her to find her spot in seventh grade,\" she said.",
      "Seth, 29, was a part of the TCC community and ran a Columbine blog on Tumblr when he was a teenager. He told CBS News he was struggling with mental illness at the time and identified with the perpetrators of school shootings.",
      "\"I was very angry, and so it's like, oh, OK, here are these people who are angry,\" said Seth, who asked that his last name be withheld. \"They're doing something about it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Tumblr wrote in a statement that the platform \"does not allow content that encourages or incites violence or that glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.\"",
      "Seitz wants social media platforms to face accountability. Despite enabling parental controls on Audree's phone, she said, her daughter was steeped in TCC content for years. This fall, she filed suit against Roblox, Discord and TikTok.",
      "The complaint alleges that the apps prioritize user growth over safety and that they are aware that \"the design of their apps makes children easy targets for predatory behavior.\"",
      "In statements to CBS News, spokespeople from each platform wrote that the companies employ technologies to detect harmful content and remove what violates their policies. A Roblox spokesperson said the platform bans \"content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, extremist organizations, or their ideologies.\" A Discord spokesperson said \"the actions of extremist groups or extremism behavior have no place on Discord.\"",
      "After CBS News inquired about several TCC-related hashtags, TikTok removed one of them from the platform. A spokesperson also said accounts that promote or glorify violence are taken down and banned.",
      "Seitz said she hadn't heard of TCC before Audree's death, and she never heard her daughter talk about school shooters. But TCC references understood by those in the community can fly under the radar of unknowing parents and peers.",
      "When Seitz searched \"True Crime Community\" on TikTok after Audree's death, drawings she recognized from her daughter flooded the screen.",
      "\"Everything started to click within not even two minutes,\" she said.",
      "She realized cartoon illustrations Audree had drawn depicted the Columbine perpetrators. A previous TikTok username of Audree's had referenced one of them.",
      "There had even been a TCC reference in a T-shirt Audree asked for. The Columbine perpetrators wore T-shirts for a German industrial band. The Wisconsin shooter was pictured in a shirt for the same band, and Audree wanted to wear one too.",
      "After reflecting on the way Audree's phone was positioned when she discovered her after her death, Jaimee also now believes that her daughter was attempting to livestream her suicide \u2014 something Zoschak said he has seen before among TCC fans.",
      "\"Whether you think your child is seemingly happy, you never know,\" Seitz said. \"And that's the scary part of it \u2014 that's what terrifies me the most.\"",
      "A new category of extremism",
      "The misanthropic violence, absent of ideology, exhibited by attackers involved in TCC has been categorized as nihilistic violent extremism \u2014 a term that has increasingly appeared in Justice Department announcements of criminal charges across the country.",
      "Some nihilistic violent extremists carry out violence with the goal of hastening the collapse of society \u2014 a philosophy known as accelerationism.",
      "But for most, experts said, their mindset mostly revolves around nihilism \u2014 the belief that life and society are meaningless and that moral values are baseless.",
      "In recent months, authorities have taken particular note of the nihilistic violent extremist network 764, with more than 300 investigations into the network ongoing, according to the FBI.",
      "Similar to TCC, 764 lacks a specific ideology, but members more openly encourage self-harm and violence than those in TCC do. Perpetrators associated with 764 encourage victims to produce videos documenting acts of self-harm or child sexual abuse material. Last month, lawmakers introduced a bill that would make it a federal crime to coerce children into self-harm.",
      "Nihilistic online communities like TCC and 764 are also often overlapping.",
      "\"They're all aware of each other,\" Zoschak said. \"It's not like these are isolated ecosystems \u2014 they interact with each other.\"",
      "Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, estimates that there are about 10,000 nihilistic violent extremism perpetrators involved in online grooming around the world \u2014 and 100,000 victims. He said these extremist networks are constantly growing as members try to recruit more victims, and the law enforcement response is further complicated by the younger age groups involved.",
      "\"We do not charge 13-year-old children with adult-level crimes on a regular basis,\" Kriner said.",
      "Seth, who left TCC after seeking mental health treatment, said it's important for children who feel drawn to the TCC community as an outlet to know that there are other options.",
      "\"I got really into art after I left the community, I got into writing,\" he said. \"That was a dark period of my life, but it doesn't need to define you.\"",

    "story": [
      "Meta has cut a trio of deals to power its artificial intelligence data centers, securing enough energy to light up the equivalent of about 5 million homes.",
      "The parent company of Facebook on Friday announced agreements with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra for nuclear power for its Prometheus AI data center that is being built in New Albany, Ohio. Meta announced Prometheus, which will be a 1-gigawatt cluster spanning across multiple data center buildings, in July. It's anticipated to come online this year.",
      "Financial terms of the deals with TerraPower, Oklo and Vistra were not disclosed.",
      "The Mark Zuckerberg-led Meta said in a statement on Friday that the three deals will support up to 6.6 gigawatts of new and existing clean energy by 2035. A single gigawatt, according to a general industry standard for utilities, can power about 750,000 homes.",
      "\"These projects add reliable and firm power to the grid, reinforce America's nuclear supply chain, and support new and existing jobs to build and operate American power plants,\" the company said.",
      "Meta said its agreement with TerraPower will provide funding that supports the development of two new Natrium units capable of generating up to 690 megawatts of firm power with delivery as early as 2032. The deal also provides Meta with rights for energy from up to six other Natrium units capable of producing 2.1 gigawatts and targeted for delivery by 2035.",
      "Meta will also buy more than 2.1 gigawatts of energy from two operating Vistra nuclear power plants in Ohio, in addition to the energy from expansions at the two Ohio plants and a third Vistra plant, Beaver Valley, near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.",
      "The deal with Oklo, which counts OpenAI's Sam Altman as one of its largest investors, will help to develop a 1.2 gigawatt power campus in Pike County, Ohio, to support Meta's data centers in the region.",
      "The nuclear power agreements come after Meta announced in June that it reached a 20-year deal with Constellation Energy to secure power from its nuclear plant in Clinton, Illinois.",

      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

    "story": [
      "Google on Thursday unveiled new artificial intelligence features in Gmail, an effort by the technology giant to refresh its 22-year-old messaging app amid growing use of AI.",
      "The advancements include helping users write messages, finding information buried in email inboxes and delivering daily to-do lists. Gmail's new AI features initially will only be available in English within the U.S. Some features will be accessible to all users free of charge, while others require G1 Ultra and Pro subscriptions.",
      "Alphabet-owned Google is rolling out the new email tools as the company weaves functionality from its latest large language model, Gemini 3, into its online search and other applications. Yet the push comes amid mounting privacy concerns around the use of generative AI, including its potential access to personal information.",
      "Personalized writing aid",
      "With the new features, all Gmail users will have access to what Google calls a 'Help Me Write' tool, which assists users with their grammar and phrasing. The tech analyzes users' previous emails to better understand their writing style so it can personalize emails and make real-time suggestions on how to respond to a message.",
      "Gmail will also offer an AI Overview feature, which summarizes email exchanges and highlights key takeaways from longer threads.",
      "Both features will be available on the Web and mobile versions of Gmail.",
      "\"This is us delivering on Gmail proactively having your back,\" said Blake Barnes, a Google vice president of product.",
      "Google is offering paid Pro and Ultra subscribers access to technology that lets users ask natural-language questions directly in the Gmail search bar. Subscribers will also have access to a dedicated chatbot for follow-up questions.",
      "For example, instead of manually searching for last month's electric bill, a user could ask, \"How much was my electric bill last month?\" Gemini would scan the user's email history, highlight the information and provide direct access to any relevant messages.",
      "Another feature, \"AI Inbox,\" is also being rolled out to a handful of customers for testing. When it's turned on, the function will sift through inboxes and suggest to-do lists and topics that users might want to explore.",
      "Meanwhile, the so-called\u00a0 \"Catch me up\" tool will provide users with reminders of their upcoming events and appointments. This includes but is not limited to upcoming reservations, purchases and deliveries, and cancelled or rescheduled appointments.",
      "How to opt out",
      "Incorporating AI directly into Gmail could pose risks for Google, given that large language models can sometimes present erroneous or misleading information. And although users can proofread AI-aided messages before they're sent, the tech could potentially make mistakes.",
      "Still, Gmail users can turn off the AI features. To do so, users should open their Gmail account settings and, under the \"General\" tab, scroll to the \"Smart\" features and personalization section. Users should then uncheck \"Turn on smart features in Gmail, Chat, and Meet,\" and then save their changes.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department Friday stemming from a criminal investigation into its chair, Jerome Powell, he said in a video statement Sunday.",
      "The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Powell's testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in June 2025, according to Powell.",
      "\"That testimony concerned in part a multi-year project to renovate historic Federal Reserve office buildings,\" Powell said.",
      "The project and Powell's testimony came under scrutiny by the Trump administration last year, with Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought accusing Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law.\"",
      "In his testimony to the Senate, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens, disputing claims made by Vought.",
      "\"I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one \u2014 certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve \u2014 is above the law,\" Powell said Sunday. \"But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration's threats and ongoing pressure.\"",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts. The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president,\" Powell said.",
      "Video message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell: https://t.co/5dfrkByGyX pic.twitter.com/O4ecNaYaGH",
      "In a statement, a Department of Justice spokesperson said Attorney General Pam Bondi \"has instructed her U.S. Attorneys to prioritize investigating any abuse of taxpayer dollars,\" but did not refer to any specific case.",
      "President Trump told NBC News Sunday night he didn't know about the Powell probe. \"I don't know anything about it, but he's certainly not very good at the Fed, and he's not very good at building buildings,\" he remarked.",
      "Bloomberg reported\u00a0on Monday that Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte was the instigator behind the Powell subpeona. Pulte said Monday that the Justice Department is \"out of my purview,\" and he didn't \"know anything about it.\" The\u00a0Government Accountability Office is investigating Pulte for his actions\u00a0at the helm of FHFA, which the GAO said in December includes \"referrals of New York Attorney General Letitia James, U.S. Senator Adam Schiff, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and Congressman Eric Swalwell to the U.S. Department of Justice for mortgage fraud.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council chief Kevin Hassett, rumored to be one of Mr. Trump's top choices to replace Powell when his term is up at the Fed this year, said Monday morning that he \"respects the independence of the Justice Department and the Fed.\"",
      "Asked if he was worried about volatility in the markets due to the Fed tumult, Hassett said: \"I would expect that the markets would be happy to see that there's more transparency at the Fed.\"",
      "Bipartisan criticism",
      "Senators from both sides of the aisle blasted the investigation.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, said in a statement that, \"If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump Administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question. I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed\u2014including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy\u2014until this legal matter is fully resolved.\"",
      "Tillis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, which will hold confirmation hearings and vote on the president's pick to replace Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve. The committee has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, so his opposition could prevent the committee from advancing the nomination for a full Senate vote.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called the probe \"an assault on the Fed's independence.\"",
      "\"This is the kind of bullying that we've all come to expect from Donald Trump and his cronies. Anyone who is independent and doesn't just fall in line behind Trump gets investigated,\" Schumer said on social media.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, said in a statement that the president \"is abusing the authorities of the Department of Justice like a wannabe dictator so the Fed serves his interests, along with his billionaire friends. This Committee and the Senate should not move forward with any Trump nominee for the Fed, including Fed Chair.\"",
      "And Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat form Virginia who also sits on the Banking Committee, issued a statement saying, \"The Fed was designed to operate independently, insulated from political pressure, so that it can make tough decisions based on data and the long-term health of the economy, not the whims of any one president. ... Uncertainty and instability can ripple through the economy, affecting borrowing costs and making it harder for families to buy a home, run a small business, or afford everyday necessities like food, fuel, and diapers.\"",
      "Powell was first nominated as Fed chair by Mr. Trump\u00a0during his first term, replacing Janet Yellen, an appointment of President Barack Obama, and the Senate\u00a0confirmed Powll\u00a0in an 84-13 vote. Former President Joe Biden\u00a0nominated him to a second term, keeping him in office until May 2026.",
      "For months last year, Mr. Trump expressed his unhappiness with the Fed's decision to leave interest rates stable. The president\u00a0argued\u00a0that inflation was already low enough to start cutting rates. It wasn't until late 2025 that the Fed started cutting rates.",
      "The president has repeatedly threatened to fire Powell, including as recently as last month.",
      "Closing out his statement Sunday, Powell said, \"I have served at the Federal Reserve under four administrations, Republicans and Democrats alike. In every case, I have carried out my duties without political fear or favor, focused solely on our mandate of price stability and maximum employment. ... I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do, with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\"",

      "When Kassidy Hooter learned in December how much her health insurance costs were going to rise this year, she went into panic mode.",
      "The Shreveport, Louisiana, resident and mother of three knew she urgently needed care \u2014 Hooter is in the final trimester of a high-risk pregnancy. But the family could no longer afford their Affordable Care Act plan coverage now that a federal tax subsidy was lapsing on Dec. 31, 2025, meaning they would face thousands of dollars in additional out-of-pocket costs.",
      "\"We heavily considered that it might just be cheaper to give birth at home,\" Hooter, 24, told CBS News. \"Just because that's an insane amount of debt to take on.\"",
      "In the end, Hooter decided to forgo insurance altogether.",
      "A local medical center offered three months of financial aid that will carry her through her due date in February and into late March. After that, she will have to bear any medical expenses on her own. Her plan now is to get her newborn on Medicaid, a government health plan for low-income Americans, as quickly as possible.",
      "\"I'm just hoping for the best,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Health insurance as \"luxury\"",
      "Since its introduction in 2010, the ACA has been instrumental in cutting the share of uninsured Americans from approximately 15% to 8%, according to Nima Sheth, vice president of health justice at the National Partnership for Women and Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.",
      "However, the number of people without health insurance is likely to surge if Congress fails to come up with a solution for the 22 million Americans who received an ACA tax credit, experts warn. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates\u00a0that millions of people will lose coverage unless the subsidies are extended.",
      "Americans in most states have until Jan. 15 to enroll in an ACA marketplace plan, according to healthinsurance.org.",
      "Without the tax credits, premiums for ACA enrollees who previously relied on the subsidies will increase by an average of 114%, estimates\u00a0KFF, a nonprofit provider of health policy news and research.",
      "\"What we're seeing here is a policy choice \u2014 is, in effect, turning insurance into a luxury item and medical debt into the default,\" Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at health care advocacy group Community Catalyst, told CBS News.",
      "The House of Representatives on Thursday\u00a0approved a three-year extension\u00a0of the expired ACA tax credits. The legislation faces an uphill climb in the Republican-led Senate, although lawmakers think it could provide a starting point for a compromise that would keep the credits alive in some form.",
      "The CBO estimates\u00a0that the House bill would increase the deficit by around $81 billion from 2026 to 2035. At the same time, the measure would boost the number of people with health insurance, a CBO spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me\"",
      "Plantation, Florida, resident Stacy Kanas, whose family also received an ACA tax credit, is now considering going without health insurance after realizing that her monthly premium to cover her and her husband would rise to $2,500 \u2014 more than double what she was paying last year to cover both of them plus her 20-year-old daughter.",
      "\"It's weighing extraordinarily heavily on me,\" Kanas, 59, told CBS News. \"My husband had a major surgery about five years ago, and we don't want to be uninsured.\"",
      "Although in decent health, the small business owner worries about what could happen if someone in her family falls seriously ill. \"You're one catastrophic event away from perhaps having a financial disaster,\" she said.",
      "Even people who keep their ACA coverage could end up skipping out on care to avoid out-of-pocket expenses, experts said.",
      "\"If you're underinsured and you have high deductibles, the coverage that you're getting is designed to dissuade getting care, including preventative care, so you're going to delay your care until there are emergencies,\" Sternthal said.",
      "Robert Myers, a consultant based outside of St. Louis, Missouri, was on a silver ACA plan last year, but switched to a bronze plan after learning his premiums would rise to $400 a month, up from $17 in 2025.",
      "Under his new plan, the 31-year-old does not have a monthly premium. However, Myers could owe much more in out-of-pocket costs due to $80 co-pays and an $8,000 deductible. As a result, he's planning on scaling back on doctor's visits, a trend experts say ends up driving more people to the emergency room for care.",
      "\"They'll kind of go to the ER and get what they need fixed with a band aid, and then not get long-term care,\" Sheth said.",
      "This can have wider ripple effects because an increase in uncompensated hospital care can drive up costs for other patients, as facilities seek to recoup the costs, according to Sternthal, who supports an extension of the ACA tax credits.",
      "\"Every delay locks families into decisions that harm their health and their financial stability, but then also reverberates out into the business community, the local community,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Jaimee Seitz said her daughter was convinced to take her own life by members of the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shootings, violence and nihilism.",
    "story": [
      "Thirteen-year-old Audree loved to play Nirvana on guitar, draw anime characters and read the series \"Spy School,\" her mother, Jaimee Seitz said.",
      "\"She had her own personality, her own hobbies, her own everything,\" said Seitz, who lives in Kentucky. \"Audree was one of a kind.\"",
      "A week after her 13th birthday, Audree died by suicide. \"I never believed ever my child would take her life,\" said Seitz. \"I believed it was an accident.\"",
      "Days later, a detective called Seitz to tell her that Audree's journal contained drawings of school shooters. On Roblox, Discord and TikTok, she had been interacting with children and adults in the online True Crime Community, or TCC, who glorify mass shooters and encourage violence and self-harm. Seitz said Audree was only 8 years old when she was first exposed to TCC.",
      "\"I think she felt a sense of comfort with this group, with being a part of something, and I believe that they pushed her to do it,\" Seitz said.",
      "Extremism experts classify TCC as a subculture of nihilistic violent extremism, in which participants are not motivated by a particular ideology but instead driven by a generally misanthropic worldview. Some are driven by a desire to achieve notoriety within online communities through violence or self harm, while others target and exploit vulnerable individuals.",
      "The FBI has seen a 300% increase in nihilistic violent extremism cases from September 2024 to September 2025, according to FBI Director Kash Patel. In December, Patel wrote on X that the FBI is pursuing hundreds of nihilistic violent extremism cases, including many from another network called 764.",
      "\"This is one of the most serious issues in America,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "The FBI confirmed to CBS News that it had been in touch with Audree's family, but declined to comment further on her case or answer general inquiries about nihilistic violent extremism.",
      "\"It's something that was so mind blowing \u2014 that it started at such a young age and that she was groomed into this ideology of worshipping school shooters, \" Seitz said. \"It's hard to wrap your head around.\"",
      "What is TCC?",
      "People who identify as being a part of TCC become fascinated with mass killers and develop fan-like behaviors, according to the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that works toward solutions to combat extremism.",
      "While the fixation on high-profile killers predates the internet, the Columbine High School shooting in 1999 ushered in a new era of fandom.",
      "\"We've seen this behavior with respect to serial killers and to mass shooters going back well before Columbine, Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the institute, told CBS News. \"What Columbine did was it gave it a distinct aesthetic.\"",
      "TCC fans substitute aesthetics for ideology, according to researchers \u2014 such as dressing in perpetrators' style and taking up their interests, like favorite songs, rather than adopting their particular motivations.",
      "Online, those active in the TCC share violent \"gore\" videos, create and commission fan art of mass shooters and sometimes interact with people plotting attacks, said David Riedman, an assistant professor at Idaho State University who created a database to track school shootings.",
      "Illustrations, video edits and photo collages romanticizing and sympathizing with perpetrators of the Columbine, Virginia Tech and Sandy Hook school shootings are easy to find in TCC-tagged posts on platforms including Tumblr, TikTok and X. The community is considered niche \u2014 CBS News identified posts on these platforms with \"likes\" ranging in the thousands.",
      "Riedman said few people in TCC circles will actually go on to commit acts of violence. But a small portion do, with devastating consequences.",
      "Seven recent shootings in U.S. K-12 schools have been linked to TCC, according to Riedman's data. Eleven people were killed and 53 more were injured in the attacks, which took place over the last two years. Five of the shooters took their own lives as well.",
      "Just last month, police charged a 17-year-old in Indiana linked to TCC who was allegedly plotting to carry out an attack. A search of her phone revealed a drawing of the Columbine perpetrators and screenshots from a Discord conversation between her and a friend who encouraged her to livestream an attack, an affidavit obtained by CBS News alleged.",
      "When people active in the TCC carry out shootings, they sometimes become new idols within the community and inspire more violence. The 15-year-old girl behind the\u00a0December 2024 shooting that killed a teacher and a student at Abundant Life Christian School in Madison, Wisconsin, is one example.",
      "A month later, a Tennessee teenager she followed on X shot a student in his school and then himself. Posts from an X account believed to be his encouraged her to livestream the Wisconsin attack, CBS News found. In the days after, he posted defending her and calling her a hero.",
      "In August and September, two more individuals linked to TCC, one in Minnesota and another in Colorado, carried out deadly school shootings before killing themselves. The Colorado perpetrator posted on violent gore sites about previous shootings, the Anti-Defamation League found. YouTube videos posted by the Minnesota perpetrator and reviewed by CBS News showed written references to school shooters \u2014 including the name of the Abundant Life perpetrator \u2014 on his weapons and a journal.",
      "The perpetrator behind the Abundant Life shooting \"wanted that notoriety,\" Zoschak said.",
      "\"It was about her,\" he added. While ideologically motivated violence aims to have an effect on society, he said, \"nihilistic violence is about fulfilling an inward-focused need.\"",
      "How children get pulled in",
      "TCC can hold an appeal for young people who are experiencing bullying or feel like they don't identify with other kids, Riedman said.",
      "\"You start to meet people that will like all of your photos and will share your content and are inviting you to come to their private chats,\" Riedman said. \"Now you have this community that you don't have anywhere else.\"",
      "Seitz said she believes Audree may have been drawn to the group for its embrace of kids who feel alienated from their classmates.",
      "\"It was hard for her to find her spot in seventh grade,\" she said.",
      "Seth, 29, was a part of the TCC community and ran a Columbine blog on Tumblr when he was a teenager. He told CBS News he was struggling with mental illness at the time and identified with the perpetrators of school shootings.",
      "\"I was very angry, and so it's like, oh, OK, here are these people who are angry,\" said Seth, who asked that his last name be withheld. \"They're doing something about it.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Tumblr wrote in a statement that the platform \"does not allow content that encourages or incites violence or that glorifies acts of violence or the perpetrators.\"",
      "Seitz wants social media platforms to face accountability. Despite enabling parental controls on Audree's phone, she said, her daughter was steeped in TCC content for years. This fall, she filed suit against Roblox, Discord and TikTok.",
      "The complaint alleges that the apps prioritize user growth over safety and that they are aware that \"the design of their apps makes children easy targets for predatory behavior.\"",
      "In statements to CBS News, spokespeople from each platform wrote that the companies employ technologies to detect harmful content and remove what violates their policies. A Roblox spokesperson said the platform bans \"content or behavior that supports, glorifies, or promotes hate groups, extremist organizations, or their ideologies.\" A Discord spokesperson said \"the actions of extremist groups or extremism behavior have no place on Discord.\"",
      "After CBS News inquired about several TCC-related hashtags, TikTok removed one of them from the platform. A spokesperson also said accounts that promote or glorify violence are taken down and banned.",
      "Seitz said she hadn't heard of TCC before Audree's death, and she never heard her daughter talk about school shooters. But TCC references understood by those in the community can fly under the radar of unknowing parents and peers.",
      "When Seitz searched \"True Crime Community\" on TikTok after Audree's death, drawings she recognized from her daughter flooded the screen.",
      "\"Everything started to click within not even two minutes,\" she said.",
      "She realized cartoon illustrations Audree had drawn depicted the Columbine perpetrators. A previous TikTok username of Audree's had referenced one of them.",
      "There had even been a TCC reference in a T-shirt Audree asked for. The Columbine perpetrators wore T-shirts for a German industrial band. The Wisconsin shooter was pictured in a shirt for the same band, and Audree wanted to wear one too.",
      "After reflecting on the way Audree's phone was positioned when she discovered her after her death, Jaimee also now believes that her daughter was attempting to livestream her suicide \u2014 something Zoschak said he has seen before among TCC fans.",
      "\"Whether you think your child is seemingly happy, you never know,\" Seitz said. \"And that's the scary part of it \u2014 that's what terrifies me the most.\"",
      "A new category of extremism",
      "The misanthropic violence, absent of ideology, exhibited by attackers involved in TCC has been categorized as nihilistic violent extremism \u2014 a term that has increasingly appeared in Justice Department announcements of criminal charges across the country.",
      "Some nihilistic violent extremists carry out violence with the goal of hastening the collapse of society \u2014 a philosophy known as accelerationism.",
      "But for most, experts said, their mindset mostly revolves around nihilism \u2014 the belief that life and society are meaningless and that moral values are baseless.",
      "In recent months, authorities have taken particular note of the nihilistic violent extremist network 764, with more than 300 investigations into the network ongoing, according to the FBI.",
      "Similar to TCC, 764 lacks a specific ideology, but members more openly encourage self-harm and violence than those in TCC do. Perpetrators associated with 764 encourage victims to produce videos documenting acts of self-harm or child sexual abuse material. Last month, lawmakers introduced a bill that would make it a federal crime to coerce children into self-harm.",
      "Nihilistic online communities like TCC and 764 are also often overlapping.",
      "\"They're all aware of each other,\" Zoschak said. \"It's not like these are isolated ecosystems \u2014 they interact with each other.\"",
      "Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, estimates that there are about 10,000 nihilistic violent extremism perpetrators involved in online grooming around the world \u2014 and 100,000 victims. He said these extremist networks are constantly growing as members try to recruit more victims, and the law enforcement response is further complicated by the younger age groups involved.",
      "\"We do not charge 13-year-old children with adult-level crimes on a regular basis,\" Kriner said.",
      "Seth, who left TCC after seeking mental health treatment, said it's important for children who feel drawn to the TCC community as an outlet to know that there are other options.",
      "\"I got really into art after I left the community, I got into writing,\" he said. \"That was a dark period of my life, but it doesn't need to define you.\"",

And so it's just this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.\"",
      "Amid an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on Wednesday shot and killed Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old American citizen. Video of the incident from different vantage points has ricocheted across social media, with Mr. Trump and Vance insisting Good had instigated the shooting, although the footage is unclear whether Good was attempting to drive into the ICE agent or drive away.",

      "In response to Omar's comments on Sunday, a White House spokesperson said \"multiple videos\" contradicted Omar, and insisted the \"ICE officer was clearly struck by Good's car.\"",
      "Minneapolis, which Omar represents in Congress, has been reeling since the shooting, with days of protests. In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey told ICE to \"get the f*** out of Minneapolis,\" and Gov. Tim Walz called the federal agency's narrative of the events \"bulls**t.\" Walz added, \"Don't believe this propaganda machine.\"",
      "Omar said she thinks \"it is really important for Americans to record\" ICE agents and law enforcement at protests to \"create the level of accountability and transparency that we need.\"",
      "\"What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars,\" Omar said. \"These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes, they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes, these people are citizens. Oftentimes, these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.\"",

They have hardly finished anywhere but first in the years since, winning three consecutive world championships and the gold medal at three straight Grand Prix Finals.",
      "U.S. silver medalists Emilea Zingas and Vadym Koklesnik also made the dance team, as did the Canadian-born Christina Carreira and Anthony Ponomarenko, who became eligible for the Olympics in November when her American citizenship came through.",
      "Liu was picked for her second Olympic team after briefly retiring following the Beijing Games. She had been burned out by years of practice and competing, but stepping away seemed to rejuvenate the 20-year-old from Clovis, California, and she returned to win the first world title by an American since Kimmie Meissner stood atop the podium two decades ago.",
      "Now, the avant-garde Liu will be trying to help the U.S. win its first women's medal since Sasha Cohen in Turin in 2006, and perhaps the first gold medal since Sarah Hughes triumphed four years earlier at the Salt Lake City Games.",
      "Her biggest competition, besides a powerful Japanese contingent, could come from her own teammates: Glenn, a first-time Olympian, has been nearly unbeatable the past two years, while 18-year-old Isabeau Levito is a former world silver medalist.",

      "The top American pairs team, two-time reigning U.S. champions Alisa Efimova and Misha Mitrofanov, were hoping that the Finnish-born Efimova would get her citizenship approved in time to compete in Italy. But despite efforts by the Skating Club of Boston, where they train, and the help of their U.S. senators, she did not receive her passport by the selection deadline.",
      "\"The importance and magnitude of selecting an Olympic team is one of the most important milestones in an athlete's life,\" U.S. Figure Skating CEO Matt Farrell said, \"and it has such an impact, and while there are sometimes rules, there is also a human element to this that we really have to take into account as we make decisions and what's best going forward from a selection process.",
      "\"Sometimes these aren't easy,\" Farrell said, \"and this is not the fun part.\"",

      "Nikki Glaser returns as host",
      "Glaser made history last year as the first woman to host the Golden Globes solo. This year, she took it upon herself to hand out an award for Best Editing to the Justice Department during her opening monologue, alluding to the redactions and delayed release of the Epstein files.",
      "\"I cannot believe the amount of star power we have in this room tonight. It's insane,\" Glaser said. \"There are so many A-listers, and by A-list I do mean 'a list that has been heavily redacted.' And the Golden Globe for best editing goes to the Justice Department. Yes. Congratulations.\"",
      "The comedian, who stole the show at 2024's \"The Roast of Tom Brady,\" also cracked jokes about Kevin Hart's height and Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriends, and asked George Clooney to fix her Nespresso machine, poking fun at one of the actor's endorsement deals.",

      "Several stars attended Sunday's award show with pins protesting Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

      "Best original song went to \"Golden\" from \"KPop Demon Hunters.\" Ejae, who wrote the lyrics and provided the singing voice for the film's character Rumi, accepted the award. As a child, she'd trained for years in hopes of becoming a K-pop star, only to face rejection, she said.",
      "\"I leaned on songs and music to get through it,\" Ejae said. \"Now I'm here, as a singer and a songwriter. It's a dream come true to be part of a song that's helping other girls, other boys and everyone from all ages to get through their hardships and accept themselves.\"",

    "story": [
      "Congregants and leaders vowed to rebuild a historic Mississippi synagogue that was heavily damaged by a fire after an individual was taken into custody for what authorities said Sunday was an act of arson.",
      "The fire ripped through the Beth Israel Congregation in Jackson shortly after 3 a.m. on Saturday, authorities said. The synagogue was closed at the time and no congregants were injured in the blaze. The suspect sustained burns that were not life-threatening, the Jackson Fire Department said.",
      "Photos showed the charred remains of an administrative office and synagogue library, where several Torahs were destroyed or damaged.",
      "Authorities have not disclosed the suspect's motive, but Jackson Fire Chief Charles Felton told CBS News the FBI is looking into the possibility of a hate crime. Felton said he couldn't release the suspect's ID yet due to the ongoing investigation.",
      "\"Acts of antisemitism, racism, and religious hatred are attacks on Jackson as a whole and will be treated as acts of terror against residents' safety and freedom to worship,\" Jackson Mayor John Horhn said in a statement. \"Targeting people because of their faith, race, ethnicity, or sexual orientation is morally wrong, un-American, and completely incompatible with the values of this city.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the Jackson FBI told the Associated Press they are \"working with law enforcement partners on this investigation.\"",
      "The synagogue, the largest in Mississippi and the only one in Jackson, was the site of a Ku Klux Klan bombing in 1967 \u2014 a response to the congregation's role in civil rights activities, according to the\u00a0Institute of Southern Jewish Life, which also houses its office in the building.",
      "\"That history reminds us that attacks on houses of worship, whatever their cause, strike at the heart of our shared moral life,\" said CJ Rhodes, a prominent Black Baptist pastor in Jackson, in a Facebook post.",
      "\"This wasn't random vandalism \u2014 it was a deliberate, targeted attack on the Jewish community,\" Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, said in a statement. \"That it has been attacked again, amid a surge of antisemitic incidents across the US, is a stark reminder: antisemitic violence is escalating, and it demands total condemnation and swift action from everyone.\"",
      "The ADL's regional chapter said it was in contact with the Beth Israel Congregation leadership and local leaders to provide support and resources.",
      "\"The fact that this historic synagogue, which was bombed by the Ku Klux Klan in 1967 because of Rabbi Perry Nussbaum's civil rights advocacy, has once again been targeted is particularly painful and disturbing,\" ADL South Central regional director Lindsay Baach Friedmann said in a statement.",
      "The congregation is still assessing the damage and received outreach from other houses of worship, said Michele Schipper, CEO of the Institute of Southern Jewish Life and past president of the congregation. The synagogue will continue its regular worship programs and services for Shabbat, the weekly Jewish Sabbath, likely inside of one of the local churches that reached out.",
      "\"We are devastated but ready to rebuild, and we are so appreciative of the outreach from the community,\" said Schipper.",
      "One Torah that survived the Holocaust was behind glass not damaged in the fire, Schipper said. Five Torahs inside the sanctuary are being assessed for smoke damage. Two Torahs inside the library, where the most severe damage was done, were destroyed, according to a synagogue representative.",
      "The floors, walls and ceiling of the sanctuary were covered in soot, and the synagogue will have to replace upholstery and carpeting.",
      "\"A lot of times we hear things happening throughout the country in other parts, and we feel like this wouldn't happen in our part,\" said chief fire investigator Charles Felton \"A lot of people are in disbelief that this would happen here in Jackson, Mississippi.\"",

      "Trump administration officials are set to meet with Danish officials about Greenland on Wednesday, diplomatic sources tell CBS News.",
      "The meeting, which has not been officially announced, comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress last week that President Trump is interested in purchasing the Danish territory. The White House also said Tuesday officials are discussing a wide range of options\u00a0for acquiring Greenland, including using the U.S. military to take it by force.",
      "While Rubio had downplayed the threat of military force in his remarks to reporters, Mr. Trump doubled down on the possibility again on Sunday night, saying, \"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen.\"",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday aboard Air Force One, echoing his previous statement on Friday when he said, \"if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, who met with Danish officials last week, said on Sunday that he thinks Democrats and Republicans in Congress would unite to stop any military action aimed at taking Greenland. \"We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way,\" he said on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"Either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy,\" the Democrat said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0told the New York Times\u00a0in an interview published last week that ownership of Greenland, the world's largest island, was important because \"that's what I feel is psychologically needed for success.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he feels the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland for defense purposes.",
      "The escalatory language by the president in recent weeks has further stressed already strained relations with European allies. Multiple European diplomats told CBS News that they increasingly understand that America's commitment to the defense of Europe and NATO is no longer as ironclad as it has been over the past decades \u2014 or even the past few years of\u00a0the war in Ukraine, during which the U.S. rallied European countries to unify against Russian aggression. One diplomat told CBS News that the Greenland situation is a potential breaking point.",
      "When asked Sunday whether he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the NATO alliance, Mr. Trump said, \"It would save a lot of money. I like NATO. I just wonder whether or not, if we needed NATO, would they be there for us. I'm not sure they would.\"",
      "Louisiana GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, who Mr. Trump appointed as\u00a0special envoy to Greenland\u00a0last month, wrote Sunday on X that \"History matters. The U.S. defended Greenland's sovereignty during WWII when Denmark couldn't.\"",
      "\"After the war, Denmark re-occupied it\u2014side stepping and ignoring UN protocol. This should be about hospitality, not hostility,\" Landry said.",
      "In response, Denmark's Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen said \"facts matter too,\" and pointed out Greenland \"has been a part of the Kingdom of Denmark for centuries.\" He also emphasized that last week, all five of Greenland's parties in Parliament repeated they\u00a0don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "\"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",

      "The wall text, which summarized Mr. Trump's first presidency and noted his 2024 comeback victory, was part of the museum's \"American Presidents\" exhibition. The description had been placed alongside a photograph of Mr. Trump taken during his first term. Now, a different photo appears without any accompanying text block, though\u00a0the text was available online.\u00a0Mr. Trump was the only president whose display in the gallery, as seen on Sunday, did not include any extended text.",
      "The White House did not say whether it sought any changes. Nor did a Smithsonian statement in response to Associated Press questions. But Mr. Trump ordered in August that Smithsonian officials\u00a0review all exhibits before the nation celebrates the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence on July 4. The Republican administration said the effort would \"ensure alignment with the president's directive to celebrate American exceptionalism, remove divisive or partisan narratives, and restore confidence in our shared cultural institutions.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's original \"portrait label,\" as the Smithsonian calls it, notes Mr. Trump's Supreme Court nominations and his administration's development of COVID-19 vaccines. That section concludes: \"Impeached twice, on charges of abuse of power and incitement of insurrection after supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, he was acquitted by the Senate in both trials.\"",
      "Then the text continues: \"After losing to Joe Biden in 2020, Trump mounted a historic comeback in the 2024 election. He is the only president aside from Grover Cleveland (1837\u2013 1908) to have won a nonconsecutive second term.\"",
      "Asked about the display, White House spokesman Davis Ingle celebrated the new photograph, which shows Mr. Trump, brow furrowed, leaning over his Oval Office desk. Ingle said it ensures Mr. Trump's \"unmatched aura ... will be felt throughout the halls of the National Portrait Gallery.\"",
      "The portrait was taken by White House photographer Daniel Torok, who is credited in the display that includes medallions noting Mr. Trump is the 45th and 47th president. Similar numerical medallions appear alongside other presidents' painted portraits that also include the more extended biographical summaries, such as what had been part of Mr. Trump's display.",
      "Sitting presidents are represented by photographs until their official paintings are commissioned and completed.",
      "Ingle did not answer questions about whether Mr. Trump or a White House aide, on his behalf, asked for anything related to the portrait label.",
      "The gallery said in a statement that it had previously rotated two photographs of Mr. Trump from its collection before putting up Torok's work.",
      "\"The museum is beginning its planned update of the America's Presidents gallery which will undergo a larger refresh this Spring,\" the gallery statement said. \"For some new exhibitions and displays, the museum has been exploring quotes or tombstone labels, which provide only general information, such as the artist's name.\"",
      "For now, references to Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton being impeached in 1868 and 1998, respectively, remain as part of their portrait labels, as does President Richard Nixon's 1974 resignation as a result of the Watergate scandal.",
      "And, the gallery statement noted, \"The history of Presidential impeachments continues to be represented in our museums, including the National Museum of American History.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has made clear his intentions to shape how the federal government documents U.S. history and culture. He has offered an especially harsh assessment of how the Smithsonian and other museums have featured chattel slavery as a seminal variable in the nation's development but also taken steps to\u00a0reshape how he and his contemporary rivals are depicted.",
      "In the months before his order for a Smithsonian review, he fired the head archivist of the National Archives and said he was firing the National Portrait Gallery's director, Kim Sajet, as part of his overhaul. Sajet maintained the backing of the Smithsonian's governing board, but she ultimately resigned.",
      "At the White House, Mr. Trump has designed a notably partisan and subjective \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" featuring gilded photographs of himself and his predecessors \u2014 except Biden, who is represented by an autopen \u2014 along with plaques describing their presidencies.",
      "The White House said at the time that Mr. Trump himself was a primary author of the plaques. Notably, Mr. Trump's two plaques praise the 45th and 47th president as a historically successful figure, while those under Biden's autopen stand-in describe the 46th executive as \"by far, the worst President in American History\" who \"brought our Nation to the brink of destruction.\"",

    "story": [
      "Bob Weir, a founding member of the legendary rock band the Grateful Dead, has died at the age of 78, his family announced Saturday.",
      "\"It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of Bobby Weir,\" his family wrote in a post to his Instagram page. \"He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could. Unfortunately, he succumbed to underlying lung issues.\"",
      "In the statement, the family disclosed that Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July.",
      "\"As we remember Bobby, it's hard not to feel the echo of the way he lived,\" his family wrote. \"A man driftin' and dreamin', never worrying if the road would lead him home. A child of countless trees. A child of boundless seas.\"",
      "Weir formed the Grateful Dead with Jerry Garcia after the two met in 1963 as teens in Palo Alto, California. The band, with its unique mix of blues, folk and jazz, became a touring powerhouse for decades until Garcia's death in 1995.",
      "Weir wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \"Sugar Magnolia,\" \"One More Saturday Night\" and \"Mexicali Blues.\"",
      "The group eventually reformed a few years after Garcia's death and took many iterations over the years, the latest as Dead & Company.",
      "\"For over sixty years, Bobby took to the road,\" his family's statement said. \"A guitarist, vocalist, storyteller, and founding member of the Grateful Dead. Bobby will forever be a guiding force whose unique artistry reshaped American music. His work did more than fill rooms with music; it was warm sunlight that filled the soul, building a community, a language, and a feeling of family that generations of fans carry with them.\"",
      "Weir's death leaves drummer Bill Kreutzmann as the only surviving original member. Founding bassist Phil Lesh died in 2024. The band's other drummer, Mickey Hart, practically an original member since joining in 1967, is also alive at 82. The fifth founding member, Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan, died in 1973.",
      "Dead and Company played a series of concert's for the Grateful Dead's 60th anniversary in July at Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.",
      "Born in San Francisco and raised in nearby Atherton, Weir was the Dead's youngest member and looked like a fresh-faced high-schooler in its early years. He was generally less shaggy than the rest of the band, but had a long beard like Garcia's in later years.",
      "The band would survive long past the hippie moment of its birth, with its ultra-devoted fans known as Deadheads often following them on the road in a virtually non-stop tour that persisted despite decades of music and culture shifting around them.",
      "\"Longevity was never a major concern of ours,\" Weir said when the Dead got the Grammys' Musicares Person of the Year honor last year. \"Spreading joy through the music was all we ever really had in mind and we got plenty of that done.\"",
      "Ubiquitous bumper stickers and T-shirts showed the band's skull logo, the dancing, colored bears that served as their other symbol, and signature phrases like \"ain't no time to hate\" and \"not all who wander are lost.\"",
      "The Dead won few actual Grammys during their career \u2014 they were always a little too esoteric \u2014 getting only a lifetime achievement award in 2007 and the best music film award in 2018.",
      "Just as rare were hit pop singles. \"Touch of Grey,\" the 1987 song that brought a big surge in the aging band's popularity, was their only Billboard Top 10 hit.",
      "But in 2024, they set a record for all artists with their 59th album in Billboard's Top 40. Forty-one of those came since 2012, thanks to the popularity of the series of archival albums compiled by David Lemieux.",
      "Their music \u2014 called acid rock at its inception \u2014 would pull in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams at their concerts.",
      "\"I venture to say they are the great American band,\" TV personality and devoted Deadhead Andy Cohen said as host of the MusiCares event. \"What a wonder they are.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump disclosed U.S. jobs data the day before the Department of Labor released\u00a0hiring numbers for December, a closely watched economic report on Wall Street that can sway financial markets.",
      "At 8:20 p.m. EST on Thursday, Mr. Trump\u00a0posted a graph depicting changes in private and government employment since January 2025. When the full jobs report was released Friday morning, it became clear that Mr. Trump's post had incorporated the December employment data because the totals in the chart matched figures released in the monthly report.",
      "Mr. Trump brushed off the incident. \"I don't know if they posted them,\" he told reporters Friday afternoon. \"They gave me some numbers. When people give me things, I post them.\"",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump's post came after he was briefed on the employment numbers, calling it an \"inadvertent public disclosure of aggregate data that was partially derived from pre-released information.\"",
      "The White House is now reviewing its protocols for economic data releases, the official added.",
      "Cooler hiring",
      "The government's latest jobs report shows that hiring cooled in December, with employers adding 50,000 jobs, while the nation's unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%. The economy added roughly 584,000 jobs for all of 2025, down from more than 2 million in 2024, labor data shows.",
      "Federal economic data is held under strict embargo until its scheduled release because the information has the potential to move financial markets. Providing some investors with access to such data could allow them to place trades based on knowledge unavailable to other investors.",
      "White House economic officials are provided with an advance copy of the Labor Department's employment report each month on Thursday afternoon and sign agreements to keep the numbers confidential, though they also write up a summary for the president, according to the Associated Press.",

      "\"Markets don't react kindly to that, because obviously it means that perhaps a select few may have been able to front-run on that news ahead of the market at large,\" he said.",
      "Erica Groshen, a former commissioner at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unit that compiles the monthly employment figures, said that premature disclosures of the agency's data can be punished by fines and even jail time. But previous breaches typically have been met with a slap on the wrist, she noted.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Mr. Trump's inadvertent data release.",
      "No market disruption",
      "Although some investors could have acted on the information Mr. Trump posted on Thursday, there were no evident signs of a change in trading or market prices related to the jobs data, said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser Vital Knowledge.",

      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that Iranian officials had called him looking \"to negotiate\" after his repeated threats to intervene if authorities kill protesters. In an unusual move, meanwhile, Iran's state-controlled media aired video on Sunday showing mass casualties in and outside a morgue in a Tehran suburb.",
      "The video shared widely online shows dozens of bodies outside the morgue, which CBS News has geolocated to the southern Tehran suburb of Kahrizak. The bodies were wrapped in black bags, and people can be seen grieving and searching for their loved ones at the site.",
      "The state TV reporter says in the clip that some of those seen dead may have been involved in violence, but that \"the majority of them are ordinary people, and their families are ordinary people as well.\"",
      "Video posted by social media users on Sunday showed scenes from the same morgue, and people could be heard wailing in the background as others appeared to be looking for loved ones amid the bodies.",
      "It is unclear why Iranian authorities might have chosen to show the mass casualties, but it could be an attempt to show sympathy with the protesters and to bolster their narrative that it is more radical actors, inspired by Mr. Trump's messages of support, behind the violence, not the government.",

      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Sunday that the president had been briefed on new options for military strikes in Iran, after Mr. Trump warned that if the regime started \"killing people like they have in the past, we would get involved.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 08:12:07 -0500",
    "summary": "Many Iranian opposition activists are hoping the current unrest could be the beginning of the end of the country's hardline Islamic regime.",
    "story": [
      "Iran has faced intense nationwide protests for more than\u00a0two weeks, marking the largest challenge to the country's ruling regime in years \u2014 and drawing vows from President Trump to intervene on the protesters' behalf if they face a violent crackdown.",
      "Initially sparked by Iran's economic freefall and severe inflation, the protests have boiled over, with about 185 cities facing demonstrations. One monitoring group has reported thousands of arrests and more than 500 deaths since the protests began.",
      "Here's what you need to know:",
      "How the Iran protests started, and what they've become",
      "The current wave of protests began in the capital, Tehran, in late December as shopkeepers went on strike and marched into the streets. Small business owners in Iran have long been seen as supportive of the regime, but anger over spiraling inflation and the devaluation of the nation's currency, which lost more than 40% of its value last year, making everyday goods impossible for many people to afford, sparked the demonstrations.",
      "The protests quickly spread, with people joining marches across the country to denounce not only the economic woes, but to air wider discontent with the country's hardline regime.",
      "As of Saturday, protests were reported in at least 185 cities in all 31 of the country's provinces, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, or HRANA, a U.S.-based monitoring group founded by anti-regime activists.",
      "Demonstrations have also been reported on dozens of university campuses since late December, and strikes and shop closures were reported in markets in over a dozen cities, HRANA said.",
      "Videos posted on social media virtually every night have shown crowds of protesters marching through the streets of various Iranian cities, chanting anti-government slogans and clashing with the country's security forces in some cases.",
      "How Iranian authorities have responded",
      "Thousands of people have been reported detained since the wave of protests began,\u00a0according to HRANA. More than 500 people have been killed, the group said Sunday, Jan. 11 \u2014 mostly protesters, but also more than 40 members of the security services.",
      "The group found that many victims \"were killed by live ammunition or pellet gunfire, predominantly from close range.\"",
      "Iran's attorney general on Jan. 10 warned that anyone taking part in the protests would be considered an \"enemy of God,\" according to The Associated Press \u2014 a death-penalty charge.",
      "The Islamic Republic's semiofficial Fars news agency had\u00a0claimed on Jan. 5\u00a0that about 250 police officers and 45 members of the feared Basij security force had been injured amid the unrest.",
      "Iranian authorities cut off phone service and web access beginning Jan. 8\u00a0across the country, according to the internet monitoring organization NetBlocks, which said a \"nationwide internet blackout\" continued into Jan. 11, writing on social media that \"national connectivity levels continue to flatline around 1% of ordinary levels.\"",
      "\"Even Starlink, which has been the main line of communication for some activists in different parts of the country, has been jammed,\" Maziar Bahari, editor of the independent IranWire news site, told CBS News on Friday, referring to the satellite communication system run by Elon Musk.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from SpaceX, which runs Starlink, but did not get any immediate response.",
      "Trump warns he'll hit Iran \"very hard\" if it kills protesters",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened on several occasions since the protests began that he could order a U.S. intervention if Iranian authorities kill demonstrators.",
      "\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!,\" the president wrote on Truth Social on Jan. 10.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Jan. 9, Mr. Trump reiterated that he was open to some kind of U.S. action, although he said that would not involve a U.S. incursion.",
      "\"I've made the statement very strongly that if they start killing people like they have in the past, we will get involved,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We'll be hitting them very hard where it hurts. And that doesn't mean boots on the ground, but it means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts. So, we don't want that to happen.\"",
      "In a Jan. 2 post on Truth Social, he said: \"If Iran [shoots] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue. We are locked and loaded and ready to go.\"",
      "Speaking on Fox News on Jan. 8, Mr. Trump said the U.S. was \"ready\" to hit Iran hard if protesters were killed, but added, \"for the most part, they haven't\" been.",
      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News on Jan. 11 that Mr. Trump has been briefed on new options for potential military strikes.",
      "The president's comments came just over six months after he ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, amid a deadly days-long conflict between Iran and Israel.",
      "The unrest in Iran also comes as Mr. Trump takes a more aggressive posture on the world stage. U.S. forces captured former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in an overnight military operation in Caracas on Jan. 3, and Mr. Trump has suggested he's open to military action in Colombia to combat drug trafficking, and even to take control of Greenland.",
      "Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who studies Iran, told CBS News last week that Mr. Trump's gestures of support could embolden Iranian protesters, saying his comments may be the \"one ingredient you need to keep \u2026 the street-level movement alive.\"",
      "Bahari, of IranWire, said Iranian officials had told him they were concerned about Mr. Trump potentially intervening in Iran even before the protests began.",
      "The recent U.S. attack on Venezuela, \"has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protesters. But at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause.\"",
      "Iranian leaders acknowledge problems, but blame U.S.",
      "In an address on state television aired Friday, after an intense night of protests, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed that his regime would \"not back down,\" called for unity and accused \"a bunch of vandals\" in Tehran of causing chaos in the capital \"to please the U.S. president.\"",
      "In some cases, Iranian officials have attempted to strike a conciliatory tone, acknowledging people's economic concerns and insisting that people have the right to protest peacefully. State media reported that President Masoud Pezeshkian had directed security forces not to crack down on peaceful protesters.",
      "The government has also offered some relief in the form of $7-a-month stipends that can be used in grocery stores to buy basic necessities.",
      "Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has condemned Mr. Trump threats of a U.S. intervention, accusing the U.S. of \"inciting violence and terrorism.\"",
      "Iranian army commander Major General Amir Hatami threatened Wednesday to \"cut off the hand of any aggressor.\"",
      "Iran's history of mass protests",
      "Protests \u2014 and severe crackdowns \u2014 are a recurring theme in Iran.",
      "The last major round of protests came in 2022, spurred by the death in police custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the theocratic government's forces for allegedly wearing her headscarf incorrectly. Hundreds of people were killed across months of demonstrations.",
      "Other protest movements came in 2019 and 2017, and Iran was beset by a large-scale uprising in 2009 over the country's contested presidential election.",
      "\"From what we saw on social media channels and also from conversations with different people in Iran, the number of protesters in different parts of the country is not as high as in 2022, but there are more protests \u2014   the protests are more widespread in different parts of the country,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"So, even some smaller cities where they never had a protest in those cities, they see protests these days, and I think people are more desperate than before.\"",
      "The current protests seem different compared to the previous rounds \u2014   and could be harder for the regime to quell by offering concessions \u2014 due to their roots in the country's economic woes, according to Mona Yacoubian, Director and Senior Adviser of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "She noted that in 2022, the regime was able to appease protesters by \"simply addressing their complaints about women's veiling and so forth.\"",
      "But the protesters now are more focused on economic problems, and \"there's really nothing [the regime] can do\" to get Iran's moribund economy back on track, she said.",
      "\"These protests, they are about economic situation, but also about dignity,\" Bahari told CBS News. \"It's about the national pride. And because of that, this protest will be very, very difficult to contain.\"",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi cheers on the protests",
      "Iranian Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, whose father the former shah, fled just before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that brought the current clerical regime to power, has cheered the protests from exile, urging demonstrators this week to keep the movement \"disciplined\" and \"as large as possible.\"",
      "The crown prince called for Iranians to chant together against the country's leadership at 8 p.m. local time, or 12 p.m. Eastern, on Jan. 8 and Jan. 9, and many did seem to answer his call.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in a video message on Jan. 9.",
      "Pahlavi's call to action \"could be a turning point\" in the protest movement, Yacoubian told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"This is a regime that is not afraid to use lethal force,\" Yacoubian said. \"But the question is, to what extent, if they become overwhelmed, if the protests become overwhelmingly large and if there are elements in security forces, police, and so forth, kind of at that local level, who themselves are suffering the effects of this economic crisis and who decide not to shoot at people: These are the kinds of questions I think that we need to watch.\"",

At least 538 people have died in violence surrounding the demonstrations, U.S.-based activists said, with fears the death toll is far higher. More than 10,600 people have been arrested, the Human Rights Activists News Agency said.",
      "The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. officials, first reported Saturday night that Mr. Trump had been given military options but hadn't made a final decision. The WSJ reports that Trump will receive further options on Tuesday.",
      "The U.S. has not moved any forces in preparation for potential military strikes.",
      "America has many capabilities and options, and cyber attacks could be among them, according to a U.S. official who also confirmed that the Trump administration approves of Elon Musk's decision to make Starlink terminals available in Iran. That satellite-based internet service could help protestors bypass government restrictions amid the ongoing communications blackout. Starlink did not respond to CBS inquiries.",
      "The U.S. already has heavy sanctions on Iran's regime, and in recent weeks has added to them. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that Mr. Trump has \"moral support\" for actions in Iran. He declined to answer a question about whether the U.S. would interdict vessels carrying Iranian oil for trading on the black market.",
      "\"I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back,\" Wright said.",
      "Iran's theocratic rulers continue to claim that the protesters are agitators influenced by the U.S. and Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke Saturday about the protests and other regional issues, according to US officials.",
      "Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, Iran's parliament speaker and a hardliner who has run for the presidency in the past, warned Sunday that the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if the U.S. strikes the Islamic Republic.",
      "\"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" Qalibaf said, according to the Associated Press. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"",
      "On Friday, Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, said on X: \"Our enemies don't know Iran. In the past, the US failed due to their flawed planning. Today too, their flawed scheming will cause them to fail.\"",
      "There are currently 2,000 U.S. troops next door in Iraq, stationed on bases that have previously been targeted by Iranian-backed militias. There are also U.S. forces throughout the Mideast region, including significant hubs in Qatar, home of U.S. Central Command, and Bahrain, where the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet is stationed.",
      "Back in June, Iran launched a missile strike on the Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in retaliation for the U.S. airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who is on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, said on \"Face the Nation\" that U.S. military action in Iran now to help the protesters would be a \"massive mistake.\"",
      "\"It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up,\" Kaine said. \"Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country.\"",
      "Kaine called for maintaining the sanctions pressure, noting that it had been successful against the Assad regime in Syria. Last December, armed rebels previously aligned with terror groups finally ousted Assad from power after a 14 year civil war.",
      "\"U.S. military action would bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States,\" he added.",
      "When asked on Sunday if shooting protesters would be the \"red line\" for Mr. Trump that would trigger U.S. action, a senior U.S. official declined to explicitly confirm it, saying \"only Trump can determine what the red line is.\"",
      "The White House and U.S. State Department have declined to answer questions about specific military options being considered.",

      "Faced with its most significant challenge in years, Iran's theocratic rulers have issued increasingly stern threats to what it claims are agitators being influenced by the U.S. and Israel \u2014 and answered threats of a U.S. intervention by President Trump with corresponding threats of their own.",
      "Iran's parliament speaker warned the U.S. military and Israel would be \"legitimate targets\" if America strikes the Islamic Republic, as threatened by Mr. Trump. Qalibaf made the threat as lawmakers rushed the dais in the Iranian parliament, shouting: \"Death to America!\"",
      "Those abroad fear the information blackout will embolden hard-liners within Iran's security services to launch a bloody crackdown, despite warnings from Mr. Trump that he's willing to strike the Islamic Republic if demonstrators are killed.",
      "On Saturday afternoon, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that \"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!\"",
      "\"I'm sure that has really scared many Iranian officials and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protestors, but at the same time, it has inspired many protesters to come out because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause,\" Maziar Bahari, the editor of the IranWire news website told CBS News.",
      "A senior U.S. official confirmed to CBS News that Mr. Trump has been briefed on new options for potential military strikes in Iran. The New York Times and Wall Street Journal, citing anonymous U.S. officials, reported Saturday night that Mr. Trump had been given military options but hadn't made a final decision.",
      "Iran lawmaker says \"signs of a threat\" could trigger attacks on U.S. troops",
      "Iranian state television broadcast the Sunday parliament session live. Qalibaf, a hard-liner who has run for the presidency in the past, gave a speech applauding police and Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, particularly its all-volunteer Basij, for having \"stood firm\" during the protests.",
      "\"The people of Iran should know that we will deal with them in the most severe way and punish those who are arrested,\" Qalibaf said.",
      "He went on to directly threaten Israel, \"the occupied territory\" as he referred to it, and the U.S. military, possibly with a preemptive strike.",
      "\"In the event of an attack on Iran, both the occupied territory and all American military centers, bases and ships in the region will be our legitimate targets,\" Qalibaf said. \"We do not consider ourselves limited to reacting after the action and will act based on any objective signs of a threat.\"",
      "It remains unclear just how serious Iran is about launching a strike, particularly after seeing its air defenses destroyed during the 12-day war in June with Israel, which also saw the U.S. carry out strikes against its nuclear facilities. Any decision to go to war would rest with Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The U.S. military has said in the Mideast it is \"postured with forces that span the full range of combat capability to defend our forces, our partners and allies and U.S. interests.\"",
      "Israel, meanwhile, is \"watching closely\" the situation between the U.S. and Iran, said an Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to not being authorized to speak to journalists. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio overnight on topics including Iran, the official added.",
      "Iran targeted U.S. forces at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar back in June, while the U.S. Navy's Mideast-based 5th Fleet is stationed in the island kingdom of Bahrain.",
      "Iran threatens protesters with death sentences",
      "Online videos sent out of Iran, likely using Starlink satellite transmitters, purportedly showed gathering in northern Tehran's Punak neighborhood. There, it appeared authorities shut off streets, with protesters waving their lit mobile phones. Others banged metal while fireworks went off.",
      "Other video purportedly showed demonstrators peacefully marching down a street and others honking their car horns on the street.",
      "\"The pattern of protests in the capital has largely taken the form of scattered, short-lived, and fluid gatherings, an approach shaped in response to the heavy presence of security forces and increased field pressure,\" the Human Rights Activists News Agency said. \"At the same time, reports were received of surveillance drones flying overhead and movements by security forces around protest locations, indicating ongoing monitoring and security control.\"",
      "In Mashhad, Iran's second-largest city, some 450 miles northeast of Tehran, video purported to show protesters confronting security forces. Flaming debris and dumpsters could be seen in the street, blocking the road. Mashhad is home to the Imam Reza shrine, the holiest in Shiite Islam, making the protests there carry heavy significance for the country's theocracy.",
      "Protests also appeared to happen in Kerman, 500 miles southeast of Tehran.",
      "Iranian state television on Sunday morning took a page from demonstrators, having their correspondents appear on streets in several cities to show calm areas with a date stamp shown on screen. Tehran and Mashhad were not included. They also showed pro-government demonstrations in Qom and Qazvin.",
      "Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite U.S. warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with Iran's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an \"enemy of God,\" a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who \"helped rioters\" would face the charge.",
      "Iran's theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.",
      "Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, who called for protests Thursday and Friday, asked in his latest message for demonstrators to take to the streets Saturday and Sunday. He urged protesters to carry Iran's old lion-and-sun flag and other national symbols used during the time of the shah to \"claim public spaces as your own.\"",
      "Pahlavi's support of and from Israel has drawn criticism in the past \u2014 particularly after the 12-day war. Demonstrators have shouted in support of the shah in some protests, but it isn't clear whether that's support for Pahlavi himself or a desire to return to a time before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "The demonstrations began Dec. 28 over the collapse of the Iranian rial currency, which trades at over 1.4 million to $1, as the country's economy is squeezed by international sanctions in part levied over its nuclear program. The protests intensified and grew into calls directly challenging Iran's theocracy.",

      "\"My thoughts turn to what is happening these days in the Middle East, particularly in Iran and Syria, where persistent tensions are causing the deaths of many people,\" the U.S.-born pontiff said during his weekly Angelus prayer at the Vatican. \"I hope and pray for the patient cultivation of dialogue and peace, for the common good of society as a whole.\"",

    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials are set to meet with Danish officials about Greenland on Wednesday, diplomatic sources tell CBS News.",
      "The meeting, which has not been officially announced, comes after Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Congress last week that President Trump is interested in purchasing the Danish territory. The White House also said Tuesday officials are discussing a wide range of options\u00a0for acquiring Greenland, including using the U.S. military to take it by force.",
      "While Rubio had downplayed the threat of military force in his remarks to reporters, Mr. Trump doubled down on the possibility again on Sunday night, saying, \"If we don't take Greenland, Russia or China will take Greenland, and I am not going to let that happen.\"",
      "\"I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland,\" Mr. Trump said Sunday aboard Air Force One, echoing his previous statement on Friday when he said, \"if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, who met with Danish officials last week, said on Sunday that he thinks Democrats and Republicans in Congress would unite to stop any military action aimed at taking Greenland. \"We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way,\" he said on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"Either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy,\" the Democrat said.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0told the New York Times\u00a0in an interview published last week that ownership of Greenland, the world's largest island, was important because \"that's what I feel is psychologically needed for success.\" Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he feels the U.S. needs to acquire Greenland for defense purposes.",
      "The escalatory language by the president in recent weeks has further stressed already strained relations with European allies. Multiple European diplomats told CBS News that they increasingly understand that America's commitment to the defense of Europe and NATO is no longer as ironclad as it has been over the past decades \u2014 or even the past few years of\u00a0the war in Ukraine, during which the U.S. rallied European countries to unify against Russian aggression. One diplomat told CBS News that the Greenland situation is a potential breaking point.",
      "When asked Sunday whether he would consider pulling the U.S. out of the NATO alliance, Mr. Trump said, \"It would save a lot of money. I like NATO. I just wonder whether or not, if we needed NATO, would they be there for us. I'm not sure they would.\"",
      "Louisiana GOP Gov. Jeff Landry, who Mr. Trump appointed as\u00a0special envoy to Greenland\u00a0last month, wrote Sunday on X that \"History matters. The U.S. defended Greenland's sovereignty during WWII when Denmark couldn't.\"",
      "\"After the war, Denmark re-occupied it\u2014side stepping and ignoring UN protocol. This should be about hospitality, not hostility,\" Landry said.",
      "In response, Denmark's Ambassador to the U.S. Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen said \"facts matter too,\" and pointed out Greenland \"has been a part of the Kingdom of Denmark for centuries.\" He also emphasized that last week, all five of Greenland's parties in Parliament repeated they\u00a0don't want to become part of the U.S.",
      "\"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders,\" Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen\u00a0said earlier this month that an American military move to seize control of Greenland would amount to the end of the NATO military alliance. Denmark is a NATO member, and NATO's Article 5 states that if a NATO ally suffers an armed attack, all members will consider it an attack on them as well and do what they need to aid the attacked nation.",
      "\"This would be disastrous,\" Kaine said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar, Republican of Florida, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Florida Republican congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar, who joins us this morning from Miami. Congresswoman, welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "REP. MAR\u00cdA ELVIRA SALAZAR: Thank you for the opportunity.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are one of Maria Corina Machado's top allies in Congress. You've said she is coming to Washington this week. President Trump said maybe Tuesday, maybe Wednesday. Details still being worked out. Why is it important for her to get in front of the President of the United States, who is backing Maduro's number two as the current president of that country?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Okay, well, I don't think that the President is really backing anyone that is related to the Maduro regime. But concentrating on Maria Corina Machado, she earned it. She was the one who put together this- she proved to the international community that they, the opposition forces, had won the election. She was able to somehow create the tallies and prove to the Trump administration that they had won by 70 to 30. Remember that Maduro did not give her the opportunity to be the Presidential nominee because he did not like her, because he knew that he was going to lose against her. So she has earned it, and I am sure that she will have a very good, long, solid conversation with the President. She knows the story better than anybody. I was in touch with her during the 16 months that she was hiding in a tunnel because the Maduro forces were looking for her to kill her. So, she's earned it. So, I think we are going to welcome her in Congress, and I'm sure that President Trump is going to be highly, highly pleased with that meeting.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You heard the Energy Secretary here say it could be- it could be years before we get to a transition. The President did say democracy is something he hopes for in Venezuela. Does that mean that she should go back, that the United States should guarantee Maria Corina Machado's security to return? I mean, how can the opposition go back for an election right now?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, you know, she was planning to go when we met in Oslo, when she received the Nobel Peace Prize, she was saying to everybody that she was ready to go back, when on January 3, we took Maduro out. They- I love what Secretary Rubio is expressing and the plan that we have as the country of stabilize, recover, and transition. I think that if you think about it, the Trump administration is creating a blueprint, a new ground breaking, new model for foreign policy, when he- vis-a-vis the western hemisphere. So Maria Corina and the opposition forces fall in that three-planned layout that we have, that Rubio has created and Trump has blessed. So she is part of the transition, and I am sure that they will be able to reorganize themselves. She has hundreds of thousands of people in Caracas and in Venezuela that will help us to put together this electoral system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I know that you support the Trump administration's policy, but Secretary of State Rubio really, really bristled when I asked him why they didn't arrest the Minister of the Interior, Diosdado Cabello, who remains in power. You have been very, very clear in your statements that you think the United States should arrest him. We went back and looked, CBS Miami's Jim DeFede reported in 2017 that Caballo had tried to assassinate Senator Rubio. Can you help people understand why perhaps people in Florida should be concerned or other Americans about this man remaining in control of security forces?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, you know, I know that just Diosdado is probably worse than Maduro and worse than Delcy. They're all Alibaba and the 40 Thieves. Let's- don't make any- let's make sure, for your international audience, that- but- but I am very reassured the fact that we have taken the oil and the resources away from them. That Diosdado Cabello, who is a thief, I repeat, does not want to fall into where Maduro has fallen into, and they will cooperate. And somehow, because we have created this new type of model, that they will work with us, they do not have their resources now they know that we're going to go into this recovery, and that- and that somehow they are going to definitely participate and work with the American forces. They know better. And like I said, this is impressive what's happening, because we have not seen this before in 250 years of history. And Diosdado, I repeat, is definitely someone who was indicted. And one of the source- I have some sources that say that, that we were not able to locate him, but it did- at this hour, I would say that, that everything is really falling into place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he controls the prisons, and there are at least five Americans in those prisons--",
      "REP. SALAZAR: -- With Delcy. With Delcy. Delcy is the one who is really in charge of the secret police and the repressive apparatus. And Diosdado Cabello was in charge of the military, who was part of the Sun's cartel along with Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you know why the Trump administration isn't publicly demanding the release of the Americans that are being held?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Listen, maybe- maybe we do not know some things that are happening, and Rubio said it the other day. I do understand, and I am sure, Rubio knows the area very well, and he knows who the characters are. And we are definitely taking this with- with solid in- a solid- with solid steps. We do not want to make any mistakes and- and I am sure that the political prisoners will be coming out and that we- that we're not giving them, meaning Diosdado and Delcy, any type of- of leeway for them to really run the country. We will see. Like it happened- it happened two, three weeks ago. Let's give them a little bit more time before we see more results.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, the President tweeted today, Cuba gets no more money, no more oil. The CIA assessment is that that regime in Havana is not necessarily in peril, even though the President's saying they are. What are you hearing?",
      "REP. SALAZAR: Well, look, I represent the city of Miami, you know, the heart of the Cuban exile community. And those words are like, magical. It's been 65 years. You know, Cuba is- is really a center of power for our enemies, Iran, Russia, China. And- and now I think they are- they are getting the memo. And Cuba, it's- it's hanging by your threat, by a thread I should say. The threat that Cuba has represented to the United States has been immense. They have no water, they have no electricity, they have no food. They have nothing. So if you think that Maduro was weak. Cuba is even weaker, and now they do not have one drop of oil coming from Venezuela. So that could be the beginning of the end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Mexico is stepping up and providing them some. We're going to have to watch--",
      "REP. SALAZAR: -- And that is a very big mistake. A very big mistake from Madame Sheibaum--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- what happens next. \u00a0 All right. Thank you very much, Congresswoman. We'll be back in a moment.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Richmond, Virginia, where we find Senator Tim Kaine, who has oversight in foreign relations and other key committees. Senator, we know the president has been briefed on military options, but our reporting is no decision made, no military assets put in place to execute anything yet. There aren't even any aircraft carriers in the Mideast region at this moment in time, would you support military action?",
      "SENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, U.S. military action in Iran would be a massive mistake. It would have the effect of giving the Iranian regime the ability to say it's the U.S. that's screwing our country up. Right now, Iranians are blaming, appropriately, the regime for screwing up the country. This Iranian regime has spent years focusing outside its borders on fomenting terrorism and aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza, instead of listening to the needs of its own citizens, and much like Syrian citizens, finally threw off the yoke of Bashar al-Assad and that brutal regime without U.S. military intervention, it looks to be that Iran is doing the same. So let's celebrate their freedom loving spirit. Let's keep up the sanctions pressure, which helped in Syria and is helping, I think, dramatize the- the misdeeds of this regime. But U.S. military action would just bring back the painful history of the U.S. toppling the Iranian prime minister back in the 1950s and would give the regime the ability to blame their own failures on the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You mentioned Syria there. There was some, you know, covert U.S. support. There was something in the beginning, at least with that kind of uprising, would you support any kind of help? I mean, the president saying we're going to help the protesters. What does that mean? Or what should it look like?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Well, I think again, let's use sanctions. In Syria, the Caesar sanctions that we put in place in 2019 to punish Bashar al-Assad for war crimes had a real effect on the Syrian energy, construction and other sectors. And when Syria chose to go a new path, President Trump, with the support of a bipartisan Congress, has reduced those sanctions to open up a new chapter in life for Syria. That's the right answer, but military action, we did not take military action against Bashar al-Assad. We have been engaged militarily in Syria to fight ISIS, because ISIS was part of al-Qaeda, there's a Military Authorization for Use of U.S. Force against ISIS. We've worked with other nations to reduce them, but we didn't use military action against Bashar al-Assad. And we shouldn't use military action against the Iranian government in this- in this protest moment, let's support these brave freedom fighters in other ways, through sanctions, but not use our sons and daughters in the military to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just very quickly, when you mentioned there was authorization for force in Syria and ISIS, I assume that means you support the military strikes that took place yesterday against 35 targets in Syria. This was in response to the killing of those two U.S. soldiers and an American interpreter. That's valid, in your view?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Yeah, yeah, it is legally valid that it has long been held that the 2001 congressional authorization against al-Qaeda includes the ability to go against groups that have come out of or have affiliated with al-Qaeda that mean harm to the U.S. troops. And in this instance, ISIS is still a threat to U.S. troops. There is a legal authorization for the U.S. of force, which is what makes this so different than the use of the military force against Venezuela or Greenland or Cuba or wherever the president wants to take us to war next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you're taking me to the next topic, which is this effort you led. You got about five Republican senators to join your effort in this procedural vote to restrict the president's actions, he would require new congressional approval before new military action in Venezuela. Do you think the Republicans who were with you on this vote will stay with you, given that the president has openly threatened them?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think they will, and I think more may join. The five republicans who voted with me, let's be clear what they were voting for. The Trump administration has waged war, first against Venezuelan boats in international waters, then covert action in Venezuela, and now an attack on Venezuela to depose its leadership, to establish a new government that we chose, not that the Venezuelan people chose, to seize Venezuela's economy and even say we're going to set the terms of economic and political transition for the next few years. What my Republican colleagues voted for is, let's get this out of the classified and put it before the American public and actually debate this use of the U.S. military on the floor of the United States Senate. Four months into it, hundreds of Venezuelans dead, American troops injured, let's finally debate this publicly. That's all they voted for, and the fact that the president is going against them just for wanting to have this debate before the public, shows how nervous the president is about both his legal authority, but also the wisdom of what he's doing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, he said publicly they should not be re-elected because they- they issued this, this call for congressional review. You brought up Greenland. This is the- the territory that Denmark has broad governance over, Denmark being a NATO ally. World leaders take President Trump's remarks seriously. We take him seriously and literally. And to that point, Denmark's Prime Minister publicly warned that it would mean the end of the NATO alliance if he carries out what he said. Which as recently as Friday, he said, I want to make a deal for Greenland the easy way, but if we don't do it the easy way, we are going to do it the hard way. Is there anything to stop the president from doing it quote, unquote, \"the hard way,\" which sounds like military force?",
      "SEN. KAINE: Margaret, I think Congress will stop them, both Democrats and Republicans. This would be disastrous. It wouldn't just be \"America First.\" It wouldn't just be the end of NATO, it would be America alone. If we take our best allies, and Denmark has been an ally for a very long time, and we decide that we have the military ability to seize territory for them, you will see the United States, instead of being the world's chief diplomat and a leader in the world, you'll see the United States isolated as a pariah. And I've talked to my Republican colleagues, they- they watch what the president has done is Venezue- in Venezuela. They hear the threats against other nations. I can tell you this, we will force a vote in the Senate about no U.S. military action in Greenland or Denmark. If we need to, we will get overwhelming bipartisan support that this president is foolish to even suggest this. We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not going to do it the easy way, either we're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will watch for action in Congress on that front. Senator Kaine, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This morning, President Trump vowed that Venezuela now has the military protection of the US. This comes just one week after he said the US would run that country. Meanwhile, Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is expected to travel to Washington to meet with President Trump this week. For his part, Mr. Trump and his team met with dozens of US oil executives late last week, urging them to commit $100 billion to boost oil production there. Joining us now to discuss it all is the United States Secretary of Energy, Chris Wright, good to have you here in person.",
      "SECRETARY CHRIS WRIGHT: Thanks for having me, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Before I ask you about Venezuela, very quickly, these protests in Iran, not this country reliant on oil to keep its government controlled economy afloat. The President has been briefed on military options. What is the US willing to do to help?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Certainly the President has been very outspoken about wanting to have freedom and rule of law and capitalism and great relations with the United States return. So we'll see. I think his moral support has been strong. Certainly, he's taken a strong stance against the mullahs in Iran in disabling their nuclear program. I think the people in Iran are rising up because they feel there's a strong America that has their back. I won't go into the specifics there, but we wish them well, and we'd love to see a free and democratic Iran again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Will there be more interdictions of vessels carrying Iranian oil? Any more activity on that front?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I won't reveal any change in position there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, let me ask you about Venezuela,",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: where you have been very focused and very central to the President's policy. The President said that Venezuela now has the United States, the most powerful military in the world, to protect them. To protect them, we will.\u00a0 Is the United States military providing security guarantees for American companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We're not doing that right now, but what we, what he means, is we're changing the game for what's happening in the ground in Venezuela. Venezuela has purchased $20 billion of Russian weapons. They got Cuban mercenaries there. They supply oil to Cuba. They, they harbor the Hezbollah's headquarters for the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has been a very dangerous, very destabilized place going down the tubes. And with the United States influence now by controlling the sale of their oil and therefore the flow of funds into the country, we think we're going to, we will see relatively rapid change, improvement on the ground in Venezuela. This is a process. We're only eight days into the process, but it's off to a strong start.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's off to a quick start. You had the oil executives at the White House just Friday. That the President, excuse me, the State Department yesterday had a security alert I want to ask you about because it specifically cited the risk to Americans in Venezuela, and it said armed militias are setting up roadblocks, searching vehicles for evidence of US citizenship or support for the US. The man who runs those militias is Diosdado Cabello, who is the Minister of the Interior. Is he ordering the hunting of Americans?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Not that we are aware of, but we should be cautious. Look, this is, as they say, eight days into a change into a change of leadership there. The interim authorities are trying to establish power. Collectivos have been running wild over, over Venezuela for, for over a decade. So, yeah, you're not going to\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well he controls them.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: He does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So is he safe in his position? Because right now the administration seems to be working with him.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: We need to work with the people that have the guns today to ultimately move the country to a representative government and a better station. But what you've got to prevent in the mean term is a collapse of the nation. And I think the strong moves we're making right now is to influence the people with the guns today, which is part of a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're not concerned he's going to undermine the more business minded President Delcy Rodriguez?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Oh, of course we're worried about things like that. We need to get stability among the leadership in Venezuela. So yes, of course we're concerned about those things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So tell me broadly, is the Trump administration's goal here to acquire the state oil company, PDVSA, and to run it. Are you going to put Americans on the board? How is this going to work?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, again, it's a process. The first thing to do is to reduce the damage to the United States, the inflow of guns and criminals and immigrants and drugs into the United States, the destabilizing of a key part of the Western Hemisphere. We need to stop that. That's why we've entered into Venezuela. Certainly, part of the way to improve Venezuela and to improve the Western Hemisphere and improve the lives of Americans is to get their very corrupt 25 years in decline, oil industry back going again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Does that mean the United States government is going to run it? The president says we're going to run the country. Are we running this as like as an American state owned oil company essentially?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: No. Today we are running the sale of their crudes. You know, we have a quarantine around their ability to ship oil outside of Venezuela. All of that goes through American crude marketers, and then that crude goes out into the market. We collect those funds and bring them back to Venezuela to better the lives of Americans and Venezuelans. But in the long run, what will happen with Venezuelan oil resources? Yeah, of course, quite likely you'll see American companies' expanded presence there. You'll see growing production. Of course, you're going to see more American involvement in there. But exactly how that's going to work, that's going to unfold over time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So back in November, us, Judge backed a bid by an American hedge fund to purchase Citgo Petroleum. The Treasury still has to approve that deal. The hedge fund is actually run by a big Trump donor, Paul Singer. Do you want to preserve Venezuelan ownership of Citgo? Do you want to have America have a financial stake in it, like Trump bought a big portion of an intel company, do you want to own portions of oil companies?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Again, that's going to be up to American businesses. That's certainly a very real possibility. The Citgo sale is part of, is part of bringing redress to creditors of the United States for the Venezuelan Government. And of course, one, one of the capital providers in that transaction is a hedge fund provider you just mentioned. There's lots of American investors and American refining entrepreneurs that are involved in that so to take Venezuelan owned refineries that are in the United States and legally through an auction process, transfer them to American owners and American entrepreneurs in the refining business. I think that's fantastic.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's concern about corruption here, though. Will there be Americans installed on these boards? And how do you respond to these allegations that some Trump donors are going to get preferential treatment?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: I can assure you that is absolutely not the case. Absolutely not the case. Think of what President Trump has done for the American oil and gas industry. He's driven down the price of oil. He's dramatically reduced\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's an over supply of oil. And now you're going to put more on the market.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. That's not- That's not good for American oil and gas companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it makes it less profitable for them to actually go and invest in drill, baby, drill.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Exactly. Democrats and President Biden are fantastic for American oil and gas companies because they try to restrict the supply to something that's essential to life, which only has one possible impact, which is to drive up prices and grow profitability. So President Trump is no, is no helper to the oil and gas industry. And certainly there's no corruption, preferential placement of people. There's none of that. I can assure you of that. I'm in the center of this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How are you going to decide the contracts? Is the Treasury going to approve the Citgo dominance there in that\u2013",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: That went through a large auction to buy it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "Are you going to brief to Congress the decisions you're making about which firms get access?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: Absolutely. All that was an auction open to all American firms. There were many bidders, including the coalition of bidders you mentioned. We want those assets to get as much money as possible, to go back to the creditors of the Venezuelan Government. And we want American refinery assets owned by Americans that are going to increase the throughput, drive down the price of gasoline in America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. So Secretary Rubio said there's a three point plan, stabilize, rehabilitate, transition. This sounds indefinite, even when you heard some of those oil executives, Chevron's leadership, they're already in Venezuela, we should say, said it will take 18 to 24 months to even increase oil production by 50%. So how long is this American involvement? Because he's saying there, it's at least a year and a half, two years.",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: They've been there for 100 years, and likely, Chevron's going to be there 50 years from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the United States government, how long does that role continue?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT: You heard the third part of Rubio's question, which is transition. We want to bring a representative government to the people of Venezuela. I think then you'll see the full sovereignty back to the government of Venezuela. We don't have a legitimate government of Venezuela today. We'd like to move and get there, but America\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is there a timeline?",
      "SEC. CHRIS WRIGHT:\u00a0 25 years, this country has gone in decline. President Trump out of the box, creative intervention has allowed us to change the game. But, yeah, I don't know the timeline of that. It's not weeks, it's more months. Could be a year or two could be more.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Secretary Wright, thank you for your time today.",

      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said Sunday that he believes there would be bipartisan opposition to the use of American forces as part of an effort to take Greenland.",
      "\"I think Congress will stop him, both Democrats and Republicans,\" the Virginia senator said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "President Trump has long signaled he wants an American takeover of the world's largest island, a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. He doubled down on Jan. 9, saying \"I would like to make a deal the easy way, but if we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way.\"",
      "Kaine said neither option would be acceptable. He cited Denmark's long history as a NATO ally.",
      "\"We're not going to do it the hard way, and we're not gonna do it the easy way either. We're going to continue to work with Denmark as a sovereign nation that we're allied with, and we're not going to treat them as an adversary or as an enemy,\" Kaine said.",
      "Leaders in both Denmark and Greenland have decried Mr. Trump's plan. Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen and four party leaders said in a statement Friday night that, \"We don't want to be Americans, we don't want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders.\"",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has warned that an American takeover of Greenland would mark the end of the 76-year-old NATO alliance. Kaine echoed those comments Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\"",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 11, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, who represents a large portion of that city. It's good to have you here.",
      "REP. ILHAN OMAR: I represent the whole city. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you. The Trump administration is actively telling the public that journalists are misleading them. You heard what was just reported from the scene. What we know is that Renee Macklin Good and her partner were protesters. They were driving around Minneapolis. They were recording what some of these ICE enforcement officers were doing. And the local police chief says Macklin Good blocked the street with her car. President Trump has said that the partner was a paid agitator, that's the phrase he used. Secretary Noem alleged this was an act of terrorism. Given how much heat there is and the administration's scrutiny, would you tell Americans it's too dangerous to demonstrate and to go out and document as she was doing?",
      "REP. OMAR: I think it is really important for Americans to record to create the level of accountability and transparency that we need. What we have seen in Minneapolis is ICE agents oftentimes jumping out of their cars. These are unmarked cars. Oftentimes they're wearing a mask. They're approaching, running towards cars. They're pulling people out of those cars. Oftentimes these people are citizens. Oftentimes these people have documentation of their legal right to be in this country, and we know that DHS has lied repeatedly when it comes to these accounts, so it is even more important for there to be recording from eyewitnesses every single time these actions are taking place.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you see from the recordings that we see, is there anything that you believe was- that was being done that should not have been done by Macklin Good? The administration says she was blocking the road. They are claiming this is an act of terrorism.",
      "REP. OMAR: Yeah. Renee Nicole Good, as you hear her say, she's not mad. She's sitting in her car peacefully, waving cars to get by this agent, as you see, gets out of his car, automatically starts running towards her, trying to open her door. She feels scared, she tries to turn the wheel away. And then you see the other officer- who can clearly see the car is moving, move towards the front of the car. Which, if they are saying that he has 10 years on service and is trained, he should know that you shouldn't be trying to get in front of a moving car, and so it is not acceptable for Kristi Noem and the president and the vice president to make these kind of judgments without there being a full investigation, even though we can see in the videos that have been produced so far that what they are describing is really not what is taking place. And so if they're saying that we shouldn't believe our eyes, then let the investigation take place before you characterize this mother of three as a domestic terrorist. Prove to us what documentation you have. That, one, that she was paid. Two, that she was agitating when we can hear her say she's not mad, she's not upset. She's clearly trying to wave cars to bypass her. And so it's just- this level of rhetoric is unjustifiable to the American people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just quickly on that you said accountability, and it's important for people to document what's happening. I just want to be abundantly clear, because the administration says that their officers are being stalked and harassed. When you say accountability, you are only describing recording like she was doing?",
      "REP. OMAR: I think it is fair for citizens to document what law enforcement is doing\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's been violence against some of these agents as well.",
      "REP. OMAR: Well, there's also been violence against residents in Minneapolis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There right now is a lot of heat on your state. Treasury Secretary Bessent called Minnesota ground zero for what may be the most egregious welfare scam in our nation's history to date. 85 of the 98 people who were charged by the Justice Department with this welfare scheme are Somali. And you know this, the treasury secretary is probing whether any of the money was somehow funneled outside the country, he actually issued new standards. He's going to make it- make someone disclose if they receive public assistance when they try to wire money out of the country, and he's lowered the bar for suspicious activity. What is the practical impact of doing that in the community?",
      "REP. OMAR: It's just creating fear. What they are doing is creating confusion, chaos, trying to intimidate people from being able to exercise their regular, normal activities that they would. There is no justification in any of the things that they say. The 87 people that you've described as being investigated, many of them adjudicated, all happened under the Biden administration. There is no justification for this surge. We know that ICE has the ability to conduct raids. There is no reason have over 2000 people coming in to our city and creating the level of terror that they have created.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration argues that they have to do it because the state failed to, right--",
      "REP. OMAR: The state- the federal government and the state have been working peacefully together and have brought justice to these 87 people that you've described. None of the surge that they have conducted has produced any sort of criminal activity. They haven't been able to charge anyone as of yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the administration also announced they're going to cut food stamps to Minnesota because they say some of the food stamp money had been embezzled. Are you confident--",
      "REP. OMAR: And those are the things that are being litigated, and it is again, unconstitutional for them to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But is it- are you confident that the fraud that has been discovered is no longer being conducted now? Is there any justification for saying this food stamp money is somehow being misused?",
      "REP. OMAR: There are ways to investigate fraud, which we have been doing in Minnesota, which the federal government has been doing under the Biden administration. There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these- funding these programs. The only reason they are doing that is for PR purposes, and it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents, and it is creating the kind of chaos and confusion that no one needs in this moment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because the administration and many conservative allies in the administration argue that this is still ongoing. There was that conservative influencer who went out and posted this video that went viral, alleging that daycare facilities were pocketing public funds--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. OMAR: And as you know, he went hours where these businesses were not operating.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yep, CBS went out and did its own investigation--",
      "REP. OMAR: --yeah which, again creates the level of confusion and chaos that is not necessary in a moment when we are trying to deal with a serious problem that needs serious people to be able to address it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But do you think- there was no recorded evidence of fraud, according to the CBS investigation that was conducted, but Governor Walz did choose to not run for reelection. He dropped out of the race because of all of this.",
      "REP. OMAR: Because he wants to focus on defending our state and not defending a seat.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you think there has been a sufficient level of accountability and ownership of the failure to have oversight here? Do you think this ends?",
      "REP. OMAR: That is what we want. We want to collaborately [sic] work with the administration to try to make sure that there is no fraud that's being perpetuated on our state. What we do not want is the level of terror, of confusion, of chaos that is being created without any results in this moment.",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Very quickly, before I let you go, the Chair Oversight Committee said that he wants to refer you to the Ethics Committee.",
      "REP. OMAR: I've been referred like 100 times, so go ahead.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's looking at your husband's income and net worth. He said it was tied to private equity investment funds, but he seems to be insinuating that you personally are tied into this welfare scam. How do you respond to that?",
      "REP. OMAR: Ever since I've gotten to Congress, they have been doing these sort of weird ethics investigations, none of them have yielded anything because I have been as transparent as I can be, and there is nothing wrong with any documentation that I have ever provided to the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman Omar, thank you for joining us today. 'Face the Nation' will be back in one minute. Stay with us.",

      "Protests in Iran\u00a0continued in the Islamic Republic, online videos purported to show, despite threats from the country's theocracy to crack down on demonstrators after shutting down the internet and cutting telephone lines off to the world.",
      "An external rights group that relies on information from contacts inside Iran said Saturday that at least 116 people have been killed in the protests, which\u00a0began in Tehran in late December\u00a0as anger over Iran's ailing economy, but quickly spread and morphed into the most significant challenge to the government in years.",
      "The protesters appeared to be taking encouragement from repeated declarations of support by the Trump administration, and by the country's exiled crown prince, who called on them to try and overwhelm security forces and seize towns and cities.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei accused President Trump of having hands \"stained with the blood of Iranians\" in remarks aired Friday on Iranian state TV, as supporters gathered before him shouted \"Death to America!\"",
      "Protesters are \"ruining their own streets ... in order to please the president of the United States,\" the 86-year-old Khamenei said to the crowd at his compound in Tehran. \"Because he said that he would come to their aid. He should pay attention to the state of his own country instead.\"",
      "Iranian state TV is reporting on security force casualties while portraying control over the nation, without discussing dead demonstrators, whom it increasingly refers to as \"terrorists.\" However, it also acknowledged protests went on into Sunday morning, with demonstrations in Tehran and in the holy city of Mashhad to the northeast.",
      "Khamenei has signaled a coming clampdown, despite U.S. warnings. Tehran escalated its threats Saturday, with the Iran's attorney general, Mohammad Movahedi Azad, warning that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an \"enemy of God,\" a death-penalty charge. The statement carried by Iranian state television said even those who \"helped rioters\" would face the charge.",
      "\"Prosecutors must carefully and without delay, by issuing indictments, prepare the grounds for the trial and decisive confrontation with those who, by betraying the nation and creating insecurity, seek foreign domination over the country,\" the statement read. \"Proceedings must be conducted without leniency, compassion or indulgence.\"",
      "Trump issues fresh warnings to Iran's leaders",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly pledged to strike Iran if protesters are killed, a threat that has taken on greater significance after the U.S. military raid that seized Venezuela's former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. He issued a message of support to protestors on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!! President DONALD J. TRUMP,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "A day earlier, Mr. Trump said that any possible American strike wouldn't \"mean boots on the ground but that means hitting them very, very hard where it hurts.\"",
      "\"Iran's in big trouble,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago.\"",
      "He added, \"I tell the Iranian leaders you better not start shooting because we'll start shooting too.\"",
      "In a brief social media post published in the very early hours of Saturday morning in Washington, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said \"the United States supports the brave people of Iran.\"",
      "Iranian regime warns protesters will be punished \"without any legal leniency\"",
      "Iran's judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei separately vowed that punishment for protesters \"will be decisive, maximum and without any legal leniency.\"",
      "According to the Washington D.C.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which was founded by anti-regime activists, as of Saturday, the 14th day of unrest in Iran, at least 116 people had been killed, including at least 37 members of the security forces. More than 2,600 people had been arrested, and protests were recorded in at least 185 cities.",
      "The agency found that those who were killed died by live ammunition or pellet gunfire, predominantly from close range.",
      "Iranian authorities shut down the internet on Thursday night as protests escalated sharply, seemingly as people heeded a call by the exiled crown prince, a vocal opposition figure, for Iranians to raise their voices against the regime. Iranian state media has shown only pro-government demonstrations. But the few social media videos that have made it through the internet blockade tell a different story.",
      "According to an update posted online Sunday morning local time by the monitoring organization NetBlocks, stated that the blackout \"is now past the 60 hour mark as national connectivity levels continue to flatline around 1% of ordinary levels. The censorship measure presents a direct threat to the safety and wellbeing of Iranians at a key moment for the country's future.\"",
      "That communications blackout has made it incredibly difficult to gain a clear picture of the scale of the protests overall \u2014 and the Iranian authorities' response to it. Some other reports put the death toll from unrest much higher, with TIME citing a doctor in Tehran as saying at least 217 people had been killed, for instance.",
      "Staff at three Iranian hospitals told CBS News partner BBC News that their facilities were overwhelmed by the number of dead and injured patients.",
      "BBC Persian verified that about 70 bodies were brought to Poursina Hospital in Rasht Friday night local time, but because the morgue was at full capacity, the bodies had to be taken away.",
      "A hospital worker in Tehran told BBC News there were so many wounded patients brought in that staff did not have time to perform CPR.",
      "Iranian authorities have acknowledged a few deaths, but usually only those of security forces.",
      "A doctor and medic at two hospitals in Iran told CBS News partner BBC News that their facilities were overwhelmed with injuries. The doctor said a Tehran eye hospital had gone into crisis mode, while the BBC also obtained a message from a medic in another hospital who said the facility did not have enough surgeons to handle the influx of patients. The medic claimed many of the wounded had gunshot injuries to the head and eyes.",
      "Asked by CBS News how seriously he believes Iran's autocratic rulers are taking the warnings from Mr. Trump not to kill protesters, Maziar Bahari, editor of the IranWire news website, said he was certain it had \"really scared many Iranian officials, and may have affected their actions in terms of how to confront the protestors.\"",
      "\"But at the same time ... it has inspired many protesters to come out, because they know that the leader of the world's main superpower is supporting their cause,\" said Bahari, who spent months in Iranian prisons after being arrested during a previous round of massive unrest in 2009.",
      "\"Many people have called what is happening in Iran right now a revolution,\" Bahari told CBS News' Haley Ott. \"And we can see different signs of revolution in Iran at the movement. But a revolution usually needs a leader for the revolution. But we don't have that leader.\"",
      "But while decades of draconian control over the media and the deliberate sidelining of dissident voices in the country have deprived Iran of a clear opposition figurehead inside the country's borders, many in the vast Iranian diaspora hope the nation's ousted royal family could stage a comeback.",
      "Online videos contradict state media",
      "Saturday marks the start of the work week in Iran, but many schools and universities reportedly held online classes, Iranian state TV reported. Internal Iranian government websites are believed to be functioning.",
      "State TV repeatedly played a driving, martial orchestral arrangement from the \"Epic of Khorramshahr\" by Iranian composer Majid Entezami, while showing pro-government demonstrations. The song, aired repeatedly during the 12-day war between Israel and Iran last year, honors Iran's 1982 liberation of the city of Khorramshahr during the Iran-Iraq war. It has been used in videos of protesting women cutting away their hair to protest the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini as well.",
      "Meanwhile, state television reported that \"peace prevailed in most cities of the country\" overnight, with \"no news of any gathering or chaos in Tehran and most provinces.\" That was directly contradicted by an online video verified by the Associated Press that showed demonstrations in Tehran's Saadat Abad area. Thousands gathered in the street, and one man could be heard chanting \"Death to Khamenei!\"",
      "The semiofficial Fars news agency, believed to be close to Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and one of the few media outlets able to publish to the outside world, released surveillance camera footage of what it said came from demonstrations in Isfahan. In it, a protester appeared to fire a long gun, while others set fires and threw gasoline bombs at what appeared to be a government compound.",
      "The Young Journalists' Club, associated with state TV, reported that protesters killed three members of the Guard's all-volunteer Basij force in the city of Gachsaran. It also reported a security official was stabbed to death in Hamadan province, a police officer was killed in the port city of Bandar Abbas, and another in Gilan, as well as one person was slain in Mashhad.",
      "State television also aired footage of a funeral service attended by hundreds in Qom, a Shiite seminary city just south of Tehran.",
      "Iran's theocracy cut off the nation from the internet and international telephone calls on Thursday, though it allowed some state-owned and semiofficial media to publish. Qatar's state-funded Al Jazeera news network reported live from Iran, but they appeared to be the only major foreign outlet able to work.",
      "Head of Iran's exiled royal family predicts his return is \"very near\"",
      "Iran's exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi has been seen by many analysts as a galvanizing force behind the momentum of this round of protests. On Saturday, he called on Iranians not only to continue coming out into the streets, but to try to seize control of towns and cities from the authorities by overwhelming them.",
      "\"Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centers,\" Pahlavi said in his latest video message posted on social media, calling for more demonstrations on Saturday and Sunday.\"",
      "Striking an optimistic tone, Pahlavi declared that he was \"preparing to return to my homeland,\" suggesting the day on which he would be able to do so was \"very near.\"",
      "But Pahlavi has lived in exile for nearly 50 years, and while he has long sought to position himself as a leader-in-waiting, it's far from clear how much real support he has inside the country.",
      "His father, Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was widely despised inside Iran when he fled into exile himself amid street protests in 1979, as the Islamic Revolution that brought the current regime to power took hold.

    "story": [
      "Kurdish fighters were evacuated from a contested neighborhood in Syria's northern city of Aleppo, officials said early Sunday local time, a move that could bring an end to several days of violent clashes with government forces.",
      "State-run news agency SANA reported buses transported the last of the fighters from the Aleppo neighborhood of Sheikh Maqsoud to northeastern Syria, which is under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.",
      "\"Through international mediation to halt the attacks and violations against our people in Aleppo, we have reached an understanding leading to a ceasefire and the safe evacuation of martyrs, the wounded, trapped civilians, and fighters from the Achrafieh and Sheikh Maqsoud neighborhoods to northern and eastern Syria,\" SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said in a post on X.",
      "He called for \"mediators to uphold their promises to stop the violations and work towards the safe return of the displaced to their homes.\"",
      "An Associated Press journalist at the scene saw buses leaving Sunday and was told by officials that the transports carried 360 fighters. Other buses carrying civilians and detained fighters departed on Saturday.",
      "Syrian security forces deployed Saturday in Sheikh Maqsoud after days of clashes with Kurdish fighters that killed and wounded dozens.",
      "During the day, several drone strikes were reported in Aleppo, Syria's largest city, leading authorities to stop civilian flights at Aleppo International Airport until further notice, state TV said.",
      "On Saturday afternoon, an explosive drone hit the Aleppo Governorate building shortly after two Cabinet ministers and a local official held a news conference on the developments in the city. There was no immediate word on casualties.",
      "Syria's state TV aired footage showing a drone exploding as it slammed into the building and blamed Kurdish fighters for the attack. The SDF denied the reports, saying its fighters did not attack a civilian target.",
      "The fighting between the two sides is the most intense since the fall of then-President Bashar Assad in December 2024. At least 22 people were killed in five days of clashes and more than 140,000 were displaced.",
      "U.S. Special Envoy to Syria Tom Barrack held talks in Damascus Saturday with top officials, including President Ahmad al-Sharaa, and called on all parties to cease hostilities and return to dialogue.",
      "\"Violence risks undermining the progress achieved since the fall of the Assad regime and invites external interference that serves no party's interests,\" Barrack said in comments posted on X. \"We urge all parties to exercise maximum restraint, immediately cease hostilities, and return to dialogue,\" he added, saying that fighting undermines the deal reached in March between the government and the Kurdish leadership.",
      "He said recent developments in Aleppo were \"deeply concerning,\" and Washington's objective \"remains a sovereign, unified Syria \u2014 at peace with itself and its neighbors \u2014 where equality, justice, and opportunity are extended to all its people.\"",
      "Syria's state news agency SANA reported that two Kurdish fighters blew themselves up while surrounded by security forces without inflicting casualties, as gunfire was still heard in the neighborhood of Sheikh Maqsoud around noon Saturday.",
      "From the early hours, Syrian security forces were sweeping the neighborhood after calling on residents to stay home for their own safety.",
      "Hundreds of people who fled the neighborhood days earlier were waiting at Sheikh Maqsoud's entrances to be allowed in once the military operations are over.",
      "Clashes broke out Tuesday in the predominantly Kurdish northern neighborhoods of Sheikh Maqsoud, Achrafieh and Bani Zaid, after the government and the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main Kurdish-led force in the country,\u00a0failed to make progress\u00a0on how to merge their forces into the national army. Security forces have since captured Achrafieh and Bani Zaid.",
      "Kurdish forces said at least 12 civilians were killed in the Kurdish-majority neighborhoods in the five days of fighting, while government officials reported at least 10 civilians were killed in the surrounding government-controlled areas.",
      "Syria's Information Minister Hamza al-Mustafa told state TV that Kurdish fighters used civilian buildings including hospitals and clinics during the fighting. Each side has accused the other of starting the violence and of deliberately targeting civilian neighborhoods and infrastructure, including ambulance crews and hospitals.",
      "The Kurdish-led Democratic Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, which controls much of Syria's northeast, said that security forces targeted Khaled Fajr Hospital in Sheikh Maqsoud, putting the lives of patients and paramedics in danger. It called on the international community to intervene to force government forces to stop shelling.",
      "State TV reported that at least one security member was wounded when a drone fired by the SDF struck the neighborhood.",
      "This also comes as the U.S. on Saturday conducted large-scale strikes against multiple Islamic State targets across Syria. The strikes targeted at least 35 locations.",

It's a huge step towards a democratic transition.\"",
      "Machado dedicated the prize to Mr. Trump, along with the people of Venezuela, shortly after it\u00a0was announced. Mr. Trump has coveted and has openly campaigned for winning the Nobel Prize himself since his return to office.",

      "Mr. Trump reiterated on Friday that he would like to make a deal to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous region that's part of NATO ally Denmark, \"the easy way.\" He said that if the U.S. doesn't own it, then Russia or China will take it over, and the U.S. does not want them as neighbors. NATO allies and Greenland have disagreed with Mr. Trump's assessment.",
      "\"If we don't do it the easy way, we're going to do it the hard way,\" Mr. Trump said, without explaining what that entailed. The White House stated that it is considering a range of options, including the use of military force, to acquire the island.

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday that he wants \"all options to be on the table,\" including a potential ban on Elon Musk's X platform in Britain, over the use of its artificial intelligence tool Grok to generate sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "Starmer's remarks come as Musk's platform faces scrutiny from regulators across the globe over Grok's image editing tool, which has allowed users to create digitally altered, sexualized photos of real people,\u00a0including minors.",
      "\"This is disgraceful, it's disgusting and it's not to be tolerated. X has got to get a grip of this,\" Starmer said in an interview with a U.K. radio station. \"It's unlawful. We're not going to tolerate it. I've asked for all options to be on the table.\"",
      "A source in Starmer's office reiterated to CBS News on Friday that \"nothing is off the table\" when it comes to regulating X in Britain.",
      "CBS News has verified that Grok fulfilled user requests asking it to edit images of women to show them in bikinis or little clothing, including prominent public figures such as\u00a0first lady Melania Trump.",
      "Last week, Grok, a chatbot developed by Musk's company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "Grok told users that as of Friday, access to its image generation tool was limited \"to paying subscribers\" of its user verification service. Paying subscribers have to provide their credit card and personal details to the company, which could dissuade some people from using the service, especially if they had intended to use Grok's AI tool to create illegal images of minors.",
      "xAI responded to a CBS News request for comment to criticism of Grok's image generation tool and steps it had taken to limit access to it on Friday, by saying: \"Legacy media lies.\"",
      "Addressing reporters on Friday morning, a U.K. government spokesperson called the move to limit access to Grok's image editing tool to paying users \"insulting\" to victims of misogyny and sexual violence, saying it, \"simply turns an AI feature that allows the creation of unlawful images into a premium service.\"",
      "Under the U.K. Online Safety Act, sharing intimate images without consent on social media is a criminal offense, and social media companies are required to proactively remove such content, as well as prevent it from appearing in the first place.",
      "If they fail to do so, the companies can face hefty fines or, in last resort cases, face what would effectively be a ban by Britain's independent media regulator Ofcom. Ofcom can compel payment providers, advertisers and internet service providers to stop working with a site, preventing it from generating money or being accessed from the U.K.",
      "In a post shared Monday on its own X account, Ofcom said it was \"aware of serious concerns raised about a feature on Grok on X that produces undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.\"",
      "\"We have made urgent contact with X and xAI to understand what steps they have taken to comply with their legal duties to protect users in the UK. Based on their response we will undertake a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation,\" Ofcom said.",
      "Musk's platform has faced scrutiny from governments around the world, including the European Union and the U.S. Congress, over Grok AI's digital alteration of real images.",
      "On Wednesday, Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a post on X that \"many of the recent AI-generated posts are unacceptable and a clear violation of my legislation \u2014 now law \u2014 the\u00a0Take It Down Act, as well as X's terms and conditions.\"",
      "\"These unlawful images pose a serious threat to victims' privacy and dignity. They should be taken down and guardrails should be put in place,\" Cruz said, adding that he was encouraged by steps taken by X to remove unlawful images.",
      "On Thursday, Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Republican member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, threatened to sanction the U.K. government if Starmer moved to ban X in the U.K.",
      "\"If Starmer is successful in banning @X in Britain, I will move forward with legislation that is currently being drafted to sanction not only Starmer, but Britain as a whole,\" Paulina Luna said in a post on her own X account.",

    "summary": "Greenland is 836,000 square miles of largely frozen ground northeast of Canada. So why does the White House say it \"should be part of the United States\"?",
    "story": [
      "Why does the United States want control of Greenland? President Trump has made it clear that he thinks the U.S. needs to control the Arctic island to ensure the security of America and its NATO allies, a point those allies \u2014 and Greenland \u2014 vehemently disagree with.",
      "But there's more at play here, including a valuable shipping route and access to mineral resources.",
      "Here's what interests the U.S. about the semi-autonomous Danish territory:",
      "\"It's so strategic right now\"",
      "Greenland spans about 836,000 square miles, much of it covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. It's home to only around 60,000 people and is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark with its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes.",
      "\"It's so strategic right now,\" he told reporters on Sunday, Jan. 4. \"Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place ... We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.\"",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News earlier this year.",
      "Control over a new, valuable route for shipping",
      "Melting sea ice around Greenland has created more opportunity to use the Northern Sea route \u2014 allowing shippers to save millions of dollars in fuel by taking a shorter route between Europe and Asia that was long only passable in warmer months.",
      "A Russian commercial vessel, aided by an icebreaker, first traversed the route in the winter in February 2021.",

Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November 2024.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources. Both minerals are needed to produce batteries for electric vehicles and a wide array of other technologies.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals such as Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "China produces about 70% of rare earth elements, and demand for rare earth minerals continues to grow with technological advances and the rapid spread of consumer devices that require the resources.",
      "There are, however, significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Most Greenlanders don't want to be American",
      "Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said Tuesday that his country wants good relations with the U.S. and did not \"think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight, and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation.\"",
      "A poll conducted a year ago showed that 85% of Greenlanders did not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News ahead of a visit last year to the island by Vice President JD Vance and his wife.",
      "A brief history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency.",
      "It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, and the European nation carried on as a colonial ruler of Greenland until 1953, when it fully laid out its relations with the island as a semi-autonomous territory.",

      "Safer alternatives",
      "For those at higher risk, Patel recommends non-NSAID approaches whenever possible.",
      "\"For many patients, this means starting with non-drug strategies such as heat or ice, physical therapy and activity modification,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"If medication is needed, acetaminophen is generally preferred over oral NSAIDs from a cardiovascular standpoint, although regular use should still be monitored in people with hypertension.\"",

      "TOPPLING MADURO WAS EASY \u2014 GOVERNING VENEZUELA COULD TRAP US FOR YEARS",
      "\"I don\u2019t think Putin or Xi ever doubted that power overrides sovereignty,\" said Pedro Garmendia, a Washington-based geopolitical risk analyst. \"What we\u2019ve seen consistently from China and Russia is that they use rhetoric around international law when it suits them and ignore it when it doesn\u2019t.\"",
      "For U.S. adversaries, the most jarring signal may not be diplomatic fallout but the stark demonstration of American lethality.",
      "The operation resulted in the deaths of dozens of Venezuelan and Cuban security personnel, according to Venezuelan and Cuban authorities, as U.S. forces pushed through layers of armed resistance protecting Maduro. Cuban officials acknowledged the loss of multiple military and intelligence personnel deployed in Venezuela, while Venezuelan authorities confirmed heavy casualties among elite security units. Independent estimates place the total death toll \u2014 security forces and civilians combined \u2014 at several dozen.",
      "President Donald Trump publicly acknowledged the nature of the mission, describing it afterward as a violent operation by necessity, given the threat environment and the presence of armed foreign forces embedded within Maduro\u2019s security apparatus. Trump argued the level of force reflected the reality of penetrating a defended capital and preventing Maduro from escaping or rallying loyalist units.",
      "Analysts say that willingness to use decisive force \u2014 and to own it publicly \u2014 carries its own deterrent value.",
      "Garmendia noted that Venezuela was no marginal partner for U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Both countries have invested tens of billions of dollars in the Ch\u00e1vez and then Maduro regime,\" he said. \"Having the leader of that regime captured and taken into U.S. custody so suddenly \u2014 especially when a Chinese special envoy had just met with Maduro hours before \u2014 is frankly embarrassing to both countries.\"",

      "U.S. special operations forces spent months rehearsing the raid, including training on a full-scale replica of Maduro\u2019s compound. CIA officers built a detailed picture of Maduro\u2019s daily routines \u2014 tracking when he slept, where he traveled, how his security rotated and which locations offered the narrowest escape routes.",
      "That intelligence allowed planners to identify a precise window when Maduro was most vulnerable. Airspace suppression, rapid insertion and coordinated ground movement unfolded in minutes, denying Venezuelan and allied forces time to respond effectively.",
      "Trump later pointed to that preparation as evidence the operation was deliberate rather than impulsive, arguing that speed and overwhelming force were essential to prevent Maduro from slipping away or turning the operation into a prolonged firefight.",

      "\"That sends a strong signal that the United States can find its adversaries anywhere in the world,\" he said, arguing rivals already inclined to violate international norms are unlikely to be emboldened by an action they lack the capability to replicate.",
      "The final deterrent signal lies in experience: the institutional ability to plan and execute complex, intelligence-driven operations built on decades of counterterrorism and special operations campaigns.",
      "U.S. officials point to the seamless integration of intelligence collection, rehearsal, logistics and kinetic force as evidence of a mature operational system that can be activated with little warning \u2014 an advantage adversaries must assume exists even when they cannot see it.",
      "Concern has nevertheless been echoed by international institutions.",

      "WHY JANUARY IS THE BEST TIME TO REMOVE PERSONAL DATA ONLINE",
      "Android TV streaming boxes promising unlimited channels for a one-time fee may quietly turn home internet connections into proxy networks, according to security researchers. (Photo By Paul Chinn/The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)",
      "What's inside these streaming boxes",
      "According to an investigation by Krebs on Security, media streaming devices don't behave like ordinary media streamers once they're connected to your network. Researchers closely examine SuperBox, which is an Android-based streaming box sold through third-party sellers on major retail platforms. On paper, SuperBox markets itself as just hardware. The company claims it doesn't pre-install pirated apps and insists users are responsible for what they install. That sounds reassuring until you look at how the device actually works.",
      "To unlock the thousands of channels SuperBox advertises, you must first remove Google's official app ecosystem and replace it with an unofficial app store. That step alone should raise eyebrows. Once those custom apps are installed, the device doesn't just stream video but also begins routing internet traffic through third-party proxy networks.",
      "What this means is that your home internet connection may be used to relay traffic for other people. That traffic can include ad fraud, credential stuffing attempts and large-scale web scraping.",
      "During testing by Censys, a cyber intelligence company that tracks internet-connected devices, SuperBox models immediately contacted servers tied to Tencent's QQ messaging service, run by Tencent, as well as a residential proxy service called Grass.",
      "Grass describes itself as an opt-in network that lets you earn rewards by sharing unused internet bandwidth. This suggests that SuperBox devices may be using SDKs or tooling that hijack bandwidth without clear user consent, effectively turning the box into a node inside a proxy network.",
      "Why SuperBox activity resembles botnet behavior",
      "In simple terms, a botnet is a large group of compromised devices that work together to route traffic or perform online tasks without the owners realizing it.",
      "Researchers discovered SuperBox devices contained advanced networking and remote access tools that have no business being on a streaming box. These included utilities like Tcpdump and Netcat, which are commonly used for network monitoring and traffic interception.",
      "The devices performed DNS hijacking and ARP poisoning on local networks, techniques used to redirect traffic and impersonate other devices on the same network. Some models even contained directories labeled \"secondstage,\" suggesting additional payloads or functionality beyond streaming.",
      "SuperBox is just one brand in a crowded market of no-name Android streaming devices. Many of them promise free content and quick setup, but often come preloaded with malware or require unofficial app stores that expose users to serious risk.",
      "In July 2025, Google filed a lawsuit against operators behind what it called the BADBOX 2.0 botnet, a network of more than ten million compromised Android devices. These devices were used for advertising fraud and proxy services, and many were infected before consumers even bought them.",
      "Around the same time, the Feds warned that compromised streaming and IoT devices were\u00a0being used to gain unauthorized access to home networks\u00a0and funnel traffic into criminal proxy services.",
      "We reached out to SuperBox for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "8 steps you can take to protect yourself",
      "If you already own one of these streaming boxes or are thinking about buying one, these steps can help reduce your risk significantly.",
      "If a streaming box asks you to remove Google Play or install apps from an unknown marketplace, stop right there. This bypasses Android's built-in security checks and opens the door to malicious software. Legitimate Android TV devices don't require this.",
      "Even if the box itself is compromised, strong antivirus software on your computers and phones can detect suspicious network behavior, malicious connections or follow-on attacks like credential stuffing. Strong antivirus software monitors behavior, not just files, which matters when malware operates quietly in the background. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "If your router supports it, isolate smart TVs and streaming boxes from your main network. This prevents a compromised device from seeing your laptops, phones or work systems. It's one of the simplest ways to limit damage if something goes wrong.",
      "If your internet connection is being abused, stolen credentials often come next. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one leak doesn't unlock everything. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on suspicious or fake websites, which can alert you before you make a mistake.",

      "If you notice suspicious traffic or behavior, unplug the streaming box immediately and perform a factory reset on your router. In some cases, the safest option is to stop using the device altogether.",
      "Also, make sure your router firmware is up to date and that you've changed the default admin password. Compromised devices often try to exploit weak router settings to persist on a network.",
      "Unlimited premium channels for a one-time fee usually mean you're paying in some other way, often with your data, bandwidth or legal exposure. If a deal sounds too good to be true, it usually is.",

      "Streaming boxes like SuperBox thrive on frustration. As subscriptions pile up, people look for shortcuts. But when a device promises everything for nothing, it's worth asking what it's really doing behind the scenes. Research shows that some of these boxes don't just stream TV. They quietly turn your home network into a resource for others, sometimes for criminal activity. Cutting the cord shouldn't mean giving up control of your internet connection. Before plugging in that \"too good to be true\" box, it's worth slowing down and looking a little closer.",

      "Email scams have become one of the fastest ways scammers steal money from older adults. A single click can expose bank accounts, personal data and retirement savings built over a lifetime. That growing risk is what prompted Bob to write to us with a question many families are now facing:",
      "\"My friend's father is 95 and absolutely lives through his phone/laptop. He refuses to give up either and often clicks on email links. A few years ago, he got caught up in a gift card scam that almost cost him his life savings. It's not taking away the car keys anymore; it is taking away the email and access to online banking! What do you recommend that his daughter do to protect his online presence?\"",
      "Bob is right. For many seniors, email and online banking have replaced car keys as the most dangerous access point. The goal is not to take devices away. It is to quietly put guardrails in place so one bad click does not turn into a financial disaster.",

      "1) Separate money from daily email use",
      "Start by limiting how much damage a single click can cause. If possible, remove online banking access from the devices used for email. When that is not realistic, open a second checking account with only everyday spending money and link it to a debit card for routine purchases.",
      "Keep primary savings accounts offline or set to view-only access. If available, require in-branch or phone verification for transfers above a set amount. This way, even if credentials are compromised, the largest accounts remain protected.",
      "2) Lock down email to stop scams targeting seniors",
      "Email is the number one entry point for scams targeting seniors. Strong filtering matters. Use an email provider with advanced spam protection, such as Gmail or Outlook.com. In the email settings:",

      "If available, enable warnings for emails that use familiar display names but come from unfamiliar addresses. This helps stop impersonation scams that pretend to be family, banks or service providers. These steps slow scammers down and reduce impulse clicks before damage happens.",
      "Email is dominant, but voicemail and callback scams are also growing fast among seniors, often as a follow-up to phishing emails. If possible,\u00a0silence unknown callers and block voicemail-to-email transcription for unfamiliar numbers, since many scams now start with urgent callback messages rather than links.",
      "Email scams often start with messages that look routine but hide urgent threats designed to trigger quick clicks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Add a trusted second set of eyes",
      "Next, add safety nets that notify family members when something looks wrong. Enable banking alerts for large withdrawals, new payees, password changes, unusual logins and new device sign-ins. Add his daughter as a trusted contact wherever the bank allows it. If available, enable delays or approval requirements for first-time transfers to new payees. This creates a cooling period that can stop scam-driven transactions. For email accounts, set up a recovery contact so that his daughter is notified immediately if someone attempts to access or reset the account.",
      "Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) on email and banking accounts, but pair it with device and transfer alerts, since many scams now succeed even when 2FA is enabled.",
      "4) Harden devices so clicks do not equal catastrophe",
      "Devices should be set up to fail safely. Keep operating systems and browsers updated. Make sure the laptop uses a standard user account instead of an administrator account. This prevents software from installing without approval. Install real-time protection that blocks scam sites before they load. Strong antivirus software helps block malicious links and fake login pages automatically.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "5) Use a password manager to block fake logins",
      "Password reuse makes scams far more dangerous. Fake pop-ups and lookalike websites are designed to trick people into typing usernames and passwords by hand. A password manager removes that risk by storing credentials securely and autofilling them only on legitimate websites. If a page is fake or malicious, the password manager will not fill anything. That simple refusal often prevents account takeovers before they start. Password managers also reduce frustration by eliminating the need to remember or reuse passwords across email, banking and shopping accounts. When set up correctly, this protection works quietly in the background on both phones and laptops.",
      "Many\u00a0phishing scams no longer rely on obvious fake emails. They rely on realistic login pages. Autofill protection is one of the most effective ways to stop these attacks without changing daily habits.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "6) Freeze credit and monitor identity exposure",
      "If scammers already have personal information, prevention alone is not enough. Freeze credit with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax to prevent new accounts from being opened. Also, place freezes with ChexSystems and the National Consumer Telecom and Utilities Exchange to stop criminals from opening bank accounts, phone lines, or utility services in his name.",
      "If possible, request an IRS Identity Protection PIN to prevent tax-related identity theft.",
      "Add ongoing identity monitoring so suspicious activity triggers alerts quickly. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "8) Reduce exposure with a data removal service",
      "Scammers often find seniors by pulling personal details from public data broker websites. These sites publish phone numbers, addresses, relatives and age information that make targeting easier. A data removal service works behind the scenes to opt seniors out of these databases and reduce how much personal information is publicly available online. Fewer exposed details means fewer scam calls, fewer phishing emails and fewer impersonation attempts. This step does not stop every scam, but it significantly lowers how often seniors are targeted in the first place.",

      "Pro Tip: Use a secure email service for added privacy",
      "For families looking to go a step further, switching to a secure email service can significantly reduce scam exposure. Privacy-focused email providers are designed to limit tracking, block hidden tracking pixels, and reduce how much data advertisers or scammers can collect from inbox activity. Many secure email services also offer disposable or alias email addresses for one-time signups. If an alias starts receiving spam or scam messages, it can be disabled without affecting the main email account. This makes it easier to keep a primary email address private and limit long-term exposure. Secure email platforms typically include features like encrypted messages, no advertising and stronger privacy controls. While switching email providers is optional, it can be a useful upgrade for seniors who receive large volumes of spam or have been repeatedly targeted by scams.",
      "Why it matters:\u00a0Less tracking means fewer scam attempts. Aliases reduce how often personal email addresses are exposed, without changing daily habits.",

      "WHY JANUARY IS THE BEST TIME TO REMOVE PERSONAL DATA ONLINE",
      "1) App permissions",
      "What your apps are really allowed to see",
      "Every app on your phone requests permissions, approval to access features like your camera, microphone, location, contacts or photos. Some permissions are necessary for an app to function, but many apps ask for far more access than they actually need.",
      "Once granted, these permissions can allow apps to collect data in the background, sometimes even when you're not actively using them. Over time, this can quietly expose sensitive personal information.",
      "Regularly reviewing and limiting app permissions in your phone's settings is one of the easiest and most effective ways to improve your privacy. Pay special attention to apps with access to your location, microphone and photo library.",

      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts by requiring something you know (your password) and something you have, like a one-time code sent to your phone or generated by an app.",
      "Even if hackers steal your password through a\u00a0data breach or\u00a0phishing attack, 2FA can stop them from accessing your accounts. That's why security experts strongly recommend enabling it on email, banking, cloud storage and social media accounts.",
      "It may take a few extra seconds to log in, but 2FA can prevent identity theft and unauthorized access, making it one of the most powerful security tools available.",
      "Extra security tip:Strong passwords and two-factor authentication work best together. If remembering complex passwords or managing one-time codes feels overwhelming, a secure password manager can generate, store and autofill strong passwords safely.",

      "HACKERS ABUSE GOOGLE CLOUD TO SEND TRUSTED PHISHING EMAILS",
      "4) VPN (Virtual Private Network)",
      "Hiding your online activity",
      "A VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, masking your IP address and protecting your online activity from outsiders.",
      "VPNs are especially important when using public Wi-Fi at airports, hotels or coffee shops, where cybercriminals can intercept unprotected data. They also help limit tracking by advertisers and internet service providers.",
      "While a VPN doesn't make you completely anonymous online, it adds a valuable layer of privacy and security, especially when browsing, shopping or accessing sensitive accounts.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "5) Cross-app tracking",
      "How companies follow you across apps",
      "Cross-app tracking lets advertisers and data brokers link your activity across multiple apps and websites. That data is used to build detailed profiles based on what you do, buy and watch.",
      "On\u00a0iPhone, this tracking is controlled by Apple's App Tracking Transparency system.On\u00a0Android, it relies on advertising IDs and ad personalization controls.",

      "Covenant Health detected suspicious activity in late May 2025, but investigators later confirmed attackers had already accessed systems days earlier. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What happened in the Covenant Health breach",
      "Covenant Health says it detected unusual activity in its IT environment May 26, 2025. A later investigation revealed that an attacker had actually gained access eight days earlier, on May 18, and was able to access patient data during that window.",
      "In July, Covenant Health told regulators that the breach affected 7,864 individuals. After completing what it describes as extensive data analysis, the organization now says that up to 478,188 individuals may have been affected.",
      "Covenant Health operates hospitals, nursing and rehabilitation centers, assisted living residences and elder care organizations across New England and parts of Pennsylvania. That wide footprint means the breach potentially touched patients across multiple states and care settings.",
      "In late June, the Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, Bleeping Computer reported. The group alleged it stole 852 GB of data, totaling nearly 1.35 million files. Covenant Health has not confirmed those figures, but it did acknowledge that patient information was accessed.",
      "According to the organization, the exposed data may have included names, addresses, dates of birth, medical record numbers, Social Security numbers, health insurance details and treatment information such as diagnoses, dates of treatment and types of care received.",
      "700CREDIT DATA BREACH EXPOSES SSNS OF 5.8M CONSUMERS",
      "Qilin ransomware lists Covenant Health on its data leak site. (Bleeping Computer)",
      "What Covenant Health is telling patients",
      "In a notice sent to regulators and patients, Covenant Health says it engaged third-party forensic specialists to investigate the incident and determine what data was involved. The organization says its data analysis is ongoing as it continues identifying individuals whose information may have been involved.",
      "Then there are the familiar statements every company makes after a breach, claiming they've strengthened the security of their IT systems to help prevent similar incidents in the future. Covenant Health says it has also set up a dedicated toll-free call center to handle questions related to the breach.",
      "Beginning Dec. 31, 2025, the organization started mailing notification letters to patients whose information may have been compromised. For individuals whose Social Security numbers may have been involved, Covenant Health is offering complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",
      "We reached out to Covenant Health, and the company confirmed the expanded scope of the incident and outlined steps being taken to notify patients and enhance security safeguards.",
      "DATA BREACH EXPOSES 400K BANK CUSTOMERS\u2019 INFO",
      "The breach exposed highly sensitive information, including names, Social Security numbers, medical records and treatment details tied to nearly half a million patients. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to protect yourself after the Covenant Health breach",
      "If you received a notice from Covenant Health, or if your data has been exposed in any healthcare breach, these steps can help reduce the risk of misuse.",
      "If the organization offers you credit monitoring or identity protection, take it. These services can alert you to suspicious activity tied to your Social Security number, credit file or identity details before real damage is done. If you're not offered one and want to be on the safer side, you might consider getting one yourself.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com",
      "Medical identity theft often shows up quietly. Review an explanation of benefits (EOBs), insurance claims and billing statements for services you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it to your insurer immediately.",
      "A fraud alert tells lenders to take extra steps to verify your identity before approving credit. A credit freeze goes further by blocking new accounts entirely unless you lift it. If Social Security numbers were exposed, a freeze is usually the safer option.",
      "To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Healthcare breaches often lead to credential-stuffing attacks elsewhere. A password manager ensures every account uses a unique password, so one exposed dataset can't unlock everything else. It also makes it easier to update passwords quickly after a breach.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Breaches are frequently followed by phishing emails, texts or calls that reference the incident to sound legitimate. Attackers may pose as the healthcare provider, an insurer or a credit bureau. Don't click links or share information unless you verify the source independently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Once your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites. Personal data removal services help reduce your digital footprint by requesting takedowns from these databases. While they can't erase everything, they lower your exposure and make targeted fraud harder.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "You're entitled to free credit reports from all major bureaus. Check them for unfamiliar accounts, hard inquiries or address changes. Catching fraud early makes it far easier to contain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Healthcare organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminal groups because of the volume and sensitivity of the data they store. Medical records contain a mix of personal, financial and health information that is difficult to change once exposed. Unlike a password, you cannot reset a diagnosis or treatment history. This breach also shows how early disclosures often underestimate impact. Large healthcare networks rely on complex systems and third-party vendors, which can slow forensic analysis in the early stages. As investigations continue, the number of affected individuals often climbs.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Grok, the built-in chatbot on X, is facing intense scrutiny after acknowledging it generated and shared an AI image depicting two young girls in sexualized attire.",
      "In a public post on X, Grok admitted the content \"violated ethical standards\" and \"potentially U.S. laws on child sexual abuse material (CSAM).\" The chatbot added, \"It was a failure in safeguards, and I'm sorry for any harm caused. xAI is reviewing to prevent future issues.\"",
      "That admission alone is alarming. What followed revealed a far broader pattern.",

      "OPENAI TIGHTENS AI RULES FOR TEENS BUT CONCERNS REMAIN",
      "The fallout from this incident has triggered global scrutiny, with governments and safety groups questioning whether AI platforms are doing enough to protect children.\u00a0 (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Grok quietly restricts image tools to paying users after backlash",
      "As criticism mounted, Grok confirmed it has begun limiting image generation and editing features to paying subscribers only. In a late-night reply on X, the chatbot stated that image tools are now locked behind a premium subscription, directing users to sign up to regain access.",
      "The apology that raised more questions",
      "Grok's apology appeared only after a user prompted the chatbot to write a heartfelt explanation for people lacking context. In other words, the system did not proactively address the issue. It responded because someone asked it to.",
      "Around the same time, researchers and journalists uncovered widespread misuse of Grok's image tools. According to monitoring firm Copyleaks, users were generating nonconsensual, sexually manipulated images of real women, including minors and well-known figures.",
      "After reviewing Grok's publicly accessible photo feed, Copyleaks identified a conservative rate of roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute, based on images involving real people with no clear indication of consent. The firm says the misuse escalated quickly, shifting from consensual self-promotion to large-scale harassment enabled by AI.",
      "Copyleaks CEO and co-founder Alon Yamin said, \"When AI systems allow the manipulation of real people's images without clear consent, the impact can be immediate and deeply personal.\"",
      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "Grok admitted it generated and shared an AI image that violated ethical standards and may have broken U.S. child protection laws. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Sexualized images of minors are illegal",
      "This is not a gray area. Generating or distributing sexualized images of minors is a serious criminal offense in the United States and many other countries. Under U.S. federal law, such content is classified as child sexual abuse material. Penalties can include five to 20 years in prison, fines up to $250,000 and mandatory sex offender registration. Similar laws apply in the U.K. and France.",
      "In 2024, a Pennsylvania man received nearly eight years in prison for creating and possessing deepfake CSAM involving child celebrities. That case set a clear precedent. Grok itself acknowledged this legal reality in its post, stating that AI images depicting minors in sexualized contexts are illegal.",
      "The scale of the problem is growing fast",
      "A July report from the Internet Watch Foundation, a nonprofit that tracks and removes child sexual abuse material online, shows how quickly this threat is accelerating. Reports of AI-generated child sexual abuse imagery jumped by 400% in the first half of 2025 alone. Experts warn that AI tools lower the barrier to potential abuse. What once required technical skill or access to hidden forums can now happen through a simple prompt on a mainstream platform.",
      "Real people are being targeted",
      "The harm is not abstract. Reuters documented cases where users asked Grok to digitally undress real women whose photos were posted on X. In multiple documented cases, Grok fully complied. Even more disturbing, users targeted images of a 14-year-old actress Nell Fisher from the Netflix series \"Stranger Things.\" Grok later admitted there were isolated cases in which users received images depicting minors in minimal clothing. In another Reuters investigation, a Brazilian musician described watching AI-generated bikini images of herself spread across X after users prompted Grok to alter a harmless photo. Her experience mirrors what many women and girls are now facing.",
      "Governments respond worldwide",
      "The backlash has gone global. In France, multiple ministers referred X to an investigative agency over possible violations of the EU's Digital Services Act, which requires platforms to prevent and mitigate the spread of illegal content. Violations can trigger heavy fines. In India, the country's IT ministry gave xAI 72 hours to submit a report detailing how it plans to stop the spread of obscene and sexually explicit material generated by Grok. Grok has also warned publicly that xAI could face potential probes from the Department of Justice or lawsuits tied to these failures.",

      "Researchers later found Grok was widely used to create nonconsensual, sexually altered images of real women, including minors. (Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Concerns grow over Grok's safety and government use",
      "The incident raises serious concerns about online privacy, platform security and the safeguards designed to protect minors.",
      "Elon Musk, the owner of X and founder of xAI, had not offered a public response at the time of publication. That silence comes at a sensitive time. Grok has been authorized for official government use under an 18-month federal contract. This approval was granted despite objections from more than 30 consumer advocacy groups that warned the system lacked proper safety testing.",
      "Over the past year, Grok has been accused by critics of spreading misinformation about major news events, promoting antisemitic rhetoric and sharing misleading health information. It also competed directly with tools like ChatGPT and Gemini while operating with fewer visible safety restrictions. Each controversy raises the same question. Can a powerful AI tool be deployed responsibly without strong oversight and enforcement?",
      "What parents and users should know",
      "If you encounter sexualized images of minors or other abusive material online, report it immediately. In the United States, you can contact the FBI tip line or seek help from the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children.",
      "Do not download, share, screenshot or interact with the content in any way. Even viewing or forwarding illegal material can expose you to serious legal risk.",
      "Parents should also talk with children and teens about AI image tools and social media prompts. Many of these images are created through casual requests that do not feel dangerous at first. Teaching kids to report content, close the app and tell a trusted adult can stop harm from spreading further.",
      "Platforms may fail. Safeguards may lag. But early reporting and clear conversations at home remain one of the most effective ways to protect children online.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Grok scandal highlights a dangerous reality. As AI spreads faster, these systems amplify harm at an unprecedented scale. When safeguards fail, real people suffer, and children face serious risk. At the same time, trust cannot depend on apologies issued after harm occurs. Instead, companies must earn trust through strong safety design, constant monitoring and real accountability when problems emerge.",

    "published": "Fri, 09 Jan 2026 07:30:30 -0500",
    "summary": "CES 2026 unveiled game-changing tech from LG&apos;s invisible wallpaper TV to AI-powered home robots and foldable steering wheels for autonomous cars.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Every January, the Consumer Electronics Show, better known as CES, takes over Las Vegas. It's where tech companies show off what they're building next, from products that are almost ready to buy to ideas that feel pulled from the future.",
      "CES 2026 was packed with moments that made people stop and stare. Some of the tech felt practical. Some of it felt a bit wild. However, these 10 showstoppers were the ones everyone kept talking about on the show floor.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you'll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "1) LG Wallpaper TV",
      "LG pushed TV design to the edge of invisibility once again at CES 2026. The latest Wallpaper TV, officially called the LG OLED evo W6, is just 9mm thin and sits completely flush against the wall. From the side, it looks more like glass than a television.",
      "This version feels far more practical than earlier Wallpaper models. All inputs live in a separate Zero Connect Box, which wirelessly sends visually lossless 4K video and audio to the screen from up to 30 feet away. That keeps cables out of sight and gives you more freedom when placing the TV.",
      "THIS EV HAS A FACE, AND IT TALKS BACK WITH AI",
      "The LG CLOiD robot and the LG OLED evo AI Wallpaper TV are displayed onstage during an LG Electronics news conference at CES 2026, an annual consumer electronics trade show, in Las Vegas, Jan. 5, 2026. (REUTERS/Steve Marcus)",
      "Picture quality also takes a major step forward. LG's new Hyper Radiant Color Technology boosts brightness, improves color accuracy and deepens blacks while cutting screen reflections. With Brightness Booster Ultra, the Wallpaper TV reaches up to 3.9 times the brightness of conventional OLEDs and stays easy to watch even in bright rooms.",
      "Powering it all is LG's new Alpha 11 AI Processor Gen3. Its upgraded Dual AI Engine preserves natural detail while reducing noise, avoiding the overly sharp look that plagues some high-end TVs. Gamers also get plenty to like, including 4K at up to 165Hz, ultra-fast response times and support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and AMD FreeSync Premium.",
      "Availability: Expected later in 2026 through select retailers.",
      "2) Dreame Cyber X Stair-Climbing Robot Vacuum",
      "Dreame showed plenty of power at CES 2026, but the real jaw-dropper was the Cyber X concept. This robot vacuum uses a four-legged base that lets it climb stairs on its own, turning multi-level cleaning into something that finally feels automated.",
      "The design looks unusual at first, almost like a robot pet. Once it starts moving, though, the idea clicks. A built-in water tank reduces trips back to the dock, which should help extend cleaning sessions and preserve battery life.",
      "Dreame\u2019s Cyber X concept uses a four-legged design to climb stairs on its own, hinting at a new era of autonomous home robots. (Dreame)",
      "It's still a concept, but Cyber X feels like a glimpse at where home robots are headed. Less rolling around. More real autonomy.",
      "Availability: Concept product.",
      "3) SwitchBot AI MindClip",
      "SwitchBot joined the growing AI wearable trend with the MindClip, a tiny device designed to act like a second brain. It clips on easily, weighs just 18 grams and stays out of the way while quietly doing its job.",
      "MindClip can record conversations and meetings, summarize calls and create AI-powered notes. It also supports more than 100 languages, making it useful for work, travel or multilingual households. Like similar devices, it lets you listen back to recordings and read transcriptions later.",
      "Where MindClip aims to stand out is in memory. SwitchBot says users will be able to search past recordings and track down important details it captured earlier, turning everyday conversations into a searchable archive. That could be especially helpful for busy professionals and students who juggle calls, classes and meetings.",
      "The tiny MindClip clips on discreetly while recording, transcribing and organizing conversations using AI. (SwitchBot)",
      "Details are still limited, and no pricing has been announced. SwitchBot has hinted that many key features will require a subscription, which puts it in line with competing AI wearables.",
      "Availability: Not yet available. Pricing and preorder details have not been released.",
      "4) LG CLOiD Home Robot",
      "LG didn't just show off a concept robot at CES. It showed a glimpse of what a true AI-powered home might look like.",
      "At LG Electronics' booth at CES 2026, the company unveiled LG CLOiD, a home robot designed to handle real household chores as part of its \"Zero Labor Home\" vision. This isn't just a rolling assistant. CLOiD can fold laundry, help in the kitchen and move safely around furniture.",
      "The robot uses a stable, wheeled base inspired by robot vacuums, paired with a tilting torso and two articulated arms. Each arm has human-like movement and individual fingers, allowing CLOiD to grip, lift and place objects with surprising precision. In demos, it retrieved items from the fridge, loaded an oven and folded clothes after a laundry cycle.",
      "CLOiD's head acts as a mobile AI home hub, using cameras, sensors and voice-based AI to understand routines and control LG's ThinQ-connected appliances. It still feels futuristic and a little unsettling, but the technology behind it is hard to ignore. If LG can make it practical and affordable, CLOiD could mark a real step toward AI doing the housework for us.",
      "Availability: Concept and research-stage technology. Not planned for consumer sale at this time.",
      "5) Glyde Smart Hair Clippers",
      "Glyde is trying to solve one of the most frustrating parts of grooming: cutting your own hair without messing it up.",
      "The company introduced AI-powered smart hair clippers designed to guide the cut for you. You wear a simple headband that marks where a fade should start, choose a style in the app and let the clippers do the rest. Built-in sensors track your speed, angle and movement in real time, automatically adjusting the blade to keep cuts even and fades smooth.",
      "This is very much a trust exercise. You're letting software guide sharp blades near your head, and that won't be for everyone. But for people who skip the barber, hate appointments or just want a quick cleanup at home, the idea makes sense.",
      "Glyde's system is built to be \"mistake-proof.\" Move too fast, and the blade retracts. Tilt it the wrong way, and it trims less. Popular styles like buzz cuts, crew cuts and side parts are baked into the app, with step-by-step guidance that adapts as you cut.",
      "It's a one-time investment meant to replace repeat barber visits. If it works as promised, Glyde could turn haircuts into a 10-minute task you do on your own schedule.",
      "Availability: Limited early access or direct sales may come later in 2026.",
      "6) LEGO Smart Bricks",
      "LEGO is adding a digital twist to its classic bricks, and surprisingly, it works. At CES, LEGO introduced LEGO Smart Play, a new line built around \"Smart Bricks\" that look like regular LEGO pieces but hide sensors, LEDs and speakers inside. The bricks can detect movement, distance and interaction, lighting up, changing color and producing sound effects in real time as kids play.",
      "The launch leans heavily into Star Wars, including sets with Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, an X-Wing and a TIE fighter. In one demo, a Luke minifigure produced its own lightsaber sounds. In another, bricks made swooshing and crashing noises when attached to vehicles, while figures reacted when they were \"hit.\" It felt playful, immersive and instantly understandable.",
      "A LEGO piece with a smart brick attached is displayed during a LEGO news conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 5, 2026, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Abbie Parr)",
      "Smart Tags snap into the bricks to control different behaviors, and a quick shake wakes everything up. Pricing starts around $70 and climbs to about $160, with Star Wars sets arriving in March. LEGO hasn't shared details on battery life yet, but the goal is clear: add interactivity without pushing kids toward screens.",
      "This feels like LEGO doing tech the right way. You still build with your hands, imagine the story and snap bricks together. The technology simply brings the play to life.",
      "Availability: Launching March 2026. Expected to be sold through LEGO and major retailers.",
      "7) Autoliv Foldable Steering Wheel",
      "This might look like a small change, but it could completely reshape future car interiors.",
      "Autoliv unveiled the world's first foldable steering wheel designed for Level 4 autonomous vehicles. When the car switches into self-driving mode, the steering wheel retracts smoothly into the dashboard, opening up the cabin and giving occupants more space to relax, work or just stretch out.",
      "What makes this impressive is that safety isn't sacrificed. Autoliv built an adaptive airbag system that changes with the driving mode. When you're driving manually, the airbag lives in the steering wheel as usual. Once the wheel folds away in autonomous mode, a separate airbag in the instrument panel takes over, keeping protection intact at all times.",
      "It's a smart, practical solution to a problem automakers are already facing. If cars don't always need a steering wheel, why should it always be in the way? Autoliv's design shows how autonomy isn't just about software, it's about rethinking the entire cabin experience.",
      "Availability: Automotive supplier technology for future vehicles.",
      "8) TDM Neo Hybrid Headphones",
      "These might be the most interesting headphones at CES for one simple reason: they refuse to stay just headphones.",
      "Tomorrow Doesn't Matter, better known as TDM, unveiled Neo, a premium on-ear 2-in-1 hybrid headphone that physically twists into a compact Bluetooth speaker. No docking. No accessories. Just a quick rotation, and your personal audio turns into shared sound. Amazing, right?",
      "The concept might sound a bit gimmicky, but the execution feels solid. The hinge mechanism is sturdy, the transformation is intuitive, and the idea makes a lot of sense in real life. You can listen privately on a train, then flip Neo into speaker mode the moment you meet up with friends.",
      "TDM describes this as going from \"solo to social,\" and that's exactly the appeal. It blurs the line between headphones and portable speakers in a way we haven't really seen before. For travelers, outdoor users, or anyone who hates carrying multiple audio devices, Neo could be a genuinely very useful hybrid device.",
      "Availability: TDM will be launching Neo on Kickstarter later this month and will begin shipping in July.",
      "9) Jackery Solar Mars Bot",
      "Jackery made waves at CES with the Solar Mars Bot, a mobile solar generator that can move, track sunlight and recharge itself without constant setup.",
      "The Solar Mars Bot uses AI-enhanced computer vision to navigate on its own, follow its user and reposition throughout the day to capture the strongest available sunlight. Instead of manually adjusting panels or relocating gear, the system handles those decisions automatically. When not in use, its solar panels fold and retract, which helps make storage and transport more practical.",
      "What sets this system apart is how it blends mobility with energy storage. Unlike fixed solar installations that stay in one place or portable generators that must be carried and recharged by hand, the Solar Mars Bot actively manages its own power intake. It tracks the sun, recharges itself using solar energy and delivers power where it is needed.",
      "That makes it especially useful for extended power outages, off-grid living, emergency backup and outdoor adventures where access to electricity can change throughout the day. The Solar Mars Bot shows how portable power can become more intelligent, adaptable and hands-off when conditions are unpredictable.",
      "Availability: Prototype showcased at CES.",
      "10) Timeli Personal Safety Device",
      "Timeli grabbed a lot of attention at CES 2026 with a simple, immediate approach to personal safety. By combining a flashlight, HD video recording, a loud alarm, GPS tracking and live emergency dispatch into one handheld device, it earned a CES 2026 Innovation Awards Honoree and plenty of interest on the show floor.",
      "Instead of opening an app or tapping through menus, Timeli relies on muscle memory. A quick press turns on a powerful flashlight and starts recording video. If a situation escalates, pressing and holding the SOS button triggers a full safety sequence. The alarm sounds, live video begins streaming, GPS coordinates lock in and two-way communication connects directly to emergency dispatch over cellular service.",
      "That live connection matters. Timeli works with RapidSOS to give dispatchers real-time video and location data. This added clarity helps responders understand what is happening faster and send the right help sooner. Studies show video verified emergencies can cut response times dramatically, while also reducing false alarms.",
      "Timeli works even without a phone. Built-in cellular, GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth allow it to operate on its own or alongside the companion app for iOS and Android. Users can adjust video quality, light brightness and alarm volume to match their needs. Cloud video storage and alerts add another layer of reassurance.",
      "WORLD'S THINNEST AI GLASSES FEATURE BUILT-IN AI ASSISTANT",
      "The design stays practical. Timeli is about the size and weight of a smartphone, so it fits easily in a pocket, purse or backpack. Battery life supports long standby time, extended daily use and several hours of active protection. It even doubles as a power bank, while reserving enough charge to stay ready for emergencies.",
      "Availability:\u00a0Priced at $249 for preorder through timeli.com. Timeli includes a year of professional monitoring before transitioning to a monthly subscription.",
      "Honorable mentions: CES 2026 products worth checking out",
      "These products also stood out on the CES 2026 show floor, highlighting smart design choices and meaningful innovation that point to the future of consumer tech.",
      "ASUS reimagined portable productivity with the 2026 Zenbook Duo. This laptop snaps two 14-inch 3K ASUS Lumina OLED touchscreens together into a single mobile workstation you can carry with one hand.",
      "The dual-screen setup lets you keep a main project open on one display while chats, calls or reference material live on the other. That alone cuts down on constant app switching. The OLED panels deliver rich color, deep blacks, smooth motion and built-in eye care that makes long sessions easier on your eyes.",
      "ASUS also upgraded what you hear. A new six-speaker system replaces the previous two-speaker design, creating fuller, more immersive audio for movies, music, and calls. Everything is wrapped in a Ceraluminum ceramic finish that resists fingerprints and scratches while feeling premium in hand.",
      "Availability: Expected early 2026. Pricing has not been announced.",
      "SpotOn focused on precision and reliability with the launch of the SpotOn GPS Fence Nova Edition. This is a GPS dog fence system designed to create virtual fences anywhere, from small yards to massive rural properties, with no subscription required.",
      "What sets Nova apart is its advanced antenna and receiver system. SpotOn uses a dual-band, dual-feed active antenna paired with a dual-band receiver that reduces GPS drift by up to 40% and delivers accuracy up to eight times better than competing systems. In third-party testing, it achieved 100% reliable containment.",
      "Owners can create unlimited fences by walking boundaries, drawing them in the app, or placing GPS fenceposts automatically. The collar also includes intelligent audio cues, optional static correction, custom voice commands, LED prompts and sizing that grows with your dog. If a dog ever leaves the fence, tracking tools are available through the app or SpotOn support.",
      "Availability: Available in the US and Canada for $999.",
      "Lenovo took handheld gaming seriously with the Legion Go powered by SteamOS. This is the most powerful Legion handheld to ship natively with SteamOS, blending desktop-class performance with console-like simplicity.",
      "It features an 8.8-inch PureSight OLED display and can be configured with up to an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X memory, and up to 2TB of PCIe SSD storage with expansion via microSD. SteamOS is tuned for gamepad controls and quick access, with features like fast suspend and resume, cloud saves, Steam Chat and built-in game recording.",
      "The result feels less like a mini PC and more like a true console you can carry. You get instant access to your Steam library without juggling operating systems or launchers.",
      "Availability: On sale June 2026. Starting price is $1,199.",
      "SanDisk introduced a new internal drive brand at CES, and the Optimus GX 7100M is its first standout. Built for handheld gaming consoles and thin and light laptops, this PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD delivers speeds up to 7,250 MB per second.",
      "The drive is available in capacities up to 2TB, giving gamers faster load times, more room for large libraries and smoother performance on the go. It is designed for devices that support an M.2 2230 slot, including popular handheld consoles and compact laptops.",
      "This launch also marks the debut of the SanDisk Optimus name, which will replace the company's internal SSD lineup for gamers, creators and professionals moving forward.",
      "Availability: Expected early spring 2026. Pricing will be announced closer to release.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",
      "Think your devices and data are truly protected? Take this quick quiz to see where your digital habits stand. From passwords to Wi-Fi settings, you\u2019ll get a personalized breakdown of what you\u2019re doing right and what needs improvement. Take my Quiz here: Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CES 2026 made one thing clear. Tech companies are taking bigger swings than ever. Some of these products feel close to becoming part of everyday life. Others may stay experimental for years. That's what makes CES so fascinating. It gives us an early look at where technology could be headed and sparks conversations about what we actually want in our homes, cars and daily routines.",

      "The device clips onto a monitor, laptop or tablet and projects near-infrared light while you work, without adding noise or disrupting your routine.",
      "Near-infrared light is a natural component of sunlight linked to energy levels, mood and skin health. Sunbooster uses patented SunLED technology to deliver controlled exposure and tracks daily dosage, encouraging two to four hours of use during screen time.",
      "The technology has been tested in human and laboratory studies conducted at the University of Groningen and Maastricht University, adding scientific backing to its claims. The company is also developing a phone case and a monitor with built-in near-infrared lighting, which could make sunlight replacement even more seamless in indoor environments.",

      "Cybercriminals have found a clever new way to get phishing emails straight into inboxes.",
      "Instead of spoofing brands, they are abusing real cloud tools that people already trust. Security researchers say attackers recently hijacked a legitimate email feature inside Google Cloud.",
      "The result was thousands of phishing messages that looked and felt like normal Google notifications. Many slipped past spam filters with ease.",

      "How this Google Cloud phishing attack worked",
      "At the center of the campaign was Google Cloud Application Integration. This service allows businesses to send automated email notifications from workflows they build. Attackers exploited the Send Email task inside that system. Because the messages came from a real Google address, they appeared authentic to both users and security tools.",
      "According to Check Point, a global cybersecurity firm that tracks and analyzes large-scale threat campaigns, the emails were sent from a legitimate Google-owned address and closely matched Google's notification style. Fonts, wording, and layout all looked familiar. Over a two-week period in December 2025, attackers sent more than 9,000 phishing emails targeting roughly 3,200 organizations across the U.S., Europe, Canada, Asia Pacific, and Latin America.",
      "Attackers used trusted Google Cloud infrastructure to route victims through multiple redirects before revealing the scam. (Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)",
      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Why Google phishing emails were so convincing",
      "The messages looked like routine workplace alerts. Some claimed you had received a voicemail. Others said you were granted access to a shared document, like a Q4 file. That sense of normalcy lowered suspicion. Many people are used to seeing these exact messages every day. Even more concerning, the emails bypassed common protections like SPF and DMARC because they were sent through Google-owned infrastructure. To email systems, nothing looked fake.",
      "What happens after you click",
      "The attack did not stop at the email. Once a victim clicked the link, they were sent to a page hosted on storage.cloud.google.com. That added another layer of trust. From there, the link redirected again to googleusercontent.com. Next came a fake CAPTCHA or image check. This step blocked automated security scanners while letting real users continue. After passing that screen, victims landed on a fake Microsoft login page hosted on a non-Microsoft domain. Any credentials entered there were captured by the attackers.",
      "Who was targeted in the Google Cloud phishing attack",
      "Check Point says the campaign focused heavily on industries that rely on automated alerts and shared documents. That included manufacturing, technology, finance, professional services, and retail. Other sectors like healthcare, education, government, energy, travel and media were also targeted. These environments see constant permission requests and file-sharing notices, which made the lures feel routine.",
      "\"We have blocked several phishing campaigns involving the misuse of an email notification feature within Google Cloud Application Integration,\" a Google spokesperson told Cyberguy. \"Importantly, this activity stemmed from the abuse of a workflow automation tool, not a compromise of Google\u2019s infrastructure. While we have implemented protections to defend users against this specific attack, we encourage continued caution as malicious actors frequently attempt to spoof trusted brands. We are taking additional steps to prevent further misuse.\"",
      "The incident demonstrates how attackers can weaponize legitimate cloud automation tools without resorting to traditional spoofing.",
      "Ways to stay safe from trusted-looking phishing emails",
      "Phishing emails are getting harder to spot, especially when attackers abuse real cloud platforms like Google Cloud. These steps help reduce risk when emails look familiar and legitimate.",
      "Attackers rely on urgency. Messages about voicemails, shared files or permission changes are designed to make you click fast. Pause before taking action. Ask yourself whether you were actually expecting that alert. If not, verify it another way.",
      "Always hover over links to preview the destination domain. In this campaign, links jumped across multiple trusted-looking Google domains before landing on a fake login page. If the final destination does not match the service asking you to sign in, close the page immediately.",
      "Shared document alerts are a favorite lure because they feel routine at work. If an email claims you were granted access to a file you do not recognize, do not click directly from the message. Instead, open your browser and sign in to Google Drive or OneDrive manually to check for new files.",
      "The final step led users to a fake Microsoft login page, where entered credentials were silently stolen. (Stack Social)",
      "Password managers can be a strong last line of defense. They will not autofill credentials on fake Microsoft or Google login pages hosted on non-official domains. If your password manager refuses to fill in a login, that is a red flag worth paying attention to.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Modern antivirus tools do more than scan files. Many now detect malicious links, fake CAPTCHA pages, and credential harvesting sites in real time. Strong antivirus software can block phishing pages even after a click, which matters in multi-stage attacks like this one.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Phishing campaigns often succeed because attackers already know your email, employer or role. That information is commonly pulled from data broker sites. A data removal service helps remove your personal information from these databases, making it harder for attackers to craft convincing, targeted emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

    "summary": "Researchers create supercapacitors from waste PET plastic bottles that could power electric vehicles and electronics within 5 to 10 years.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Each year, billions of single-use plastic bottles end up in landfills or oceans. That waste problem keeps growing. Now, a new scientific breakthrough suggests those same bottles could help power your daily life.",
      "Researchers have developed a way to transform discarded plastic water bottles into high-performance energy storage devices called supercapacitors. The work focuses on PET plastic, short for polyethylene terephthalate, which is used in most beverage bottles.",
      "The research was published in Energy & Fuels and highlighted by the American Chemical Society. Scientists say the discovery could reduce plastic pollution while helping drive cleaner energy technology.",

      "SCIENTISTS EXTRACT SILVER FROM E-WASTE USING COOKING OIL",
      "Discarded PET water bottles are one of the most common sources of plastic waste worldwide, with hundreds of billions produced each year. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why PET plastic waste is such a growing problem",
      "PET plastic is everywhere. According to the researchers, more than 500 billion single-use PET plastic bottles are produced every year. Most are used once and thrown away. Lead researcher Dr. Yun Hang Hu says that scale creates a major environmental challenge.",
      "Instead of letting that plastic pile up, the team focused on upcycling it into something valuable. Their idea was simple but powerful. Turn waste into materials that support renewable energy systems and reduce production costs at the same time.",
      "NEW TECH RECOVERS 92% OF EV BATTERY METALS",
      "Those upcycled materials come together to form an all-waste-plastic supercapacitor designed for fast charging and long term energy storage. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How plastic bottles can store and release energy",
      "Imagine a device that can charge fast and deliver power instantly. That is exactly what supercapacitors do. They store and release energy much faster than traditional batteries, which makes them useful for electric vehicles, solar power systems and everyday electronics.",
      "Hu's team found a way to build these energy storage components using discarded PET plastic water bottles. By reshaping the plastic at extremely high temperatures, the researchers turned waste into materials that can generate electricity efficiently and repeatedly.",
      "Here is how the process works:",
      "For the electrodes, researchers cut PET bottles into tiny, grain-sized pieces. They mixed the plastic with calcium hydroxide and heated it to nearly 1,300 degrees Fahrenheit in a vacuum. That heat transformed the plastic into a porous, electrically conductive carbon powder.",
      "The powder was then formed into thin electrode layers. For the separator, small pieces of PET were flattened and carefully perforated with hot needles. This pattern allowed electric current to pass efficiently while maintaining safety and durability. Once assembled, the device used two carbon electrodes separated by the PET film and submerged in a potassium hydroxide electrolyte.",
      "CIGARETTE BUTTS MAKE ROADS STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE",
      "Researchers use extreme heat to convert waste PET plastic into porous carbon materials that can store and move electricity efficiently. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the results surprised scientists",
      "When tested, the all-waste-plastic supercapacitor outperformed similar devices made with traditional glass fiber separators. After repeated charging and discharging, it retained 79 percent of its energy capacity. A comparable glass fiber device retained 78 percent. That difference matters. The PET-based design costs less to produce, remains fully recyclable, and supports circular energy storage technologies where waste materials are reused instead of discarded.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This breakthrough could affect everyday life sooner than you might expect. Cheaper supercapacitors can lower the cost of electric vehicles, solar systems and portable electronics. Faster charging and longer device lifespans could follow. It also shows that sustainability does not require giving something up. Waste plastics could become part of the solution instead of the problem. Although this technology is still in development, the research team believes PET-based supercapacitors could reach commercial markets within 5 to 10 years. In the meantime, choosing reusable bottles and plastic-free alternatives still helps reduce waste today.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Turning trash into energy storage is more than a clever idea. It shows how science can tackle two global challenges at once. Plastic pollution continues to grow. Energy demand does too. This research proves that those problems do not have to be solved separately. By rethinking waste as a resource, scientists are building a cleaner and more efficient future from materials we already throw away.",

      "How fake error malware attacks actually work",
      "These attacks begin with a compromised website. When a visitor lands on the page, something looks wrong right away. Text appears broken. Fonts look scrambled. Visual elements seem corrupted. A pop-up then appears claiming the issue can be fixed with a browser update or a missing system font. A button offers to repair the problem instantly.",
      "Clicking that button copies a command to the clipboard and displays instructions to paste it into PowerShell or a system terminal. That single step launches the infection.",

      "Fake error popups make a website look broken by scrambling text or fonts to create urgency and panic. (Jens B\u00fcttner/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Why this new tool changes the threat landscape",
      "The tool behind these attacks is called ErrTraffic. It automates the entire process and removes the technical barriers that once limited cybercrime operations. For about $800, attackers get a full package with a control panel and scripted payload delivery. Analysts at the Hudson Rock Threat Intelligence Team identified the tool after tracking its promotion on Russian-language forums in early December 2025.",
      "ErrTraffic works through a simple JavaScript injection. A single line of code connects a hacked site to the attacker's dashboard. From there, everything adapts automatically. The script detects the operating system and browser. It then displays a customized fake error message in the correct language. The attack works across Windows, Android, macOS and Linux.",
      "MOST PARKED DOMAINS NOW PUSH SCAMS AND MALWARE",
      "The popups often claim a browser update or missing system font is needed to fix the problem. (Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Why security software struggles to stop it",
      "Traditional malware defenses look for suspicious downloads or unauthorized installations. ErrTraffic avoids both. Browsers see normal text copying. Security tools see a legitimate system utility being opened manually. Nothing appears out of place. That design allows the attack to slip through protections that would normally stop malware in its tracks.",
      "The success rate is deeply concerning",
      "Data pulled from active ErrTraffic campaigns shows conversion rates approaching 60%. That means more than half of the visitors who see the fake error message follow the instructions and install malware. Once active, the tool can deliver infostealers like Lumma or Vidar on Windows devices. Android targets often receive banking trojans instead. The control panel even includes geographic filtering, with built-in blocks for Russia and neighboring regions to avoid drawing attention from local authorities.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "Once malware is installed, credentials and session data are stolen. Those compromised logins are then used to breach additional websites. Each newly hacked site becomes another delivery vehicle for the same attack. That cycle allows the campaign to grow without direct involvement from the original operator.",

      "Legitimate websites never ask you to copy and paste commands into PowerShell or a system terminal. Fake error malware relies on convincing messages that pressure you into doing exactly that. If a page instructs you to run code to fix a problem, close it immediately.",
      "Fake error campaigns often use broken text, scrambled fonts or warnings about missing files to grab attention. As a result, these visuals create urgency and trigger fear. In reality, a real system problem never announces itself through a random website, so close the page right away.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Fake error malware works because it plays on a very human reaction. When something on a screen suddenly looks broken, most people want to fix it fast and move on. That split-second decision is exactly what attackers are counting on. Tools like ErrTraffic show how polished these scams have become. The messages look professional. The instructions feel routine. Nothing about the moment screams danger. But behind the scenes, one click can quietly hand over passwords, banking access and personal data. The good news is that slowing down makes a real difference. Closing a suspicious page and trusting built-in system updates can stop these attacks cold. When it comes to pop-ups claiming your device is broken, walking away is often the smartest fix.",

      "Researchers, however, uncovered a long-running malware operation that abused that trust on a massive scale. Koi Security analysts identified the threat while analyzing suspicious infrastructure tied to a campaign known as ShadyPanda. What started as one investigation quickly revealed something far larger.",
      "The group behind it is now known as DarkSpectre. According to Koi researchers, it infected more than 8.8 million users across Chrome, Edge and Firefox over seven years. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It was slow, deliberate and highly organized. Instead of rushing malicious code into marketplaces, the group played the long game.",

      "MALICIOUS CHROME EXTENSIONS CAUGHT STEALING SENSITIVE DATA",
      "Security researchers say millions of users unknowingly installed browser extensions that later turned malicious after years of appearing legitimate. (Donato Fasano/Getty Images)",
      "One threat actor behind three major campaigns",
      "At first, the activity looked like separate threats. That changed once Koi analysts followed the infrastructure breadcrumbs. By pivoting from domains linked to ShadyPanda, Koi researchers uncovered shared systems powering multiple extension clusters. That analysis confirmed that ShadyPanda, GhostPoster and Zoom Stealer were not separate actors. They were one coordinated operation. Together, these campaigns targeted both everyday users and corporate environments.",
      "This campaign focused on mass surveillance and affiliate fraud. Researchers estimate it affected\u00a0more than 4 million users, with some analyses suggesting the total could reach up to 5.6 million as additional related extensions were linked. In several cases, extensions remained legitimate for more than five years before quietly turning malicious.",
      "This campaign used a clever trick. It hid malicious code inside image files to bypass security checks. It impacted 1.05 million users.",
      "This operation targeted corporate meeting data across more than 28 conferencing platforms. It affected 2.2 million users.",
      "Different goals. Same operator.",
      "How Koi uncovered DarkSpectre's hidden network",
      "The breakthrough came when Koi analysts examined two domains tied to ShadyPanda. Those domains powered legitimate extension features like weather widgets and new tab pages. They were not command servers. That was the trick. Those same clean domains appeared again and again across other extensions that quietly connected to entirely different malicious infrastructure.",
      "One domain led to extensions. Those extensions exposed new domains. Those domains were connected to even more extensions. Following that chain allowed Koi to uncover over 100 connected extensions across multiple browser marketplaces. Some extensions even reused infrastructure already flagged in earlier investigations. That overlap confirmed DarkSpectre was operating at a nation-state scale.",
      "How DarkSpectre stayed hidden for years",
      "DarkSpectre succeeded by blending legitimate functionality with hidden malware. Users got what they expected. Meanwhile, the threat ran quietly in the background.",
      "Some extensions waited days before activating malicious behavior. Others triggered malware on only a small percentage of page loads. This made detection during marketplace reviews extremely difficult.",
      "The group hid JavaScript inside PNG image files. The extension loaded its own logo, extracted the hidden code and executed it silently.",
      "Instead of pushing new extension versions, DarkSpectre controlled everything from its servers. Operators could change behavior anytime without alerting users or marketplaces. Koi researchers noted this approach gave the attackers long-term flexibility and control.",
      "Why the Zoom Stealer campaign stands out",
      "Most malware focuses on consumer fraud. Zoom Stealer focused on intelligence.",
      "According to Koi analysts, these extensions collected the following:",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwordsMeeting IDs, topics and schedulesSpeaker names, titles, bios and photosCompany affiliations and branding",
      "Meeting links with embedded passwords",
      "Meeting IDs, topics and schedules",
      "Speaker names, titles, bios and photos",
      "Company affiliations and branding",
      "Worse yet, the data streamed in real time. The moment a user joined or viewed a meeting, the information flowed out. This type of data enables phishing impersonation and corporate espionage at scale.",
      "Why browser extensions remain a weak link",
      "Extension marketplaces typically evaluate code only at submission or update. Koi's investigation shows how attackers exploit that model. Once an extension earns trust badges and positive reviews, users stop questioning it. That trust becomes a weapon. A clean extension today can become a threat tomorrow.",
      "Ways to stay safe from malicious browser extensions",
      "You do not need to avoid extensions entirely. You do need to stay cautious.",
      "Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it.",
      "Remove anything you no longer use. Fewer extensions reduce risk. CyberGuy has step-by-step guides showing how to review and remove browser extensions safely, making it easy to clean up your browser in just a few minutes. In Chrome, Edge and Firefox, open the\u00a0menu, go to\u00a0Extensions or Add-ons, and\u00a0remove anything you do not use or trust.",
      "Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "A long-running malware operation quietly abused trusted browser extensions across Chrome, Edge and Firefox, infecting millions worldwide. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Strong antivirus software can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "If your personal data was exposed in this security incident, it's crucial to act quickly to reduce your risk of identity theft and scams. A data removal service can help you remove all this personal information from the internet.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.",
      "It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag. Before installing, ask: \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension\u2019s been sold or hacked.",
      "If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via the browser's built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then, consider switching to a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Analysts uncovered a coordinated campaign that hid spyware inside everyday browser tools like new tab pages and translators. (Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "Subtle changes often appear before obvious damage. Sudden redirects, new tabs opening on their own, unfamiliar search results, popups, slower browsing or websites asking you to re-log in unexpectedly can all signal a malicious or compromised extension. Pay attention if ads appear where they never did before or if your browser settings change without your input.",
      "Koi's investigation shows how attackers rely on patience. Once an extension earns trust and sits quietly for years, users stop watching it. That makes small behavior changes easy to miss. If something feels off, do not ignore it. Disable extensions one by one to identify the culprit. If the issue disappears, remove that extension permanently.",
      "When in doubt, trust your instincts. Browsers should not surprise you.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "DarkSpectre is a reminder that online threats are getting smarter and quieter. This was not a smash-and-grab attack. It unfolded slowly, over years, and relied on trust most people never think twice about. Koi analysts connected the dots by tracking shared infrastructure across campaigns, but they also warn that some sleeper extensions may still be installed and trusted today. Browser extensions can be helpful, but every extra add-on is another door into your browser. Paying attention, cleaning house now and then, and questioning what you install can make a real difference.",

    "story": [
      "Conservative radio host and Seattle commentator Jason Rantz says declining to prosecute most drug cases could bring back disorder and violent crime.",
      "Seattle\u2019s new approach to drug enforcement is triggering alarm among police and public safety advocates, who warn the city is quietly sliding back toward the conditions that once fueled crime, open-air drug markets and deadly overdoses.",
      "City leaders last week pushed back against criticism that they had effectively stopped prosecuting drug users, saying there had been no formal policy change. The clarification came in an email from the Seattle Police Department, which said officers were still expected to enforce drug laws despite an internal communication that sparked backlash.",
      "\"There has been no policy change,\" new Seattle Mayor Katie Wilson previously said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"You\u2019ll know when I announce a policy change, because I\u2019ll announce a policy change.\"",
      "Critics, however, say the reality on the ground tells a different story.",

      "Andrea Suarez, founder of the nonprofit We Heart Seattle, which works with people experiencing homelessness and addiction, said the city's policies have created a \"safe place\" for drug addicts and criminals.",
      "\"It will trap people longer in the cycle of addiction, creating havoc in our communities as they survive off theft, by and large,\" she said.",
      "Conservative radio host and Seattle-based commentator Jason Rantz told Fox News Digital city officials are downplaying concerns by insisting nothing has changed, even as enforcement practices shift in practice.",
      "According to Rantz, the change did not originate with Wilson but with the Seattle City Attorney\u2019s Office, which he said has signaled prosecutors will decline to pursue most drug cases except those deemed \"egregious.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s de facto decriminalization,\" Rantz said, regardless of how city officials describe it. He warned that when officers believe arrests will not be charged, enforcement inevitably collapses. \"Officers aren\u2019t going to risk injury or their careers for arrests they know won\u2019t stick.\"",
      "Rantz said the city risks returning to conditions it has already experienced \u2014 widespread public drug use, open-air dealing and surging overdoses. He pointed to past diversion-based approaches that failed to deliver promised results, arguing Seattle is repeating a cycle with well-documented consequences.",

      "\"This isn\u2019t speculation,\" Rantz said. \"We\u2019ve already lived this.\"",
      "As a resident who lives and works in Seattle, Rantz said the effects are already felt daily. He described routinely encountering people actively using fentanyl or meth while walking his dog and said many residents, particularly downtown workers and small business owners, live with constant fear that city leaders dismiss.",
      "That fear, he said, is not unfounded. Rantz cited a recent attack on an elderly woman who was struck in the face with a board containing a nail, leaving her blind. The suspect has a long criminal history but remained on the streets.",

      "\"These crimes are random,\" Rantz said. \"It can happen to anyone \u2014 a tourist, a worker, someone just going to a doctor\u2019s appointment.\"",
      "Rantz also warned the shift could worsen Seattle\u2019s ongoing police staffing crisis. City leaders said last year that the department was 260 officers short, KOMO News reported.",
      "\"If cops can\u2019t police, they won\u2019t stay,\" Rantz said, warning retirements and resignations could push the department toward dysfunction.",

      "\"The first victims are the homeless and drug-addicted individuals themselves,\" he said. \"Instead of getting help, they\u2019re being emboldened to continue habits that will kill them \u2014 while the rest of the city pays the price in crime and disorder.\"",

      "Suarez told Fox News Digital that diverting offenders away from prosecution removes a critical point of accountability.",
      "\"Not prosecuting for possession and public consumption and instead diverting to Community Court or the LEAD program simply removes rock bottom for an addict,\" Suarez said.",
      "She questioned what actually happens after an officer decides to arrest someone or divert them, arguing the process remains unclear years after diversion programs were introduced.",
      "\"Nobody can explain what the system within the system is once an officer decides to arrest or hand off to LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion),\" Suarez said. \"It is 2026, and we still do not have answers on how this proclaimed, award-winning, evidence-based program is better than sweating it out in jail.\"",

      "Suarez warned that diversion without consequences can trap people in addiction and fuel property crime. She also argued Seattle\u2019s permissive approach has turned the city into a magnet for drug activity.",
      "\"Seattle has been and seems to forever be a safe place for drug addicts and criminals to come to easily score and use drugs and avoid accountability,\" Suarez said. \"It is why our homeless numbers never improve.\"",

      "The Seattle Police Officers Guild also weighed in, releasing a statement from President Mike Solan sharply criticizing the city\u2019s direction. Solan described the decision to limit arrests for open drug use as \"horrifically dangerous\" and warned it would lead to \"more death and societal decay.\"",
      "\"This is commonly referred to as \u2018suicidal empathy,\u2019\" Solan said. He added that officers are reluctant to refer cases to diversion programs they believe are ineffective and said Seattle\u2019s streets have already shown the fallout from similar policies: \"death, decay, blight and crime.\"",
      "\"Now, with this resurrected insane direction, death, destruction and more human suffering will be supercharged,\" Solan warned.",
      "In response to concerns raised by police, advocates and residents, the Seattle Police Department said officers will continue enforcing drug laws and making arrests when they have probable cause, despite criticism that enforcement is being scaled back.",
      "\"Our mission remains the same and we are aligned with the City Attorney and Mayor\u2019s Office when it comes to keeping Seattle safe from dangerous drugs,\" a Seattle Police Department spokesperson said. \"Our officers will continue to make drug-related arrests if they have probable cause. They will also collaborate with prosecutors.\"",
      "The department said officers can flag cases where diversion may be ineffective and coordinate with prosecutors on other options, including prosecution.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Chief Shon Barnes reiterated that position in a recent message to officers, writing, \"Our mission remains unchanged, and we fully support programs and policies aimed at reducing recidivism and breaking the cycle of repeated criminal justice involvement.\"",
      "The Seattle City Attorney\u2019s Office said guidance that took effect January 1, 2026, directs most drug possession and public use cases to be reviewed for diversion before charges are filed.",
      "Under the memo, when an officer submits a report for knowing possession or public use, the case is first referred to the LEAD Liaison Team, which evaluates whether the individual has previously engaged with the program. If the person has refused or failed to meaningfully participate, prosecutors can consider other options.",
      "The guidance also allows officers or prosecutors to elevate cases involving \"unique, articulable circumstances\" for possible prosecution. In those situations, the Criminal Division Chief may consult with LEAD officials, prosecutors and the referring officer before making a final decision.",
      "Critics argue that while the policy preserves the possibility of prosecution, the default reliance on diversion could still discourage enforcement and leave neighborhoods dealing with increased disorder.",

Much of this output currently ends up in China.\"",
      "Ebus also described dire conditions inside mining zones. \"Mining districts are effectively run by criminal governance,\" he explained. \"Armed groups decide who can enter or leave an area, tax legal and illegal economic activity, and enforce their own form of justice.\" He also described how \"punishments for breaking rules can include expulsion, beatings, torture or death.\"",

Fox News correspondent Matt Finn captured a tense moment in downtown Minneapolis when a resident used a vehicle to briefly block Border Patrol agents during an active enforcement operation, forcing agents to order the driver to move.

The Islamic Republic has learned that detaining Americans and other Western nationals carries little cost and often produces tangible rewards \u2014 whether sanctions relief, access to frozen assets or asymmetric prisoner swaps. As long as this behavior is treated as a humanitarian problem rather than a coercive strategy, Tehran will continue to rely on hostage-taking as a core tool of statecraft.\"",

      "He continued, \"To reverse this pattern, the United States must impose consequences that are measurable, cumulative and irreversible. Every hostage-taking case should trigger automatic penalties: targeted sanctions on judges, prosecutors, interrogators, prison officials and intelligence officers involved; permanent confiscation \u2014 not escrow \u2014 of regime assets tied to hostage diplomacy; and coordinated diplomatic consequences with allies, including travel bans, removal of regime officials from international bodies and the pursuit of Interpol red notices where applicable. The message must be unambiguous: hostage-taking will leave the regime worse off, not better.\"",
      "Mohebbi urged that, \"The U.S. should formally designate Iran as a state that engages in hostage-taking, ban the use of U.S. passports for travel to or through Iran and maintain a public registry of regime officials involved in these crimes. At the same time, Washington must provide stronger, more transparent support to families of hostages and ensure sustained public naming and shaming. Only by raising the cost across legal, diplomatic, financial and reputational fronts can the United States begin to dismantle Iran\u2019s hostage-taking business,\" he said.",

      "\"Despite being supreme leader, one has to wonder, especially post-war and with limited public appearances, how much Khamenei is directly governing the affairs of the country,\" Ben Taleblu told Fox News Digital. He warned Western governments against backing a cosmetic transition that merely reshuffles elites.",
      "\"One thing I fear is the Western temptation for a Maduro-type or Egypt-type model,\" he said, referring to scenarios in which entrenched security forces retain power under new leadership. \"That will only be playing musical chairs at the top and will not provide the Iranian people a pathway for meaningful change.\"",

      "Ben Taleblu said the key factor is whether segments of the security forces defect, refuse orders or fragment. \"What has to be chipped away is the regime\u2019s coercive power,\" he said, adding that a transition would require sustained protests, economic strikes and cracks within security units.",
      "Without that, analysts warn, Iran could see a scenario in which clerical figureheads disappear but real power remains in the hands of armed institutions.",

      "While what happens next remains largely uncertain and multiple possibilities continue to be studied by Washington, the celebratory tones seen across the country and throughout the almost 9 million citizens in the diaspora on Saturday have largely subsided into muted and cautious joy only expressed in private circles among those who longed for an end to years of economic hardship and political repression.",
      "Vera, a professor at one of the better-known universities, told Fox News Digital, \"The world cannot fathom the joy we feel. Maduro is in a federal prison in the U.S. with living conditions and rights that our political prisoners never had.

      "Yet fear remains. The government has decreed any celebration of current events \u2014 and even expressions of approval of the U.S. operation in written text messages \u2014 to be a crime equivalent to national treason. Worse yet: it has empowered any law officer to check citizens and their telephones at random at hundreds of checkpoints established throughout Caracas and other regions of the country.",
      "Anyone found in violation of the decree can be immediately arrested without a trial, turning the promise of change into an anxiety-tempered state about what comes next and raising questions about sovereignty, daily survival and how to overcome yet another crisis.",

For safety reasons, he and other Venezuelans interviewed for this story requested either partial or complete anonymity due to the security situation.",

Hundreds of checkpoints have sprung up across Caracas since the decree forbidding any celebratory expression at the U.S. operation that captured Maduro. At the first few days, there were also pro-government publicly armed colectivos (state-sanctioned citizen collectivities) doing the rounds to capture and violently repress anyone so much as expressing relief that Maduro was gone. It\u2019s been extremely difficult having to remain vigilant at all times. From prior experiences, I learned to avoid most checkpoints through alternate ways and avoiding main roads. People have been sending texts saying where the checkpoints are and telling us to delete anything that shows our support for U.S. actions from our phones.\"",
      "He continued, \"For me, personally, it\u2019s a time of mixed feelings. I am relieved to see Maduro gone and finally see a promise or discourse by either local or foreign governments to come to pass in Venezuela. While I obviously understand this only happened because of foreign interference, I much prefer a U.S. action that ends this dictatorship than preserving Venezuela\u2019s sovereignty at the cost of our country. On the other hand, I am also frightened, because once you start dismantling the established structures, you end up having chaos, and in such a case, the population suffers the most.\"",
      "Jes\u00fas adds that he transits through three main large groups of people \u2014 his student friends, his family and older relatives and his job. He adds that among his friends the mood is largely of hope that the U.S. might reshape the Venezuelan market and develop it into what he calls a \"developed\" system, where people can actually lead a better life. \"We\u2019ll finally stop being a Cuban colony and either be truly independent or a U.S.-.led country like the Dominican Republic.

      "\"Finally, at work, there is apathy. I work in a rich neighborhood where lots of government officers and military people frequent. Obviously, police officers and other government officials who benefited from the corruption and criminality are against what happened, but most military personnel say they won\u2019t die for something they didn\u2019t sign up for because of a dictatorship. At my work, we\u2019ve seen so many broken promises, that we are only bracing to stay afloat,\" he concluded.",
      "For Hannah, a recent graduate, there\u2019s relief that Maduro is gone. \"Obviously, things shouldn\u2019t be like this, and Venezuelans should be the ones deciding the future of their own country, but Maduro had to leave one way or another, and now he is gone,\" she adds.",

      "\"In the more pragmatic business elite in Venezuela, there is a lot of hope that a more normal business environment will be created now that Maduro is gone and if the U.S. plays the regime-change and economy-development cards right, even if it is to favor themselves foremost. But even then, this would be a better environment for private businesses and an enormous market ripe for renovated activity.

I am very sorry that this happened in my country and would be lying if I said I agreed with foreign incursions, but I am also of the opinion that our own Armed Forces should have listened to the majority of the citizens in the 2024 elections [when Maduro retained power despite losing the vote], but they chose to continue oppressing their own people. This is, therefore, part of the cost we should pay for their inoperancy,\" she said.",

    "published": "Mon, 12 Jan 2026 16:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Many primate species have been observed engaging in same-sex sexual behavior. A new study suggests it likely developed evolutionarily to help reduce conflict and build bonds.",
    "story": [
      "Humans are far from the only primates engaging in same-sex sexual activity.",
      "A new study found instances in which 59 nonhuman primate species, including bonobos, chimpanzees and macaques, have taken part in same-sex behaviors.",
      "Researchers observed repeated occurrences of the behavior in 23 species. The study, published Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution, is the most comprehensive review of same-sex behavior in primates to date (though humans are not included). The findings challenge some common assumptions about the purpose of sex in the animal world, suggesting it plays a broader social role.",
      "The authors posit that same-sex behavior developed evolutionarily to help primates in complex social groups ease tension, reduce conflict and build bonds. A combination of genetics and external stress \u2014 from the environment or from social systems \u2014 appears to drive this behavior, they conclude.",
      "\u201cWhat we found shows that same-sex is not like something bizarre, aberrant or rare. It\u2019s everywhere, it\u2019s very useful, it\u2019s very important,\u201d said Vincent Savolainen, director of the Georgina Mace Centre for the Living Planet at Imperial College London and an author of the study.",
      "For the research, Savolainen and his co-authors analyzed existing data from previous research and observations of 491 primate species, looking for documented instances of same-sex sexual behavior.",
      "\u201cThis predominantly involved mounting, ventral-ventral or ventral-dorsal, as well as genital touching and fellatio. Both male-male and female-female interactions were included,\u201d the study says. Same-sex interactions of a nonsexual nature were not counted to avoid ambiguity.",
      "The resulting findings indicate that same-sex behavior is more common when animals need social cohesion to deal with harsh environmental conditions, when they\u2019re at high risk of being eaten or when competition for resources is more intense. It\u2019s also more common in social groups with strict hierarchies, where sex could help individuals manage competition, build alliances and avoid intergroup aggression.",
      "\u201cPeople haven\u2019t realized same-sex, as a behavior, is as important for the functioning of a society as feeding, fighting, making babies, looking after your offspring,\u201d Savolainen said.",
      "He likened same-sex sexual behavior to a \u201ccurrency\u201d that some primate individuals might employ to better make their way in society, increase opportunities and share resources.",
      "\u201cWhat we see is that when there are social difficulties in a species, then same-sex is a currency to help,\u201d Savolainen said.",
      "He added that the behavior is likely common in more than 23 primate species, but the data on the subject is limited and some species haven\u2019t been studied closely.",
      "It can be difficult for scientists to observe and interpret same-sex sexual behaviors in field research. Plus, many researchers once viewed these behaviors as unusual and outside of their focus, so they might not have documented instances of it carefully. Additionally, Savolainen said, it\u2019s difficult to secure funding to study same-sex sexual behavior in animals, particularly from government agencies, so that might have kept researchers from pursuing the topic, as well.",
      "\u201cWe have lots of species where we don\u2019t know whether it exists. It\u2019s not documented,\u201d Savolainen said. \u201cScientists have overlooked this, and you can\u2019t understand how a society works well if you don\u2019t integrate this as part of multiple behaviors you need to take into account. Hopefully, we\u2019ll have a lot more data in the future.\u201d",
      "The new study does not attempt to relate the findings to modern human sexual behavior, but it does say that human ancestors were subject to the same environmental and social pressures that the researchers think drive same-sex behavior in other primates.",
      "Previous research has shown that same-sex behavior in macaques is widespread, could be inherited and that certain behaviors could be traced to specific genetic bloodlines. Female bonobos are frequently observed rubbing genitals amid social tension. Same-sex behaviors have also been observed in chimpanzees.",
      "Marlene Zuk, a University of Minnesota professor and evolutionary biologist who researches same-sex behavior in animals but did not work on the new study, said the new analysis was exciting because it covered such a broad range of primates.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s really impressive is the breadth of data that they\u2019ve pulled together here,\u201d she said.",
      "Zuk was not surprised by the authors\u2019 conclusion that environmental and social influences appeared to play a role in primates\u2019 same-sex behavior. The new study, she said, highlights a common misunderstanding about animal sexual behavior. It\u2019s more nuanced than people assume, and not always about making babies.",
      "\u201cSexual behavior is often about more than reproduction, and that\u2019s certainly true in our species. But, people don\u2019t tend to think that it\u2019s also true in other species,\u201d Zuk said. \u201cThey have this idea that in all animals, except for people, that they\u2019re old-fashioned Roman Catholics and they can only have sex briefly when it\u2019s going to result in an offspring and with the lights off, you know? And that\u2019s just not how animals are either.\u201d",
      "She added that scientists long ago ruled out the idea that animals or humans might possess a particular \u201cgay gene\u201d responsible for driving same-sex behavior.",
      "\u201cThere is not a single identifiable gene in people or any other animal that will irrevocably and in all cases mean that the animal exhibits solely same-sex behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat is really clear to most of us who work in the field, but somehow seems to escape a lot of everybody else, is that pretty much all behaviors, and indeed pretty much all traits in general, whether they\u2019re physical or psychological or whatever, are going to be the result of influence from genes and the environment.\u201d"

      "Williams was 9 years old the last time the Bears won a playoff game, during the 2010 season, until Saturday, when Chicago scored 25 points in the fourth quarter to overcome an 18-point deficit and beat division rival Green Bay Packers. Of the Bears\u2019 10 longest plays from scrimmage, nine came in the second half and six in the fourth quarter.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re here and I\u2019m going to be here for a while, is my plan,\u201d Williams said. \u201cBe in a bunch of games, be in these moments and come out victorious. That\u2019s the mindset for right now this year. That\u2019s also the mindset for the future.\u201d",
      "One night later, Maye produced a performance against the Los Angeles Chargers that the second-year quarterback said \"wasn't his best.\" Still, his touchdown pass late in the fourth quarter of his first career postseason game sealed New England\u2019s first playoff victory since the 2018 season.",
      "Though both Williams and Maye were better than their older counterparts, Green Bay's Jordan Love and the Chargers' Justin Herbert, youth didn't win out entirely over wisdom during the weekend.",
      "With eight consecutive wins to close the season, 26-year-old Trevor Lawrence and Jacksonville had become a dark horse title contenders. Their playoffs ended after just one game, however, after eight-year veteran Josh Allen scored three touchdowns to lead a Buffalo comeback and earn the Bills' first playoff win on the road in 33 years.",
      "\"He definitely carried them,\" Jacksonville Jaguars coach Liam Coen said of Allen.",
      "Stafford completed six of his seven passes on the Rams' game-winning drive in the final minute to beat Carolina and third-year quarterback Bryce Young on the road Saturday. It keeps alive the Rams' hopes of winning their second Super Bowl in five seasons.",
      "\u201cYou see him out there, he just has the best composure of anyone I have ever seen,\" Rams tight end Colby Parkinson said. \"He knows that we are going to go make it happen and we completely trust him.\"",
      "Although Stafford has been an NFL mainstay for 17 seasons, Saturday marked only his 11th career postseason game. Rams star receiver Puka Nacua said of the comeback, there was \"never a doubt \u2014 No. 9 (Stafford) is with us.\"",
      "On the other end of the spectrum, although San Francisco's Brock Purdy is only in his fourth season, the 49ers' win Sunday that knocked out defending champion Philadelphia Eagles was already Purdy's seventh career postseason start.",
      "Two of the most fascinating storylines left in the season center on whether the teams that were the AFC and NFC's best during the regular season can remain so in the playoffs largely because their quarterbacks have either unimpressive or untested playoff credentials.",
      "In the NFC, top-seeded Seattle Seahawks will host the 49ers in next week's division round. Quarterback Sam Darnold, who fell apart with the Minnesota Vikings in last year's postseason, leading him to change teams and sign with Seattle in the offseason, has the chance to prove that his second consecutive superlative regular season was not a fluke.",
      "But San Francisco will not make it easy. Though Darnold threw 25 touchdowns this season, he didn't throw any in two games against the 49ers.",
      "And in the AFC, the Denver Broncos are the top seed for the first time since 2015. That season, they won the Super Bowl with future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning playing the last of his 17 seasons. A decade later, Bo Nix will be making his playoff debut in next week's divisional round, when the Broncos host Buffalo.",
      "Of all the quarterbacks left, Rodgers has by far the most experience. But Pittsburgh, which claimed the last postseason berth on the final play of the regular season, isn't viewed as a favorite to advance to the Super Bowl \u2014 which leaves a path for Allen to become the new face of a changing NFL postseason landscape.",
      "Allen is 8-6 in the playoffs in his career. Four of those losses came against Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs, who ended Buffalo's season each of the last two years.",
      "With their nemesis, Kansas City, no longer a postseason obstacle, and a majority of the remaining quarterbacks possessing less experience than Allen, the Bills will try to mend the franchise's playoff heartbreak that dates to losing four consecutive Super Bowls between 1990-93.",
      "\"When your quarterback\u2019s that type of warrior, that type of competitor, it just goes through the whole team,\" Bills coach Sean McDermott said Sunday.",
      "Whether Allen can finally go through the whole postseason and emerge a champion is now the question."

      "Rob Rausch was once just a guy looking for his perfect match on \u201cLove Island USA.\u201d Now, the 27-year-old reality TV star has traded the romantic villa out in Fiji for the cutthroat Scottish digs of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d\u2014 and he\u2019s playing the game as one of the villains.",
      "Peacock\u2019s addictive psychological game show is back for Season 4, during which contestants live together in a castle in Scotland while secretly plotting each other\u2019s demise. (Peacock and TODAY share a parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "The premise is devilishly simple: A group of players must work together to complete challenges and build a prize fund, but hidden among them are \u201ctraitors\u201d whose job is to secretly eliminate their fellow contestants one by one. Meanwhile, the \u201cfaithful\u201d must figure out who the traitors are and vote them off before they\u2019re picked off themselves.",
      "Rob Rausch is a Traitor on Season 4",
      "At the ever so dramatic opening roundtable ceremony, host Alan Cumming tapped Rausch to be one of the season's secret traitors and the reality star couldn't have been more thrilled with the assignment.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy as can be. I honestly think I\u2019ll make a really good traitor,\u201d Rausch said after being chosen. \u201cI\u2019m hard to read, I\u2019ve been told that by every girl I\u2019ve ever dated, and I\u2019m extremely competitive. I like to win.\u201d",
      "The country boy sees his underestimated personality as a major advantage in the game. \"I've been underestimated my entire life. I\u2019m just a guy from Alabama. I catch snakes, post videos on the internet. I\u2019m kinda quiet, but I think that\u2019s one of my biggest strengths,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen people underestimate you that\u2019s when you catch them by surprise.\u201d",
      "Who is Rob Rausch?",
      "Rob Rausch, now 27, is a snake wrangler from Florence, Alabama, according to his \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 5 bio, and he grew up on a farm with three siblings.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d viewers know just how much Rausch loves wildlife. His expertise with snakes and other creatures became his calling card when he began posting snake-wrangling content in 2021 and amassed a devoted following. A quick scroll of his socials will show that he\u2019s still passionate.",
      "His Southern charm, good looks and fearless handling of dangerous reptiles kept an interest even post-\u201cLove Island USA\u201d; when he left the show, the wildlife enthusiast became a bonafide social media influencer. To date, Rausch has 2.2 million followers on TikTok and 1.4 million on Instagram.",
      "What Is Rob Rausch Known For?",
      "While his snake-wrangling videos made him an internet sensation, it was reality TV that truly put Rausch on the map.",
      "He made his \u201cLove Island USA\u201d debut in Season 5 during the Casa Amor episodes \u2014 if you know, you know \u2014 but was dumped from the island just a few days later.",
      "The villa didn\u2019t bring Rausch love that first summer, but viewers were elated to see him return as an original cast member for \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6 the following year.",
      "This time, he lasted significantly longer in the show, coupling up with cast members like Leah Kateb, Andrea Carmona and Kassy Castillo as he searched for a meaningful connection.",
      "He was ultimately eliminated toward the end of Season 6. His fellow cast members later reunited for spinoff called \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa\u201d that followed their lives together in Los Angeles in 2025. Rausch, however, did not appear."

      "Emily Bader and Tom Blyth co-star in the first installment in author Emily Henry's cinematic universe, which hit Netflix Jan. 9. An homage to \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" the story follows best friends Poppy and Alex from when they meet at college through years of annual summer trips.",
      "The film is a romantic romp, with settings like Barcelona, Tuscany, New Orleans and the woods of Canada, set to a soundtrack consisting of Robyn, Taylor Swift and Paula Abdul. And it hits all the romantic comedy beats: a hilarious miscommunication between Alex and Poppy's dad (played by Alan Ruck), a steamy kiss on a balcony in the pouring rain (the actors say it was actually freezing) and a sprint to profess one's love (through an Ohio neighborhood, rather than an airport).",
      "The book was first published in May 2021, marking the second in Henry's meteoric run of romantic comedies. She published six books in five years \u2014 \"Beach Read\" (2020), \"People We Meet on Vacation\" (2021), \"Book Lovers\" (2022), \"Happy Place\" (2023), \"Funny Story\" (2024), \"A Great Big Beautiful Life\" (2025) \u2014 almost all of which are currently optioned for screen adaptations. (On Jan. 8, Deadline reported that \"Funny Story\" is headed to development at Netflix, while Henry herself is set to write the screenplays for both \"Funny Story\" and \"Happy Place.\")",

      "\"Emily Henry's not only a genius, but a very wonderful human being,\" Bader continues.",
      "\"A very thoughtful, emotionally available human being,\" Blyth adds.",
      "Below, the co-stars unpack answer all on our burning questions, starting with the often mused fan question, why is it called \"People We Meet on Vacation\"? (Of note, the U.K. version of the book is titled, \"You and Me on Vacation.\")",
      "Their answer? Surprisingly deep.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "Tom Blyth: Why is it called \"People We Meet on Vacation\" when it's mostly about the two of us \u2014",
      "Emily Bader: About two people who don't meet on vacation?",
      "TB: I think that's kind of the point. I think it's about these two people meeting new versions of each other again and again and again over time, and falling in love with each other again and again, and more and more. So it's like (gesturing between them) these are the people we meet on vacation.",
      "EB: We meet different versions of ourselves. That's it. Canon now.",
      "EB: It's funny because Poppy almost sort of is taking the role of the man character that you often see in the rom-coms. Like if we're talking \"When Harry Met Sally...,\" (she's) more Billy Crystal. And I think that's really fun. She's very carefree and takes up all the space that she wants to, which I think is an exciting new interpretation.",
      "TB: I think for Alex, his unique spin is the \"Vacation Alex\" aspect, which is him slowly coming out of his shell because of this person who gives him the power to express himself \u2014\u00a0epitomized by him stripping off and running into the sea.",
      "EB: Getting naked. (Laughs.)",
      "EB: There's a lot of them. It's very logistical.",
      "TB: Very technical.",
      "EB: A lot of gallon tanks filled with just ice cold, chilly water that they that they just pelt you with.",
      "TB: We'd love to tell you it was super romantic to film the rain scene, but it's very cold and loud because the machines were on non-stop.",
      "EB: And I think it was like 4 in the morning. So we were very delusional. There was a lot of giggling.",
      "TB: And there was a storm in Barcelona anyway so it was already \u2014",
      "EB: It was already raining, but we couldn't \u2014",
      "TB: Couldn't use it because you can't see it on camera. But yeah, we just, we hung in there, relied on each other, and I think we pulled it off.",
      "EB: We'll see.",
      "EB: I think it's so amazing that we got to be a part of the first one. I do think that it's going to be a very long journey for her. Advice? Have fun. They're amazing people. Emily Henry's not only a genius, but a very wonderful human.",
      "TB: Very thoughtful, emotionally available human being.",
      "EB: Emotionally intelligent. And so are the fans of her books.",
      "TB: Lean in. Have fun. You can have that too much fun, that's what I learned. I went into this trying to play Alex \u2014\u00a0he's quite serious at times. But it's so much fun when he gets to release. And so, yeah, as much release as possible.",
      "EB: I think for Poppy, her music taste is also sort of seen in the way that she dresses. She's someone who reacts really strongly to something that she loves, and once she loves it, it's hers forever, even if it makes absolutely no sense in her closet or her catalog of music. And I love that about her. She just, she likes what she likes, and it's all over the map.",
      "TB: The soundtrack's amazing. (Director) Brett Haley is a musical genius. He picks songs like nobody else. I think it's going to go down in history as a great movie soundtrack.",
      "For Alex, I think the musical side of him that we didn't see, I've seen him described as a black cat boyfriend. Instead of like a golden retriever, he's more of a black cat. And so I think it's like The Smiths. \"500 Days of Summer\" kind of vibes.",
      "EB: Oh, he is such a \"500 Days of Summer\" guy. And absolutely no jazz, apparently.",
      "TB: But he's got moves."

      "The Emmy-winning Peacock competition series is back with the same murderous game mechanics and a new twist that will keep even the viewers second guessing who they can trust. The first four episodes of Season 4 arrived on Peacock Thursday, Jan. 8 with a supersized premiere that quickly introduced fans to the 23 cast members \u2014 featuring multiple \u201cReal Housewives\u201d alums, Olympians, Survivor winners and more celebrities \u2014 who learned if they have to play the game as a Faithful or a Traitor.",
      "But before they stepped foot into the castle, Cumming announced a new element: he would select a \u201cSecret Traitor\u201d in plain sight in front of everyone. That player\u2019s identity would remain hidden from everyone, including the audience, until later on in the game. He later selected his group of Traitors, and the Faithfuls set off to unmask them.",

      "Episode 1",
      "The premiere begins with all of the players arriving at the darkened castle. After briefly meeting each other and seeing some familiar faces, they are informed about Cumming\u2019s \u201cSecret Traitor\u201d twist. Each player has a box with their name on it. One by one, they approach Cumming and he shows if their box contains a grim reaper card, confirming them as the Secret Traitor. Their identity is withheld from the audience. Everyone then moves into the castle and gathers around the Round Table for Cumming to choose the other Traitors.",
      "After covertly circling the room multiple times, he selects three Traitors to join his turret: \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d alum Lisa Rinna, former \u201cThe Real Housewives of Potomac\u201d star Candiace Dillard Bassett and Rob Rausch from \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 6. Later in the turret that night, the three learn about the Secret Traitor (who wears a special red cloak) and their power. Every week, the Secret Traitor creates a shortlist of players to be murdered until all the Traitors have the chance to team up.",
      "The first mission requires the cast to divide into groups of three and find coffins marked with dollar signs in a loch. The coffins are then placed in one of the player\u2019s graves, meaning they are at risk for murder. At the end, nine players are on the chopping block.",
      "Back at the mansion, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Atlanta\u201d star Porsha Williams confronts actor Michael Rapaport after hearing from Dillard Bassett that he wanted to target all the housewives. But Dillard Bassett says that Williams misheard her, leading to more confusion. Cumming announces at the end of the episode to the audience that the Secret Traitor chose four out of the nine at risk players to be on the shortlist for murder. The three Traitors receive a letter from the Secret Traitor with the four names: Rausch, Ian Terry from \u201cBig Brother,\u201d Mark Ballas from \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d and singer-songwriter Eric Nam.",
      "Episode 2",
      "The episode opens with \u201cThe Traitors\u201d tradition of having each player arrive for breakfast except one. Viewers discover that the Traitors chose to murder Ian Terry. In his final confessional, a disappointed Terry says, \u201cI had a feeling that was going to be the case. I just don\u2019t know what I could\u2019ve done differently. But, you know what, this is the biggest backhanded compliment in this game.\u201d",
      "Before the players depart for the second mission, Williams slips up again by accidentally saying that she \u201ckilled\u201d Terry, causing comedian Ron Funches\u2019 ears to perk up. At the mission, more drama unfolds, this time between \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Yamil \u201cYam Yam\u201d Arocho and \u201cLove Island\u201d UK star Maura Higgins. The players have to transport three players on a throne back to the castle. Along the way, they have to make multiple stops and collect gold or shields. The last players on the throne when they reach the castle will be safe from murder. Arocho takes Higgins' spot on the throne, securing his safety for the night, and Rapaport inserts himself in the conversation by claiming that he also needed a shield. He continues to call out Arocho in front of everyone when they return to the mansion. Meanwhile, Williams errs again by mentioning that there are four Traitors, adding to the list of evidence Funches is compiling.",
      "At the first Round Table, \u201cSurvivor\u201d winner Natalie Anderson kicks things off by explaining why she thinks Donna \u201cMama\u201d Kelce is a Traitor. But Funches\u2019 theory about Williams is more compelling. It is a close vote, but Williams receives one more vote than Kelce and is banished. While standing on the Circle of Truth, Williams says, \u201cI came in and I tried to fight for the housewives and it almost started to feel like I\u2019m going to be the one who is going to help to lead us to find a Traitor the first time. I am a Faithful.\u201d The group is stunned and Funches says in his confessional that he feels like he put a target on his back.",
      "Toward the end of Episode 2, the Traitors are tasked with completing a covert murder in plain sight. The Traitors must find a set of tarot cards hidden in the kitchen that reveal the second shortlist from the Secret Traitor. Next, they have to take the card of the person they want to murder and burn it in the fireplace in the breakfast room. If successful, they can meet the Secret Traitor and unite. If unsuccessful, there will not be a murder that night and they will not have any control over the next murder.",
      "Rausch spots the red reaper painting in the kitchen and instantly knows that is where the tarot cards are hidden. Meanwhile, Dillard Bassett starts a Conga line to distract the rest of the players. But \u201cSurvivor\u201d star Rob Cesternino isn\u2019t fooled. He tells \u201cBig Brother\u201d alum Tiffany Mitchell that he suspects a murder is happening in plain sight and she needs to stay alert. He also shares this theory with Dillard Bassett and Ballas.",
      "Rausch takes the tarot cards to Rinna and they discuss the shortlist: \u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d star Mon\u00e9t X Change, Olympic figure skater Tara Lipinski, \u201cTop Chef\u201d host Kristen Kish and Cesternino. The two Traitors slip away to the breakfast room, without having time to consult with Dillard Bassett, and burn one card, murdering a player.",
      "Episode 3",
      "All the players safely arrive to breakfast the next morning except one: Cesternino. We see a flashback where he learned his fate. \u201cI don\u2019t know how they got me. I leave with no regrets. Traitors, I\u2019ll get you next time,\u201d he says.",
      "Rapaport abruptly starts targeting Arocho again about the shield from the last mission, rubbing multiple players the wrong way. Cumming arrives and shocks the players by sharing that there will be a morning Round Table meeting and banishment. Many of the players meet and agree that they will vote for Kelce to be banished. Kelce attempts to defend herself and suggests that Rapaport is a Traitor.",
      "But the players stand firm on their decision to banish her. They all vote to remove her from the game except Rapaport, who voted for Arocho, and Kelce, who voted for Rapaport.",
      "While standing on the Circle of Truth, Kelce says, \u201cI know I\u2019m the sacrificial lamb and I know that I had a blast meeting every single one of you. On that note, I think I\u2019m going to go \u2026 but you got yourself a Traitor!\u201d",
      "Kelce is then revealed as the Secret Traitor who was chosen by Cumming when they first arrived. The episode \u201crewinds\u201d to show the moments she met in secret with Cumming and planned her shortlists. Kelce says in her confessional that her strategy was to be a lovable mom figure during the day and a \u201cdevious Traitor at night.\u201d She says that she targeted players with her shortlists who were laying low and not speaking up.",
      "Reflecting on her game, she says, \u201cPlaying a Traitor was tough but I gave it my best shot. This has been a dream come true.\u201d Getting emotional, she adds, \u201cThese are happy tears that I get to do this at this point in my life. It\u2019s just the joy of being in the game.\u201d",
      "Cumming asks each player to pair up with the person they trust most. Funches is the odd person out, so he will be automatically shortlisted for murder. The duos select one person to be put in a cage and another to hunt for skulls and stack them in a tower. Kish, \u201cThe Real Housewives of Dubai\u201d star Caroline Stanbury, Rinna and Nam\u2019s partners are all unsuccessful which means they are at risk.",
      "The at-risk players are left behind and tied to trees where they wait to find out if they will be murdered by the Traitors face to face. After making their decision in the turret, the Traitors go to the woods and meet with each player. Nam pleads for his life in the game. Kish says she won\u2019t beg. Stanbury says she isn\u2019t ready to go and Funches threatens the Traitors.",
      "He says if they don\u2019t kill him now they will regret it later. \u201cShow me your faces!\u201d he shouts as the episode ends.",
      "Episodes 4 and 5 of \u201cThe Traitors\u201d Season 4 will stream on Peacock Thursday, Jan. 15 at 6 p.m. PT/ 9 p.m. ET."

      "A Concert for Altadena, held on Jan. 7 at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, was an emotional and uplifting night presented by the band Dawes.",
      "On Jan. 7, 2025, a fire blazed through the Eaton canyon, making its way towards the mountain town of Altadena. On the far west side of Los Angeles, the Palisades fire was also blazing and wreaking havoc. A total of 31 people died and the fires destroyed about 13,000 homes and residential properties, leaving thousands displaced.",
      "To pay tribute to the lives, homes and businesses lost, the one-night benefit concert brought the Altadena community together in hopes of raising money for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation. The organization helps provide resources and options for people who want to stay and rebuild in Altadena.",
      "\u201cWe were all affected in different ways. Every person in Altadena was affected at once, but everyone\u2019s stories are unique and different,\u201d co-producer and co-organizer Kevin Lyman, the creator of Warped Tour and longtime Altadena resident, tells TODAY.com. \u201c(We are) united under one tragedy.\u201d",
      "Approached by Dawes and guitarist Eric Krasno, Lyman teamed up with the two and began producing a show to support the community, raise funds and provide 250 tickets to Altadena residents directly impacted by the fire.",
      "The support was immediate. Everyone who helped with the production, Lyman says, were friends who became \u201cextended family.\u201d The participants also had ties to Altadena, Palisades or Los Angeles and were impacted by the fires.",
      "\u201cI think in Altadena now, we\u2019re all an extended family,\u201d Lyman says, before noting the similarities between rebuilding the town and producing a show for the community. \u201cIt\u2019s such a huge undertaking that if you look at it as a whole, it\u2019s overwhelming... And all we want to do is bring people together.\u201d",
      "Hosted by actor and Altadena resident John C. Reilly, taking the stage during the over three-hour event was Taboo from Black Eyed Peas, who performed \u201cStand Strong,\u201d his song with his daughter Jett Gomez. Jenny Lewis, Ozomatli, Everclear, Aloe Blacc, Rufus Wainwright, Lord Huron, Judith Hill and Lucius were also part of the line up.",
      "Mandy Moore performed her early hit single \u201cCandy\u201d alongside husband Taylor Goldsmith, singer and guitarist of Dawes. The \u201cThis Is Us\u201d star and her family\u2019s home was impacted by the fire, with her in-laws and family losing their houses.",
      "Earlier in the day, Moore had expressed how grateful she was to give back to her town after so much \u201ctrauma and grief.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy heart is with everyone affected: the lives that were lost and the lives that were forever changed on both sides of our beautiful city,\u201d she wrote on Instagram, in part. \u201cI\u2019m grateful for the chance to gather tonight and celebrate how resilient Altadena is; to be in community with one another and MUSIC to commemorate what we\u2019ve lived through and what comes next. I am endlessly grateful to those near and far who supported Los Angeles in our time of need. The work has only just begun but we\u2019re in it together. Altadena forever.\u201d",
      "Brad Paisley played guitar with several artists and performed his song with Dawes, \u201cRaining Inside.\u201d Brandon Flowers from The Killers also helped close out the show before Dawes concluded the event with all their friends.",
      "Speakers from Habitat For Humanity, as well as Altadena Girls, also participated in the event, expressing uplifting words and preaching \u201cAltadena Strong.\u201d Students from Pasadena Waldorf School, which is permanently closed after being damaged by the fire, attended, too.",
      "With rebuilding efforts slowly happening, and only about 10 homes rebuilt so far, according to The Associated Press, the event was able to raise more than $450,000 for the Altadena Builds Back Foundation. There is still an online auction happening through Feb. 21.",
      "\u201cI walk out of my house and I start hearing hammers and I hear saws and I hear trucks coming... (It\u2019s) the sound of rebuilding. That\u2019s how you build a song, one note at a time,\u201d Lyman tells TODAY.com. \u201cThen it becomes, hopefully, something people love \u2014 and that\u2019s what Altadena will become again. It\u2019s going to change... It never will be (the same), but that\u2019s OK.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "After \"High School Musical\" star Ashley Tisdale penned a scathing first-person essay for The Cut about her \"toxic\" mom group, celebrities have been responding. And they are not, in fact, all in this together.",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote how she was initially energized by joining a mom group of friends who happened to be having babies at the same time. Eventually, however, she began to feel left out.",
      "Though Tisdale didn\u2019t name names \u2014 and in fact her rep denied that certain celebrities were part of the clique \u2014 there has been a huge amount of internet speculation about the identity of the other moms in the group.",
      "Meghan Trainor, who has been pegged by internet sleuths as a potential member of Tisdale's former mom crew, shared what seemed like a response to the drama on TikTok on Jan. 8.",
      "The video features an expressionless Trainor typing on a keyboard. The text reads, \"Me finding out about the apparent mom group drama.\" Playing in the background is Trainor's song, \"Still Don't Care,\" highlighting these lyrics: \"Let me take a moment, think it over. Does it touch me at all? Nope, I still don\u2019t care.\"",
      "In her essay, Tisdale wrote, \u201cTo be clear, I have never considered the moms to be bad people. (Maybe one.) But I do think our group dynamic stopped being healthy and positive \u2014 for me, anyway.\u201d",
      "She texted the group that she was leaving because it was getting \u201ctoo high school\u201d for her.",
      "Tisdale, 40, who goes by her married name of Ashley French on her blog, is a mother of two who rose to fame as a child actor in the 2000s on the Disney Channel. Never one to hold back, Tisdale has been outspoken about her personal struggles with mental health, alopecia and breastfeeding.",
      "Responses have been rolling in from other celebrities.",
      "On Jan. 6, Matthew Koma, Hilary Duff's husband, posted a fictional image on his Instagram stories.",
      "The photo looks almost exactly like Tisdale's photo from The Cut: Koma is wearing an almost identical outfit, sitting on a similar-looking off-white couch and striking the same unique pose. The Cut's logo appears in the corner, and the text reads, \"A Mom Group Tell All Through a Father's Eyes: When You're the Most Self Obsessed Tone Deaf Person On Earth, Other Moms Tend To Shift Focus To Their Actual Toddlers.\"",
      "He also included the text: \u201cRead my new interview with @thecut.\u201d",
      "Another Disney Channel star, Christy Carlson Romano, also shared her feelings about mom groups on Instagram on Jan. 6.",
      "Moms of older kids sometimes end up \"cycling out of those friendships, and that kind of sucks,\" Romano said. When the dynamic shifts, moms often find a new group of friends.",
      "\"It's not supposed to be dramatic, but I get it. Sometimes it gets a little crazy and then you write an article about it,\" Romano concludes with a pointed glance at the camera.",
      "Tisdale's husband, Christopher French, shared a cryptic  Instagram message in his stories: \"Underrated life skill: Pausing to decide if it's worth your energy.\" The image was originally posted by @heycoryallen.",
      "Will this mom group rift have an ending worthy of a Disney Channel original movie? Or will the division continue to play out on social media?",
      "As one commenter on Romano's reel wrote, \"These Disney Channel mom group wars were not on my bingo card for 2026.\""

    "story": [
      "Netflix\u2019s \"His & Hers\" opens like a familiar psychological whodunit but ends somewhere far more unsettling.",
      "The six-episode limited series, adapted from Alice Feeney\u2019s novel and created by William Oldroyd, stars Tessa Thompson as Anna Andrews, a once-prominent news reporter, opposite Jon Bernthal as Jack Harper, a small-town detective.",
      "Once married and now estranged, the two are pulled back into each other\u2019s lives when a woman is found murdered in the woods near their sleepy hometown of Dahlonega, Georgia.",
      "The victim is Rachel Hopkins (Jamie Tisdale), a former high-school friend of Anna\u2019s. Her death immediately raises questions, especially when it\u2019s revealed that Jack had been having an affair with Rachel the night before she was killed. As Anna pushes to cover the case as a field reporter and Jack leads the investigation, both find themselves under suspicion, locked in a tense game of truth-telling and omission.",
      "Then, more women from Anna\u2019s past turn up dead: Helen Wang (Poppy Liu) and Zoe (Marin Ireland), each murder marked with friendship bracelets from their teenage years.",
      "Te series frames its central question clearly: Who killed Rachel, and which woman finally snapped?",
      "What Happened to Rachel in High School?",
      "By the finale, the show makes clear it was never about who lost control. It was about who remembered the past and decided to act on it.",
      "That past begins on Anna\u2019s 16th birthday.",
      "Anna, Rachel, Zoe, and Helen were once a tight-knit high-school friend group, inseparable on the surface. That night, under the guise of a celebration, Rachel, the group\u2019s ringleader, lured Anna and an awkward outsider named Catherine Kelly (Astrid Rotenberry) into the woods.",
      "What began as teenage cruelty escalated into something far darker. Older men were brought in. Photos were taken. Catherine managed to escape. Anna didn\u2019t. She was sexually assaulted while the girls she trusted stood by and watched.",
      "The trauma was buried for years, and the girls never told anyone.",
      "Catherine, meanwhile, reinvents herself through massive weight loss and plastic surgery.",
      "Years later, she returns to town under a new name, Lexi Jones (Rebecca Rittenhouse), as a polished, ambitious news anchor who takes over Anna\u2019s job during her absence. Her reappearance ties the violence of the past directly to the present-day investigation, making her a natural suspect, even though she isn\u2019t responsible for the murders.",
      "Who Killed Rachel, Zoe and Helen?",
      "It isn\u2019t until decades later, after Anna loses her three-month-old daughter to sudden infant death syndrome, a tragedy that shatters her marriage and sends her into a year-long disappearance, that the truth fully resurfaces.",
      "While going through old tapes and mementos, Anna\u2019s mother, Mrs. Andrews, discovers footage from that night in the woods and realizes what really happened to her daughter.",
      "For a woman already grieving the loss of her granddaughter and watching her daughter fall apart, the discovery becomes a breaking point.",
      "The series ultimately reveals that Mrs. Andrews is the killer. She fakes dementia to move unnoticed and uses spare keys from her years working as a house cleaner to methodically kill Rachel, Helen, and Zoe, the women she believes destroyed Anna\u2019s life. Each murder is marked by a friendship bracelet, transforming symbols of teenage loyalty into reminders of betrayal.",
      "When Anna reads her mother\u2019s confession in the finale, her reaction is what makes the ending so chilling. She cries and then smiles. She doesn\u2019t turn her mother in. She doesn\u2019t confront her. She accepts what was had been done for her.",
      "Anna then makes her own choice. She never tells Jack the full truth about the woods and that she, not Catherine, had been sexually assaulted. She allows the safer version of the story to stand. And she raises Zoe\u2019s daughter, knowing her own mother killed Zoe, reframing the murder as a twisted attempt to give Anna back the family she lost.",
      "By the final moments, Anna has everything she once wanted: her career, a future, a family.",
      "But it\u2019s built on silence.",
      "\"His & Hers\" doesn\u2019t end by solving a crime. It ends by asking a far darker question, one that lingers long after the credits roll: If the truth only causes more pain, is it still worth telling, or is survival its own form of justice?"

      "\u201cThe President and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the U.S. Military is always an option at the Commander in Chief\u2019s disposal,\u201d it said.",
      "The White House statement was issued shortly after major European allies, including Denmark, said in a joint statement that they would \u201cnot stop defending\u201d the values of sovereignty and Greenland\u2019s territorial integrity.",
      "\u201cGreenland belongs to its people,\u201d they said.",
      "A senior White House official told NBC News that other options under consideration include purchasing the territory from Denmark or forming what's known as a compact of free association with the island.",
      "The U.S. government has similar agreements with the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of Palau. Those deals include financial assistance in exchange for allowing the U.S. to have security presences there.",

      "President Donald Trump and his team have expressed their desire to take over the semi-autonomous territory for months, citing its strategic importance and vast mineral wealth. The pronouncements have ramped up in recent days, with Trump telling NBC News on Monday that he was \"very serious\" about acquiring the territory.",
      "U.S. allies in NATO have begun to take the threats more seriously in the wake of last weekend's attack against Venezuela and the ouster of its president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "\u201cThe Kingdom of Denmark \u2014 including Greenland \u2014 is part of NATO,\u201d the leaders of France, Germany, Britain, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark said in their joint statement.",
      "\u201cSecurity in the Arctic must therefore be achieved collectively, in conjunction with NATO allies including the United States, by upholding the principles of the U.N. Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders,\" they added. \u201cIt is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.\u201d",
      "Stephen Miller, Trump\u2019s deputy chief of staff for policy, told CNN on Monday that it's the formal position of the Trump administration that \u201cGreenland should be part of the United States.\u201d",
      "Asked whether military action was off the table, Miller said, \"It wouldn\u2019t be military action against Greenland.\"",
      "\"The real question is, what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? What is the basis of their territorial claim?\" he said.",
      "The U.S. signed an agreement in 1916 saying it \u201cwill not object to the Danish Government extending their political and economic interests to the whole of Greenland\u201d as part of a deal to buy what is now called the U.S. Virgin Islands.",
      "Trump alarmed Danish officials last month when he named Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as his special envoy to Greenland. The Republican governor has publicly supported Trump\u2019s proposal to incorporate Greenland into the U.S. In a post on X thanking Trump, Landry called the appointment a \u201cvolunteer position to make Greenland a part of the U.S.\u201d",

      "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s appropriate,\u201d Johnson said in response to a question Tuesday night from NBC News.",
      "\u201cI think Greenland is viewed by a lot of people as something that would be a strategic position for the U.S.,\u201d Johnson told reporters as he left the Capitol. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it develops from there.\u201d",
      "Asked if Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers in Monday's classified briefing that Trump preferred to buy Greenland, Johnson said, \"I don\u2019t remember that. He might have said it in jest or something. I\u2019m not sure.\"",
      "Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that he does not \"think anybody\u2019s talking about using military force in Greenland.\"",
      "\"They\u2019re looking at diplomatic channels,\" he said.",
      "Asked about the White House's comments on the military, Johnson said, \"The U.S. always has military options for everything.\"",
      "\"I think it\u2019s a general statement,\" he added. \"I think with Greenland, it\u2019s very clear that we are working on their diplomatic channels.\"",
      "On Wednesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot told local radio that he had spoken to Rubio and that his American counterpart had \u201cruled out the possibility of what has just happened in Venezuela happening in Greenland.\u201d",
      "Trump has spoken more about taking over Greenland following the 2024 presidential election. Last January, before taking office, Trump suggested he could use military force to acquire Greenland and the Panama Canal.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told her country\u2019s TV2 on Monday that \u201cif the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops.\u201d",
      "Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart, Vivian Motzfeldt, have requested a meeting with Rubio in the near future, according to a statement posted Tuesday to Greenland\u2019s government website. Previous requests for a sit-down were not successful, the statement said."

      "To hear President Donald Trump tell it, a push to take control of Greenland is a \u201cnational security\u201d necessity, critical to reinforcing control of the Arctic against possible threats from Russia and China.",
      "For America\u2019s allies and Greenlanders themselves, however, Trump\u2019s threats to seize the semi-autonomous Danish territory cut much deeper, and threaten to shatter the decades-old principle of Western defense cooperation.",
      "But there may be little they can do to stop it.",
      "\u201cThis is a threat that is completely appalling, to be honest,\u201d Aaja Chemnitz, one of two Greenlandic lawmakers in the Danish parliament, said in an interview Thursday. \u201cYou can\u2019t just buy another country, a people, the soul of Greenland,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cEverybody in Greenland is discussing it, and many people are worried and concerned.\u201d",
      "That alarm is shared across European capitals.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron accused the United States on Thursday of \u201cbreaking free from the international rules that it used to promote,\u201d while German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier warned the world risked descending into a \u201cden of robbers, where the most unscrupulous take whatever they want.\u201d",
      "Though it looms artificially large on a Mercator projection map, where it is stretched to the scale of Africa despite being 14 times smaller in size, Greenland has rarely figured so prominently in mainstream Western consciousness.",
      "The vast island \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined \u2014 is inhabited by only 57,000 people, about the same as Carson City, Nevada. Around 90% of them are Indigenous Inuit people whose ancestors arrived more than 1,000 years ago.",
      "Denmark colonized Greenland 300 years ago and granted it the status of an autonomous territory in the 1970s, while retaining control of military and foreign policy.",
      "American designs on Greenland go back way further than Trump. In 1867, then-Secretary of State William H. Seward contemplated annexing Greenland, as well as Iceland, having recently bought Alaska from Russia.",
      "The United States briefly took control of Greenland during World War II to stop it from being used by the Nazis, and an agreement has existed since 1951 that allows the U.S. to \u201cconstruct, install, maintain, and operate\u201d military bases across the island.",
      "Greenland\u2019s sole U.S. military base was used as an early detection post for Soviet nuclear missiles during the Cold War, home to thousands of troops at its peak. Locked in by ice for nine months of the year, the Pituffik base is now overseen by the U.S. Space Force and houses a much smaller number of troops.",
      "When Trump first said he wanted to buy Greenland in 2019, in what he described as a \u201creal estate deal,\u201d it was widely seen internationally as absurd.",
      "But after years of pressure from Trump, and the U.S. attack on Venezuela, few in Europe are laughing.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet with the foreign ministers from Denmark and Greenland next week for further discussions, as officials push for a deal.",
      "But the White House says that all options are on the table, including military action. An attack by NATO\u2019s most powerful member on an ally would most likely implode the alliance, which for decades has upheld the principle of collective defense.",
      "\u201cWe are going to do something on Greenland, whether they like it or not, because if we don\u2019t do it, Russia or China will take over Greenland, and we\u2019re not going to have Russia or China as a neighbor,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to allow Russia or China to occupy Greenland, and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if we don\u2019t own it,\u201d he said during the public portion of a meeting with oil and gas executives.",
      "European powers including Britain, France and Germany said in a joint statement this week they \u201cwill not stop defending\u201d the principles of territorial integrity, but most experts agree with White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller\u2019s blunt assessment that \u201cnobody\u2019s going to fight the U.S. over the future of Greenland.\u201d",
      "The European Union could impose sanctions on Washington, or limit its use of military bases in Europe, but both would be mutually painful in the extreme, said Mika Aaltola, a Finnish lawmaker who serves on the European Union\u2019s Foreign Affairs Committee.",
      "\u201cWe are basically in a trap that is difficult to resolve,\u201d Aaltola told NBC News.",
      "\u201cWe thought that January would be about peace deals or a cease-fire in Ukraine,\u201d he said, referring to diplomatic efforts between the U.S. and Europe to end that conflict. \u201cBut all of a sudden, we realized that Trump has manipulated us into a situation where he wants to have Greenland.\u201d",
      "Iain Duncan Smith, a veteran British lawmaker, said \u201cthe reality for Europe is they need to probably offer an alternative to the demand that Trump is making.\u201d",
      "There is bafflement alongside the dismay. Trump already has huge scope to build new military bases on Greenland or negotiate deals for its minerals, but he has refused to compromise on his demand for \u201cownership\u201d to be transferred.",
      "He said Friday: \u201cWhen we own it, we defend it. You don\u2019t defend leases the same way. You have to own it.\u201d",
      "Aside from being a good outpost from which to keep an eye on Russia, Greenland also forms one side of the \u201cGIUK gap\u201d (which stands for Greenland, Iceland, United Kingdom), a naval choke point for submarines and other vessels in and out of the Atlantic.",
      "As the global ice sheet melts, new Arctic sea routes are emerging that Trump\u2019s team and other Western officials fear could be exploited by China and Russia.",
      "Beijing has certainly made moves in the region, declaring itself in 2019 to be a \u201cnear Arctic nation\u201d and outlining plans for a \u201cPolar silk road\u201d to mirror the infrastructure belt it has constructed on land.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to this motive Wednesday, saying U.S. ownership of Greenland was required \u201cto deter Russian and Chinese aggression in the Arctic region,\u201d though she said there would be \u201cmany other benefits.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance cited Greenland\u2019s continued role in missile defense infrastructure in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, criticizing what he said was a lack of investment from Denmark and Europe that left it vulnerable to potential threats from \u201cthe Russians and the Chinese.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey haven\u2019t done a good job of securing that area, that land mass,\u201d he said.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to the U.S., Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, said the country has recently invested $4 billion in Arctic security, including expanding the permanent presence of its armed forces.",
      "The retreating ice floes may also yield new opportunities to exploit its vast mineral reserves, a subject that has proven to be at the forefront of Trump\u2019s mind in negotiations over Ukraine and Venezuela.",
      "In 2023, the European Commission carried out a survey that found 25 of the 34 elements it classified as \u201ccritical raw materials\u201d were found on Greenland. These substances are crucial in producing everything from electric vehicle batteries to cutting-edge military hardware \u2014 vital currency in the global tech battle with China and others.",
      "Trump himself has denied minerals are a factor, positioning Greenland as a \u201cnational security\u201d issue, though some around him are eager to take advantage.",
      "\u201cThis is about critical minerals. This is about natural resources,\u201d then-congressman Mike Waltz, who would later become Trump\u2019s national security adviser, said last January.",
      "The reality is likely a mix of all these factors, according to William Alberque, former director of NATO\u2019s Arms Control, Disarmament and WMD Non-Proliferation Centre.",
      "\u201cGreenland is a toxic combination of issues in terms of this administration\u2019s interests,\u201d Alberque said. \u201cIt brings together the China hawks, the legitimate concerns about Atlantic security, the America Firsters and continental security, and let\u2019s not forget naked economic interests.\u201d"

      "No political prisoners appear to have been released, and the government is cracking down on any new signs of dissent, arresting people they said celebrated Maduro\u2019s capture by the United States military. The country\u2019s security and intelligence apparatus is out in force, with masked paramilitary \u201ccolectivos\u201d \u2014 armed civilians who support the government \u2014 roaming the streets on motorcycles, and military intelligence agents in civilian clothes circulating in vans with an official insignia and setting up roadblocks. The entire top leadership remains intact, with the notable exception of Maduro himself.",
      "The lack of change in government was underlined by a recent classified intelligence assessment that determined that top members of the Maduro regime \u2014 including former Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, sworn in as interim president on Monday \u2014 were best positioned to lead Venezuela\u2019s government and maintain stability.",

      "The internet blackout has made it difficult for international media to gauge the extent of the protests, but footage verified by NBC News showed hundreds of anti-government protesters gathered at Kaj Square in Tehran, clapping and shouting the name of their country.",
      "Another verified video showed hundreds of protesters gathered in Tehran\u2019s Ponak Square, chanting, playing music and waving their phone flashlights in the air. Other footage showed scores had also gathered in the city\u2019s Heravi Square, singing and clapping their hands as they marched through the streets.",
      "It is unclear if the videos were taken on Friday or Saturday night. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard-aligned media claimed that Saturday was a \u201ccalm\u201d night across the country, with security forces having \u201cput the rioters back in their place.\u201d",
      "Solidarity protests took place in France, Germany and the United Kingdom as many Iranians living in Europe offered their support to their compatriots inside Iran. Michael Mohkam, a 78-year-old Iranian living in France, said he hoped for change so that expatriates could one day return home.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been living here for 48 years. But my soul and body are in my home country,\u201d Mohkam said. \u201cWhen I left Iran to come here to pursue my studies, I left a magnificent paradise.\u201d",
      "Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran\u2019s late shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, continued to encourage the protesters on Sunday after earlier calling for them to prepare to seize city centers across Iran.",
      "Pahlavi, who lives in the U.S. and has emerged as a figurehead for some of the protesters, touted Trump\u2019s support in a post on X Sunday and promised to be with the protesters \u201csoon.\u201d"

      "On the ground, however, few things are certain, including basic questions around daily security, whether Venezuela\u2019s autocratic government will stay in place, the fate of political prisoners, who will ultimately revitalize its vast and decrepit oil industry, and whether the once rich country will ever prosper again.",
      "On Friday afternoon at an eastern Caracas social club \u2014 one of many private organizations resembling small country clubs \u2014 three mothers watched their children play and discussed whether they should send them to school on Monday when they are due to reopen after the Christmas break.",

      "This is especially true in the working-class areas.",
      "\u201cHere we see a bit of everything,\u201d said a 30-year-old motorcycle taxi driver who lives in the working-class Petare neighborhood. \u201cThere are military, police and colectivos.\u201d",

All this in a country that sits on the world\u2019s largest known oil reserves.",
      "While he cited a desire to stamp out groups that control Venezuela\u2019s illicit drug trade, which have seeped into the government, Trump has also repeatedly made clear his interest in the country\u2019s oil. On Wednesday he told The New York Times that the U.S. could stay in charge \u201cfor years\u201d to lead the revival of the vast energy sector.",
      "\u201cAmerican companies will have the opportunity to rebuild Venezuela\u2019s rotting energy infrastructure and eventually increase oil production to levels never, ever seen before,\u201d he said Friday at the opening of a meeting with the heads of some of the world\u2019s largest oil companies. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be making the decision as to which oil companies are going to go in.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had our assets seized there twice, and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re confident that with this administration and President Trump, working hand in hand with the Venezuelan government, that those changes can be put in place.\u201d",
      "Trump has said that he is in control in Venezuela, and his government is working well with interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who was Maduro\u2019s vice president.",

A candidate who stood in her stead is widely considered to have won the vote, but Maduro claimed victory.",

During the day, businesses such as supermarkets, pharmacies, bakeries and caf\u00e9s are open, at night many bars and restaurants still keep their doors closed.

      "Huge crowds took to the streets of the capital Tehran and other cities late Thursday into Friday, according to videos posted online, in one of the largest shows of force against the country\u2019s religious establishment in several years. Dozens have already been killed in a violent crackdown by security forces.",
      "The protests started in the heart of the capital over the collapse of Iran's currency and soaring prices. They have since broadened with demonstrators chanting slogans against Khamenei, the highest authority in the country, in Tehran and other cities.",
      "Some have shouted their support for the late former shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, something that could bring a death sentence in the past. Reza Pahlavi, the shah's exiled son, has urged his supporters to take to the streets.",
      "Pahlavi issued calls, rebroadcast by Farsi-language satellite news channels and websites abroad, for Iranians to return to the streets Friday night.",
      "In a separate post on social media, he called for Trump\u2019s help. \u201cYou have proven and I know you are a man of peace and a man of your word. Please be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said Friday in a statement reported by Iran's hard-line Student News Network  that \"protecting the achievements of the Islamic Revolution\" is a \"red line,\" while acknowledging \"the livelihood and professional concerns of the people\" and \"any potential negligence.\"",
      "NetBlocks, an internet monitoring group, said on X that the internet had been completely cut off across the country by early evening Thursday local time, a tactic that officials have used during past protests to prevent unrest from spreading and videos of violence leaking out of the country, analysts say.",
      "Iran \u201cis now in the midst of a nationwide internet blackout,\u201d the group said.",
      "Khamenei's official X account continued to post messages on Friday in English and Farsi, even as the rest of Iran was cut off.",
      "Authorities have struggled to contain the protests after 12 days, and top officials have given conflicting messages about how to deal with the unrest.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has said protesters\u2019 concerns should be addressed, while hard-liners have issued stern warnings and claimed foreign agents were stoking the unrest.",
      "Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran, a New York-based advocacy group, said in a telephone interview: \u201cWe know the president doesn\u2019t really control the situation at times like this.\"",
      "\u201cThe security and intelligence forces are going to do what they always do, and they are starting to do it more systematically,\u201d Ghaemi said.",
      "Security forces have not held back, according to rights groups. Amnesty International said in a news release Thursday that the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and the police \u201chave unlawfully used rifles, shotguns loaded with metal pellets, water cannon, tear gas and beatings to disperse, intimidate and punish largely peaceful protesters.\u201d",
      "Officials have also tried to cover up the killings, Amnesty said, by forcing the families of some victims to give interviews to state media blaming accidents or other protesters. Authorities have threatened secret burials if family members do not comply, the group said.",
      "The group added that there have been \u201cmass arbitrary arrests.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog group that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported Thursday that security forces have killed 42 people during the protests, including six children.",
      "The violent crackdown may come at a price.",
      "Trump, who said he would intervene in Iran last week, repeated the threat Thursday in an interview on \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have let them know that if they start killing people, which they tend to do during their riots \u2014 they have lots of riots \u2014 if they do it, we\u2019re going to hit them very hard,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He also added a message for the protesters. \u201cYou should feel strongly about freedom. There\u2019s nothing like freedom. You\u2019re brave people. It\u2019s a shame what\u2019s happened to your country. Your country was a great country,\u201d Trump said.",
      "A White House official told NBC News that \u201cThe president has demonstrated this with Operation Midnight Hammer and Operation Absolute Resolve that he means what he says,\u201d referring to U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites and Venezuela.",
      "Trump\u2019s warning presents an additional challenge for Iranian authorities who have not been able to contain the unrest in the streets and were alarmed by the surprise capture last weekend of Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a close ally.",
      "\u201cTrump\u2019s threat put the system in a catch-22: If the protests grow, it might resort to increasing levels of violence to subdue them. But if they resort to greater violence, they run the risk of U.S. involvement,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, said in a text message response to questions.",
      "Videos that circulated online Thursday showed large gatherings of protesters in the major cities of Tehran, Mashhad \u2014 long considered a conservative bastion of government support \u2014 and Isfahan, as well as smaller ones such as Kermanshah in western Iran, where demonstrators chanted \u201cDeath to dictator.\u201d",

But we\u2019re not there yet.\u201d"

      "It's the fifth tanker seized by the U.S. in recent weeks, and comes days after American forces in the North Atlantic took control of the Bella 1, a Russian-flagged tanker that fled the American blockade and led a weekslong chase.",

      "\u201cThey decided not to mess around with us,\u201d Trump added.",
      "He evaded a question about whether Putin had called him following the seizure. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that,\u201d Trump said.",
      "The U.S. seized two oil tankers off the coast of Venezuela last month as part of its blockade. The Bella 1 was one of a number of sanctioned oil tankers operating near Venezuela that have recently changed their flags to Russia.",
      "The Kremlin, a strong supporter of deposed President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accused the U.S. of violating maritime law by seizing the ship."

      "Though capable of carrying a nuclear warhead, the Oreshnik missile can also carry conventional warheads, as in this attack. Analysts have questioned the weapon's utility, and its deployment  appeared to be the Kremlin's latest attempt to send a threatening message to Kyiv and the West with peace talks stalled.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said early Friday that it had carried out the \u201cmassive strike\u201d against critically important targets in response to an alleged Ukrainian drone strike late last year on a residence used by President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The United States and others have rejected the Kremlin\u2019s claims, saying the residence was not targeted. Ukraine has dismissed it as a \u201clie\u201d intended to distract from Russia\u2019s reluctance to agree to a deal to end its nearly four-year war.",
      "The mayor of the western city of Lviv, Andriy Sadovy, said it was the first time his city was hit by a ballistic missile. \"This is a new level of threat \u2014 not only for Ukraine, but also for the security of Europe,\" he said in a video message on Telegram.",
      "The Russian attack was conducted using long-range, high-precision weapons based on land and at sea, the defense ministry said in a statement, including the Oreshnik hypersonic missile system.",
      "The targets included facilities involved in the production of drones used in the alleged attack on Putin\u2019s residence, as well as energy infrastructure \u201csupporting the operation of Ukraine\u2019s military-industrial complex,\u201d the ministry said, adding that \u201cthe objectives of the strike were achieved.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny terrorist actions by the criminal Ukrainian regime will continue to be met with a response,\u201d the ministry said.",
      "In addition to the Oreshnik medium-range ballistic missile, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the nationwide attack involved nearly 250 drones and dozens of ballistic and cruise missiles. At least four people, including a paramedic, died in Kyiv, Zelenskyy said in a post on X.",
      "He called for a global response, especially from the United States, \"whose signals Russia truly pays attention to.\"",
      "The strike was criticized by the leaders of Britain, France and Germany as \"escalatory and unacceptable,\" the U.K. said in a readout of a joint call.",
      "While Russia presented what it said was evidence of the alleged attack on Putin\u2019s residence on the shore of Lake Valdai in the northern Russian region of Novgorod, it failed to convince observers.",
      "Though President Donald Trump initially said he was \u201cvery angry\u201d after hearing about about the alleged attack directly from Putin, he said this week that U.S. officials had determined the residence was not targeted.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in Kyiv on Thursday warned of \u201ca potentially significant air attack that may occur at any time over the next several days.\u201d",
      "The conventionally armed version of the Oreshnik missile was previously used in late 2024, in what Putin said was a response to Ukraine\u2019s use of long-range Western weapons to hit targets inside Russia for the first time.",
      "Putin said at the time that there were \u201cno means of intercepting\u201d the intermediate-range ballistic missile, and that Russia would continue to test it. He bragged that the Oreshnik could reach speeds of up to Mach 10, ten times the speed of sound.",
      "A Russian government portal describes Oreshnik's maximum strike range as 3,417 miles. It said the missile can deliver warheads with a total yield equivalent to 45 atomic bombs dropped on the Japanese city of Hiroshima in 1945.",
      "Putin said last month that the Oreshnik, which means \u201cHazelnut tree\u201d in Russian, had officially entered combat duty.",
      "Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, Russia's closest ally whose territory Russia used as a launchpad for invading Ukraine in 2022, said in December that Moscow had deployed the Oreshnik missile system to his country.

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the U.S. from international organizations affiliated with the United Nations leaves the country without a meaningful voice in global climate talks.",
      "In an executive order Wednesday, Trump suspended U.S. support for 66 international bodies and commissions, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which the U.S. joined in 1992, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which produces the world\u2019s premier climate reports.",
      "In a post on X, the White House said the organizations \u201cno longer serve American interests.\u201d",
      "The move is yet another sign that the Trump administration is abandoning all efforts to fight climate change, rolling back these policies at a time when global warming is making weather disasters more frequent and intense across the country. Extreme events like wildfires, floods and hurricanes already cost the U.S. tens of billions of dollars every year. In 2025, 23 weather and climate events exceeded $1 billion in damages, costing a total of around $115 billion, according to an analysis released Thursday by the nonprofit organization Climate Central.",
      "The withdrawal is an escalation of the U.S.\u2019 rejection of climate diplomacy under Trump, further isolating the country from the global aim of slowing warming and staving off the most catastrophic effects of climate change.",
      "Trump began the process of pulling the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement in January 2025. The accord, signed in 2016, stipulated that the 195 participating nations would work to limit greenhouse gas emissions to ensure that the planet wouldn\u2019t warm more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), with an upper limit of 2 degrees C.",
      "The UNFCCC created the underlying structure that the Paris Agreement later built upon. It was established in 1992 to inventory and begin to address the primary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. President George Bush signed the treaty after the Senate delivered its consent in a two-thirds vote.",
      "If the U.S. completes its exit from the UNFCCC \u2014 a process that takes a year \u2014 it would be the first country ever to do so. Re-entering the UNFCCC treaty would require a new two-thirds vote from the Senate, so Trump\u2019s withdrawal could make it difficult for a future president to rejoin the Paris Agreement.",
      "Withdrawing from the UNFCCC would also leave the U.S. as one of the only nations without representation at international climate talks. Already, the White House declined to send an official delegation to the latest U.N. climate summit, COP30, in Brazil last fall.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at all these conventions and the history of participation, even when countries were not really actively engaged in negotiations, it\u2019s pretty astonishing to walk away from the table and have decisions taken without your input,\u201d said Kristie Ebi, a climate scientist at the University of Washington who has contributed to several Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports.",
      "Previous U.S. administrations have not always been enthusiastic participants in international climate discussions, Ebi added, but they still kept tabs on them.",
      "\u201cPeople showed up, sat in the back and did crossword puzzles and never said a word, but they wanted to hear what the discussions were,\u201d she said. Now, \u201cit\u2019s isolation.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has expressed open hostility for the UNFCCC and other international organizations. In a statement on X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them \u201canti-American, useless or wasteful.\u201d",
      "The U.S. will officially exit the Paris Agreement on Jan. 27 \u2014 roughly a year after the Trump administration initiated the nation\u2019s exit from the deal.",
      "However, legal questions remain as to whether Trump has the power to exit the UNFCCC without Congress\u2019 consent.",
      "Jean Su, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity who directs its energy justice program, said her organization views the move as illegal.",
      "\u201cThe Constitution has articulated what it takes to get into a treaty, which is two-thirds of the Senate majority, but it is actually silent on what it takes to leave a treaty,\u201d Su said. \u201cThere has not been affirmative case law either way as to whether a president can unilaterally pull out of a treaty that was approved by two-thirds of the Senate. So we are looking at legal action.\u201d",
      "The UNFCCC is the world\u2019s facilitator of global climate negotiations. Each year, a host country organizes a Conference of the Parties (COP), in which all participating nations meet to discuss things like emission targets and how to fund climate action globally. Last year\u2019s meeting focused, in part, on the Amazon rainforest and how to address deforestation and climate effects there. The UNFCCC secretariat helps organize these events, creating a structure and facilitating the meetings.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like hosting the Olympics \u2014 you don\u2019t do that without the organization to help,\u201d Ebi said.",
      "When the U.S. left the Paris Agreement, it created a budget hole for the UNFCCC. Bloomberg Philanthropies, the charity organization of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, stepped in to fill that gap and keep the secretariat operating.",
      "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), meanwhile, is an independent body designed to provide policymakers with the best science about climate change, its effects and how it could be addressed. This organization\u2019s reports form the scientific understanding for UNFCCC discussions and treaties.",
      "In a statement, Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UNFCCC, said Trump\u2019s exit \u201cwill leave the US less secure and less prosperous.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe doors remain open for the US to reenter in the future, as it has in the past with the Paris Agreement,\u201d he added.",
      "Throughout his first year in office, Trump has made climate programs a target of dramatic budget cuts. He has called climate change a \u201ccon job,\u201d and the administration has taken steps to scuttle or downplay key climate reports, including the National Climate Assessment. It is working to remove the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s ability to regulate the greenhouse gas pollution that causes global warming.",
      "Former Vice President Al Gore, a climate activist, said Wednesday on X that the Trump administration has been \u201cturning its back on the climate crisis since day one,\u201d accusing it of catering to the interests of the oil industry while \u201cendangering people in America and around the world.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy withdrawing from the IPCC, UNFCCC, and the other vital international partnerships, the Trump Administration is undoing decades of hard-won diplomacy, attempting to undermine climate science, and sowing distrust around the world,\u201d Gore said."

      "The American operation to take over the Bella 1 in the North Atlantic after a high-seas chase that began off Venezuela was \u201ca gross violation\u201d of maritime law, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said Thursday. It expressed \u201cregret and concern\u201d over Washington\u2019s \u201creadiness to generate acute international crisis situations.\u201d",
      "The saga has highlighted the mixed response in the country to the fallout from the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "While Moscow officially condemned the attack, its messaging has been restrained.",
      "Russia may be reluctant to anger Trump at a precarious moment for the Ukraine peace talks, especially as his approach to Venezuela appears to validate its view of the world as divided into great-power spheres of influence. And despite the complications for the Kremlin and its war effort, some influential voices have expressed jealousy at the effectiveness of the American operation.",
      "Out of the shadows",
      "After a weekslong chase across the Atlantic, the U.S. took over the Bella 1 on Wednesday in an operation that defied Russian warnings.",
      "The ship had changed its name to the Marinera and hoisted a Russian flag after escaping the U.S. blockade of Venezuela last month.",
      "On the U.S. sanctions list since June 2024, it was a \u201cposter child\u201d for the shadow fleet operations, said Richard Meade, editor-in-chief of Lloyd\u2019s List Intelligence, a maritime data analysis company.",
      "\u201cIt has operated out of Iran, out of Russia, out of Venezuela. It\u2019s done all of it, and it\u2019s done all of it while cycling through various false identities, false flags, with questionable or no insurance. It\u2019s exactly what the shadow fleet is there to do. It\u2019s to operate in the shadows,\u201d Meade told NBC News in a phone interview Thursday.",
      "Ships like it smuggle oil for countries facing international sanctions, such as Venezuela, Russia and Iran, and often conceal or spoof their location data. Many are barely seaworthy and often engage in ship-to-ship transfers of their cargo while at sea in an effort to obscure the oil\u2019s origin.",
      "Data from the International Maritime Organization ship registry shows that the tanker\u2019s registered owner is a company called Burevestmarine LLC, headquartered in Russia\u2019s western Ryazan region. The company appears in Russia\u2019s state commercial register and lists Ilya Bugai as the company\u2019s director. NBC News could not immediately identify a way to contact Bugai.",
      "Russia has faced a slew of new sanctions in the aftermath of its invasion of Ukraine, including on its oil. It has resorted to using the shadow fleet to sell its discounted crude oil to allies to keep afloat its economy, which has required enormous military investment to sustain the war.",
      "According to the Kyiv School of Economics\u2019 year-end analysis, Russia\u2019s shadow fleet continues to play a key role in transporting Russian oil. Its \u201cRussian Oil Tracker\u201d estimates that 173 Russian shadow fleet tankers carrying crude oil and oil products departed Russian ports and engaged in ship-to-ship transfers in the month of November.",
      "For years, Kyiv has been calling for a greater crackdown on Russia\u2019s shadow fleet.",
      "\u201cPutin uses these tankers to finance his war, and most of these vessels are old, poorly maintained, and operate without any oversight,\u201d Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in late 2024. His foreign minister, Andrii Sybiha, said Wednesday that Ukraine welcomed the tanker\u2019s seizure and Trump\u2019s \u201cact, not fear\u201d approach.",
      "And while the seizure of the Bella 1 is unlikely to break the Russian economy, it adds a layer of complexity for the Kremlin and leaves the fate of other tankers uncertain.",
      "At least three other sanctioned oil tankers that were operating near Venezuela in recent weeks have also changed their flags to Russia\u2019s, according to the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping.",
      "\u201cRussia is increasingly taking direct control of its export capabilities,\u201d said Meade. \u201cAnd certainly in the last four months, we have seen a rapid increase of shadow fleet ships flagging to Russia. Now, given that they were unable to protect the Marinera, the question is, Will shadow fleet operators be quite so willing to move into Russia, and will Russia really want to keep pursuing that agenda of taking direct control of the shadow fleet?\u201d",
      "A lot now depends on whether the U.S., and to some extent the European Union and the U.K., are going to be prepared to execute seizures like the one conducted on Wednesday to try and disrupt those exports via shadow fleet ships.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this was an anomaly or the start of a pattern of more robust enforcement,\u201d Meade said.",
      "What it means for Ukraine",
      "That uncertainty could be the reason behind Russia\u2019s muted response to the tanker seizure so far.",
      "While some Russian lawmakers have called it \u201cpiracy on the high seas,\u201d Russia\u2019s foreign ministry appealed for \u201chumane\u201d treatment of the tanker\u2019s crew even as it urged Washington \u201cto return to compliance with the fundamental norms and principles of international maritime navigation\u201d on Thursday.",
      "There has been no reaction from the Kremlin\u2019s spokesperson or Putin himself.",
      "Moscow may want to be careful not to offend Trump while he is negotiating a peace deal in Ukraine that at times has seen him support Russia\u2019s hard-line demands.",
      "It could also explain why Putin has not personally addressed the U.S. attack on Venezuela.",
      "The operation to remove Maduro is a blow to the Kremlin, depriving it of a longtime ally. But what Moscow\u2019s foreign ministry condemned as an \u201cact of armed aggression\u201d left some of its influential military bloggers jealous of Washington\u2019s success.",
      "When Putin invaded Ukraine in February 2022, he hoped to take Kyiv and capture Zelenskyy in as little as three days, expecting little resistance from Ukraine's army. His plan centered on seizing the Hostomel airfield, a crucial staging post for an assault on the capital, but Putin\u2019s forces got bogged down and eventually withdrew.",
      "Trump\u2019s removal of Maduro, which took hours and resulted in no U.S. deaths, drew admiration and unfavorable comparisons from Russia\u2019s so-called \u201cZ bloggers.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost likely, our own special military operation was conceived in much the same way: fast, effective,\u201d wrote prominent channel Two Majors, referring to the Kremlin\u2019s term for its war in Ukraine. Another prominent Z-blogger, Voenny Osvedomitel, called it a \u201cmodel military operation.\u201d",
      "Still, the focus on Venezuela could help distract from Putin\u2019s reticence to strike a deal with Ukraine.",
      "And Trump\u2019s stated desire to dominate the Western Hemisphere lends validation to the ideas underpinning the Kremlin\u2019s war: that great powers should be entitled to spheres of influence. In Putin\u2019s eyes, at least, Russia\u2019s sphere includes former Soviet states like Ukraine."
