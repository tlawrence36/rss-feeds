      "In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- In a bid to kickoff a new era for DC Studios, James Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman\u201d opened with $122 million in U.S. and Canada ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "DC and Warner Bros. had a lot riding on \u201cSuperman.\u201d While the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s Marvel Studios has had its own share of struggles, the superheroes of DC have recently found mostly kryptonite in theaters. Films like \u201cJoker: Folie \u00e0 Deux,\u201d \u201cThe Flash\u201d and \u201cShazam! Fury of the Gods\u201d all flopped.",
      "But \u201cSuperman,\u201d written and directed by Gunn, is intended as a new start. It\u2019s the first release fully steered by Gunn and Peter Safran, co-heads of DC Studios, since they were handed the keys to DC\u2019s superhero cinematic universe.",
      "And while Gunn turned \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d into a massive success for Marvel, his irreverent, idiosyncratic touch made the director \u2014 once a B-movie filmmaker with Troma Entertainment \u2014 an unlikely steward for one of the movies\u2019 most bankable and beloved brands.",
      "The roughly on-target opening was the third largest of 2025, and the first DC title to surpass $100 million in its opening weekend since \u201cWonder Woman\u201d in 2017.",
      "Ticket sales were relatively soft for \u201cSuperman\u201d overseas. In 78 international markets, it grossed $95 million. In China, it collected just $6.6 million.",
      "As an American icon, \u201cSuperman\u201d inevitably attracted political discourse. Some right-wing commentators criticized the movie as \u201cwoke\u201d after Gunn described the superhero from Krypton as \u201can immigrant.\u201d On X, the White House posted an image of President Donald Trump as Superman.",
      "In \u201cSuperman,\u201d which cost about $225 million to make, Gunn steers the Man of Steel in a drastically different tonal direction than in previous iterations from filmmaker Zack Snyder. Skipping the Kansas origin story, the film instead picks up with Superman ( David Corenswet ) after his first defeat. Rachel Brosnahan plays Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult is Lex Luthor.",
      "The \u201cSuperman\u201d debut didn\u2019t come close to besting the $166 million launch for Snyder\u2019s \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d in 2016. But it did open higher, not accounting for inflation, than Snyder\u2019s \u201cMan of Steel.\u201d That film debuted with $116 million in 2013.",
      "But while Snyder\u2019s films were often unloved by critics, largely good reviews greeted Gunn\u2019s \u201cSuperman.\u201d On Rotten Tomatoes, it scored 82% fresh \u2014 the best for the franchise since the first two movies with Christopher Reeve: \u201cSuperman\u201d (1978) and \u201cSuperman II\u201d (1980). Audiences gave it an \u201cA-\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "\u201cSuperman\u201d faced sizeable competition too. Last week\u2019s top film, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth,\u201d slid to second place with $40 million. With \u201cSuperman\u201d soaking up many large-format screens, Universal Pictures\u2019 seventh \u201cJurassic\u201d film slipped a steep 57% from its opening weekend. Starring Scarlett Johansson, \u201cJurassic World Rebirth\u201d got off to a thunderous $318.3 million global start. In two weeks, it\u2019s amassed $529.5 million worldwide.",
      "Also still in the mix is Apple Studios\u2019 biggest box-office success yet, \u201cF1.\u201d Joseph Kosinski\u2019s Formula One action thriller, starring Brad Pitt, came in third with $13 million in its third weekend. The film, distributed by Warner Bros., has collected $393.4 million globally in three weeks. But it also carries a hefty price tag of roughly $250 million, plus at least $100 million in promotion.",

      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown season seven's winning couple Sunday evening after a tumultuous season",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 \u201cLove Island USA\u201d will crown the winning couple of its seventh season Sunday evening, culminating a tumultuous summer full of explosive breakups and shock exits.",
      "The finale will air on Peacock at 6 p.m. Pacific/9 p.m. Eastern, following a chart-topping run since the season premiered on June 3. The show brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "The show, an American spinoff to the UK series, has shaken up reality TV, becoming Peacock\u2019s most watched entertainment series on mobile devices, according to NBC Universal.",
      "This season follows breakout success from last summer, which captured mainstream attention. \u201cLove Island: Beyond the Villa,\u201d a new series spinoff premiering Sunday, follows Season 6's main cast as they navigate relationships, life and newfound social media fame in Los Angeles.",
      "This season has also been under fire as two contestants \u2013 Cierra Ortega and Yulissa Escobar \u2013 left the villa following resurfaced posts in which they used racial slurs.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained a slur against Asian people. She apologized for the resurfaced posts in a nearly five minute TikTok video Wednesday.",
      "Friday's episode saw the elimination of Ace Greene and Chelley Bissainthe, setting the stage for the finale. Green and Bissainthe were the only couple to maintain a relationship throughout most of the show.",
      "With $100,000 up for grabs for the winning couple, here\u2019s a look at the season\u2019s run and the final four couples heading into the finale.",
      "Stripped of their phones and connection with the outside world, five men and five women arrive in the villa and coupled up based on initial romantic interest. Throughout the season, the show introduces a steady stream of bombshells, new contestants who are brought in to disrupt existing relationships and build new storylines.",
      "Under constant surveillance, contestants partook in kissing competitions, heart rate challenges and drama-inducing games ripe for viral moments. The final six couples even became instant parents, startled awake by cries as they were tasked with taking care of baby dolls to further test their romantic connections.",
      "Halfway through the season, established couples were temporarily separated for Casa Amor, the show's ultimate test, and encouraged to explore new relationships with a fresh group of single contestants.",
      "Contestants are routinely dumped from the villa, removed either by a public vote or by the islanders themselves.",
      "Amaya Espinal, 25, made waves when she walked in as a bombshell early in the season and has been credited for some of the season\u2019s most viral moments.",
      "\u201cI never said I was perfect. I never said I didn\u2019t have any flaws. But at least I\u2019m pretty, and at least I\u2019m a little funny, and at least I\u2019m my own best friend,\u201d Espinal sang to herself in the makeup room, which prompted various covers online and inspired a Google pop-up message when you search up her nickname, Amaya Papaya.",
      "The New York City native, who labeled herself a \u201csensitive gangster,\u201d tested various connections, including Greene, Austin Shepard and Casa Amor contestant Zak Srakaew, that all fizzled out. Her previous partners on the show said Espinal, who is Dominican, expressed affection too quickly.",
      "A connection sparked between Espinal and Bryan Arenales, 28, a Casa Amor contestant, late in the season after he defended her, saying that \u201ccoming from a Hispanic household, calling someone babe, mi amor, mi vida, that\u2019s just how we talk.\u201d Arenales is from Boston and is of Puerto Rican and Guatemalan descent, according to his Instagram page.",
      "\u201cI always stress that as I get older, it\u2019s important to be with someone that keeps you young. I definitely think Amaya is that type of person,\u201d Arenales said during a confessional interview.",
      "Huda Mustafa, 24, and Chris Seeley, 27, explored different connections in Casa Amor before expressing interest in each other and eventually recoupling.",
      "Mustafa, from North Carolina, is the first contestant in the series to be a mother, which caused tension with her initial \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Jeremiah Brown. The two coupled up and developed a strong connection very quickly, causing the other contestants to doubt their relationship.",
      "Mustafa and Brown, 25, had a turbulent experience, leading to some of the most viral arguments of the season. The two eventually broke off their relationship and Brown was dumped from the villa halfway through the season.",
      "Mustafa explored other connections but remained single until Casa Amor, where she built a connection with Seeley, who was initially interested in Bissainthe.",
      "The two quickly developed an unexpected connection, bonding over Seeley's struggles with leaving his overseas basketball career and Huda\u2019s difficult experience with motherhood.",
      "\u201cI think me and her are actually really good for each other,\u201d Seeley said during a confessional interview. \u201cShe helps me kind of get out of my head and I help her, you know, be her true self and I calm her down in moments where she gets emotional or heated.\u201d",
      "The two hit a snag during the show\u2019s baby challenge, where they argued over Mustafa\u2019s lack of public displays of affection.",
      "Iris Kendall, 25, and Jose \u201cPepe\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez, 27, came in as bombshells with fellow contestant Jalen Brown in the ninth episode and explored various connections before coming together in the show\u2019s last recoupling.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez initially formed a strong connection with Hannah Fields, 23, which was cut short when a shocking dumping forced her to leave the villa and left him single.",
      "Kendall initially coupled up with Brown before he was dumped from the villa along with Fields. She developed a strong connection with TJ Palma, 23, who walked in as a bombshell in episode 15, and they became a couple.",
      "Garcia-Gonzalez coupled up with Gracyn Blackmore, 25, during Casa Amor. Each respective couple remained together until Blackmore and Palma left the villa following a mass dumping late in the season, leaving both Kendall and Garcia-Gonzalez single.",
      "The pair, who had developed a strong friendship, then coupled up and started a romantic relationship.",
      "\u201cWith Iris, it just feels comfortable. I think it\u2019s that whole, you know, you\u2019re friends to start and then maybe it can become something else,\u201d Garcia-Gonzalez said during a confessional interview.",
      "Olandria Carthen, 27, and Nic Vansteenberghe, 24, had an unconventional path to the finale.",
      "The pair had expressed initial interest in each other during the first episode, before settling into separate couples. Carthen, an Alabama native, was set on finding her \u201ccowboy,\u201d coupling up with Taylor Williams, 24, from Oklahoma. The pair remained together for most of the season, though Williams sporadically mentioned he lacked a physical connection with Carthen.",
      "Vansteenberghe initially coupled up with Belle-A Walker, 22, before choosing to recouple with Ortega, who walked in as a bombshell at the end of the first episode. The pair remained together throughout the show until her abrupt departure from the villa a week ago.",
      "During Casa Amor, Carthen and Vansteenberghe didn\u2019t didn't find new connections and they were dumped from the villa. In a shocking twist, however, the contestants were offered a lifeline \u2014 they could return to the villa if they couple up with each other. The pair then briefly explored a romantic connection before ultimately deciding to remain friends.",
      "Carthen chose to return to Williams but was left single after he recoupled with Casa Amor contestant Clarke Carraway. Vansteenberghe and Ortega stayed together, but her departure days later ultimately left him single.",
      "Carthen and Vansteenberghe ultimately recoupled in the same episode.",
      "\u201cFor our journey to be almost identical is mind-blowing to me. I can\u2019t wrap my head around this situation,\u201d Carthen said during a recent confessional interview. \u201cMaybe it was Nic this whole time and we\u2019ve just been so oblivious to it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he is considering \u201ctaking away\u201d the U.S. citizenship of a longtime rival, actress and comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell, despite a decades-old Supreme Court ruling that expressly prohibits such an action by the government.",
      "\u201cBecause of the fact that Rosie O\u2019Donnell is not in the best interests of our Great Country, I am giving serious consideration to taking away her Citizenship,\u201d Trump wrote in a social media post on Saturday. He added that O'Donnell, who moved to Ireland in January, should stay in Ireland \u201cif they want her.\u201d",
      "The two have criticized each other publicly for years, an often bitter back-and-forth that predates Trump\u2019s involvement in politics. In recent days, O\u2019Donnell on social media denounced Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",
      "It's just the latest threat by Trump to revoke the citizenship of people with whom he has publicly disagreed, most recently his former adviser and one-time ally, Elon Musk.",
      "But O'Donnell's situation is notably different from Musk, who was born in South Africa. O'Donnell was born in the United States and has a constitutional right to U.S. citizenship. The U.S. State Department notes on its website that U.S. citizens by birth or naturalization may relinquish U.S. nationality by taking certain steps \u2013 but only if the act is performed voluntary and with the intention of relinquishing U.S. citizenship.",
      "Amanda Frost, a law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, noted the Supreme Court ruled in a 1967 case that the Fourteen Amendment of the Constitution prevents the government from taking away citizenship.",
      "\u201cThe president has no authority to take away the citizenship of a native-born U.S. citizen,\" Frost said in an email Saturday. \u201cIn short, we are nation founded on the principle that the people choose the government; the government cannot choose the people.\u201d",
      "O'Donnell moved to Ireland after Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris to win his second term. She has said she's in the process of obtaining Irish citizenship based on family lineage.",
      "Responding to Trump Saturday, O\u2019Donnell wrote on social media that she had upset the president and \u201cadd me to the list of people who oppose him at every turn.\u201d",

      "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico -- In a small bookstore in the Caribbean's largest mall, dozens of people gathered on a recent evening for the launch of a slim dictionary. Its title is \u201cThe ABC of DtMF,\u201d which is short for \u201cDeB\u00cd TiRAR M\u00e1S FOToS,\u201d the newest album from Puerto Rico's latest prodigious son, Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio, better known as Bad Bunny.",
      "The mostly older crowd flipped through the pages, seeking to understand more about Puerto Rico's culture, the places, phrases and references in Bad Bunny's music.",
      "The singer has elevated the global profile of the island, a U.S. territory, to new heights, promoting its traditional music, denouncing its gentrification and challenging its political status.",
      "It was an unexpected opportunity for an island that for years has cried out about its territorial status, dwindling affordable housing, high cost of living, chronic power outages, medical exodus and fragile economy. Pleas for change have been largely pushed aside, but Puerto Ricans are optimistic that Bad Bunny\u2019s new album and his series of 30 concerts that began Friday means they\u2019ll finally be heard.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to bring change, and there\u2019s a young generation who\u2019s going to back him,\u201d said Luis Rosado, 57, who this week attended the dictionary launch at the urging of his son, who lives abroad.",
      "Ten minutes before the first concert on Friday, a giant billboard on stage lit up with the words, \u201cPuerto Rico is a colony since Christopher Columbus \u2018discovered\u2019 the island during his second trip to the New World in 1493.\u201d",
      "The crowd that filled the 18,000-capacity coliseum whooped.",
      "\u201cThis album has sparked a conversation around the world about our situation as a colony,\u201d said Andrea Figueroa, a 24-year-old professional athlete who said foreigners have started to ask her about Puerto Rico and its issues, something she hopes might lead to change.",
      "Those born on the island of 3.2 million inhabitants are U.S. citizens but cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, and they have one representative in Congress with limited voting powers.",
      "Figueroa said the album resonated with her because her father is one of thousands forced to leave the island in search of work as the economy crumbled. It\u2019s a sentiment Bad Bunny sings about in \u201cWhat happened to Hawaii,\u201d with the lyric, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to go to Orlando, but the corrupt ones kicked him out.\u201d",
      "The song taps into concern that the Puerto Rican identity is eroding amid an influx of people from the U.S. mainland, many of them attracted by a 2012 law that allows Americans to move to the island and pay no taxes on capital gains if they meet certain conditions.",
      "Hundreds of Americans also snapped up properties in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria struck the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in 2017, forcing more than 100,000 people to leave.",
      "\u201cThey want to take the river away from me and also the beach; they want my neighborhood and the grandma to leave,\u201d Bad Bunny sang on Friday as the crowd drowned out his voice.",
      "The artist spent half of Friday\u2019s concert singing from the porch and roof of a traditional Puerto Rican home that served as a second stage, where he wonders about its fate aloud because it\u2019s been rented: \u201cDo good people live there? Is it an Airbnb?\u201d",
      "The mostly young crowd booed loudly, flinching at their reality on an island where the housing price index increased by almost 60% from 2018 to 2024 and where short-term rentals have surged from some 1,000 in 2014 to more than 25,000 in 2023.",
      "However, they cheered upon seeing Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James emerge from the house as a surprise guest.",
      "The song hit Carmen Lourdes L\u00f3pez Rivera especially hard. She is the vice president of the Community Board Association of La Perla, an impoverished community once known for being Puerto Rico\u2019s biggest heroin distribution point.",
      "Investors with deep pockets have long sought to buy up the area, which is perched on a hill with deep turquoise waters lapping below a massive 16th-century fort popular with tourists.",
      "\u201cThey have always said they want to kick us out of here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to fight for what belongs to us.\u201d",
      "The effect of Bad Bunny\u2019s album and concerts is already being felt.",
      "More than 35,000 hotel nights have been booked during the normally slow summer season, with the concerts expected to attract more than 600,000 visitors, generate more than $186 million and create more than 3,600 jobs, according to government officials.",
      "Beyond that, Bad Bunny\u2019s use of folkloric music like bomba and plena has revived interest in those musical traditions. Dozens of newcomers have requested classes and are seeking out teachers, said Jorge Gabriel L\u00f3pez Ol\u00e1n, 28, an experienced drummer.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s very necessary, isn\u2019t it? To understand where we come from and where our music and culture come from,\u201d he said.",
      "On Friday, Bad Bunny fans sported long ruffled skirts traditionally worn to dance bomba, while others donned straw hats known as a \u201cpava,\u201d worn by \u201cj\u00edbaros,\u201d Puerto Rican peasants. Musicians and dancers wore the same outfits on the main stage, which at one point even featured live chickens.",
      "Interest has surged to the point where universities including Princeton and Yale have launched courses on Bad Bunny. Albert Laguna, a Yale professor, described Bad Bunny\u2019s residence as a powerful move: \u201cInstead of me going to the world, right, I\u2019m going to start here.\u201d",
      "There is even renewed interest in the Puerto Rican crested toad, the island\u2019s sole indigenous toad species that is under threat and was featured in a video as part of Bad Bunny\u2019s newest album.",
      "Not even two weeks had passed since the album\u2019s launch and people already were sending in pictures to confirm if they had spotted the crested toad, said Abel Vale Nieves with Citizens of the Karst, an environmental nonprofit.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we had not seen before,\u201d he said, adding that the album presented Puerto Rico\u2019s reality to the world: \u201cA situation of complete disadvantage where we don\u2019t have the right to a lot of things.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt creates interest in Puerto Rico\u2019s historical situation, and I think it did so in a wonderful way,\u201d he said, adding that the concerts will only boost visibility of the island\u2019s issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful opportunity.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "\u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\" is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a new 4K restoration and a theatrical re-release",
      "Jack Nicholson did not want to go to the Oscars. It was 1976 and he was nominated for best actor in \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest.\u201d The Milo\u0161 Forman film, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary with a nationwide theatrical re-release on July 13 and July 16, had become a bit of a sensation \u2014 the second highest grossing picture of 1975, behind \u201cJaws,\u201d and had received nine Oscar nominations.",
      "But Nicholson wasn\u2019t feeling optimistic. In five years, he\u2019d already been nominated five times. He\u2019d also lost five times. And he told his producer, Michael Douglas, that he couldn\u2019t go through it again.",
      "\u201cI remember how hard I had to persuade Jack to come to the ceremony. He was so reluctant, but we got him there,\u201d Douglas said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd then of course we lost the first four awards. Jack was sitting right in front of me and sort of leaned back and said \u2019Oh, Mikey D, Mikey D, I told you, man.\u2019 I just said, \u2018Hang in there.\u2019\u201d",
      "Douglas, of course, was right. \u201cOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d would go on to sweep the \u201cbig five\u201d \u2014 screenplay, director, actor, actress and picture \u2014 the first film to do so in 41 years, (\u201cIt Happened One Night,\u201d in 1934) which only \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs\u201d has done since. That night was one of many vindicating moments for a film that no one wanted to make or distribute that has quite literally stood the test of time.",
      "\u201cThis is my first 50th anniversary,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first movie I ever produced. To have a movie that\u2019s so lasting, that people get a lot out of, it\u2019s a wonderful feeling. It\u2019s bringing back a lot of great memories.\u201d",
      "The film adaption of Ken Kesey\u2019s countercultural novel was a defining moment for Douglas, a son of Hollywood who was stuck in television and got a lifeline to film when his father, Kirk Douglas, gave him the rights to the book, and many of the then-unknown cast like Danny DeVito and Christopher Lloyd.",
      "DeVito was actually the first person officially cast. Douglas, who\u2019d known him for nearly 10 years, brought Forman to see him play Martini on stage.",
      "\u201cMilo\u0161 said, \u2018Yes! Danny! Perfect! Cast!\u2019 Douglas said in his best Czech accent. \u201cIt was a big moment for Danny. But I always knew how talented he was.\u201d",
      "Though the film's themes are challenging, unlike many of its New Hollywood contemporaries it wasn\u2019t a tortured shoot by any stretch. They had their annoyances (like Forman refusing to show the cast dailies) and more serious trials (they found out halfway through production that William Redfield was dying of leukemia), but for the most part it was fun.",
      "\u201cWe were very serious about the work, because Milo\u0161 was very serious. And we had the material, Kesey\u2019s work, and the reverence for that. We were not frivolous about it. But we did have a ball doing it,\u201d DeVito said, laughing.",
      "Part of that is because they filmed on location at a real state hospital in Salem, Oregon. Everyone stayed in the same motel and would board the same bus in the morning to get to set. It would have been hard not to bond and even harder if they hadn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cThere was full commitment,\u201d Douglas said. \u201cThat comes when you don\u2019t go home at night to your own lives. We stopped for lunch on the first day and I saw Jack kind of push his tray away and go outside to get some air. I said, \u2018Jack, you OK?\u2019 He said, \u2019Who are these guys? Nobody breaks character! It\u2019s lunch time and they\u2019re all acting the same way!'\u201d",
      "Not disproving Nicholson\u2019s point, DeVito remembers he and the cast even asked if they could just sleep in the hospital.",
      "\u201cThey wouldn\u2019t let us,\u201d DeVito said. \u201cThe floor above us had some seriously disturbed people who had committed murder.\u201d",
      "The film will be in theaters again on July 13 and July 16 from Fathom Entertainment. It\u2019s a new 4K restoration from the Academy Film Archive and Teatro Della Pace Films with an introduction by Leonard Maltin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous print and reminds me how good the sound was,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "DeVito thinks it, \u201cholds up in a really big way, because Milo\u0161 really was paying attention to all great things in the screenplay and the story originally.\u201d",
      "Besides the shock of \u201choly Toledo, am I that old?\u201d DeVito said that it was a treasure to be part of \u2014 and he continues to see his old friends, including Douglas, Lloyd and, of course, Nicholson, who played the protagonist, R.P. McMurphy.",
      "One person Douglas thinks hasn\u2019t gotten the proper attention for his contributions to \u201cCuckoo\u2019s Nest\u201d is producer Saul Zaentz, who died in 2014. His music company, Fantasy Records who had Creedence Clearwater Revival, funded the endeavor which started at a $1.6 million budget and ballooned to $4 million by the end. He was a gambler, Douglas said, and it paid off.",
      "And whatever sour grapes might have existed between Douglas and his father, who played R.P. McMurphy on Broadway and dreamt of doing so on film, were perhaps over-exaggerated. It was ultimately important for their relationship.",
      "\u201cMcMurphy is as good a part as any actor is going to get, and I\u2019m now far enough in my career to understand maybe you have four, maybe five good parts, really great parts. I\u2019m sure for dad that was one of them,\u201d Douglas said.",
      "\u201cTo not be able to see it through was probably disappointing on one side. On the other, the fact that his son did it and the picture turned out so good? Thank God the picture turned out. It would have been a disaster if it hadn\u2019t.\"",
      "Douglas added: \u201cIt was a fairy tale from beginning to end. I doubt anything else really came close to it. Even my Oscar for best actor years later didn\u2019t really surpass that moment very early in my career.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Forty years ago, the legendary Live Aid concerts aimed to do a lot of good \u2014 helping to raise over $100 million for famine relief in Ethiopia and inspiring worldwide awareness for a cause it might otherwise have ignored.",
      "Simulcast from Philadelphia and London on July 13, 1985, Live Aid was the most ambitious global television event of its time: 16 hours of live music in two different continents featuring Queen, The Who, a Led Zeppelin reunion and more.",
      "A lot has changed in the years since. \u201cLive Aid, '85 to now, is the same distance as the Second World War from Live Aid,\u201d notes Rick Springfield, laughingly. \u201cThat\u2019s how long ago it was.\u201d",
      "Artists who performed at Live Aid \u2014 Springfield, organizer Bob Geldof, Hall and Oates' John Oates and Judas Priest's Rob Halford \u2014 reflected on the event and its impact in interviews with The Associated Press ahead of the 40th anniversary on Sunday.",
      "Here's what they had to say:",
      "At John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, Springfield performed between Run-DMC and REO Speedwagon \u2014 just a taste of the diversity of performers featured on the transnational lineup. \u201cRun-DMC, I remember thinking, \u2018What is this? Three guys talking over a record player. What is that? Little did I know that it was about to change the whole game,\u201d he says, laughing. He remembers playing an electric set \u2014 no \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl,\u201d because \u201cback then, it was just my first hit. ... It hadn't gone on to become this cultural thing.\"",
      "Hall and Oates' John Oates had a different experience. His band also played in Philly \u2014 their hometown \u2014 and in 1985, his band was one of the biggest on the planet. They played near the end of the night, joined by the Temptations' Eddie Kendricks and David Ruffin and remained on stage to back the Rolling Stones' dynamic frontman Mick Jagger. The British rockstar had a trick up his sleeve.",
      "\u201cHe didn't tell us that he was bringing Tina Turner out,\u201d Oates says. \u201cWe had rehearsed a certain amount of songs with him. But then when he brought her out, it just jacked up the level of energy like you can\u2019t believe.\u201d",
      "Judas Priest singer Rob Halford counts \u201cMike and Tina, of course,\u201d as one of his Philly Live Aid highlights. \u201cLed Zeppelin, too.\u201d",
      "But most exciting of all for the heavy metal frontman? Meeting folk hero Joan Baez. The band had previously covered her classic \u201cDiamonds and Rust.\"",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s gonna come and kick me in the ass for wrecking her beautiful song,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe gives me a quick hug and goes, \u2018The reason I\u2019m here is because my son said to me, if you see Rob Halford from Judas Priest at the Live Aid Show in Philadelphia, will you tell him from me that I prefer Judas Priest\u2019s version to my mom\u2019s version?' ... It was a display of such kindness.\"",
      "Twenty years after Live Aid, Geldof organized Live 8 \u2014 an even larger undertaking in the new internet era, with 10 concerts happening simultaneously and across the globe.",
      "If the trend were to continue, there should be another event taking place this year. Notably, there isn't.",
      "Geldof says that's because there couldn't be a Live Aid-type event in 2025. He cites social media as a cause. In his view, algorithmic fracturing has made it impossible to create monolithic musical and activistic moments. Instead, he views the current media landscape as bolstering \"an echo chamber of your own prejudices.\u201d",
      "For something like Live Aid to work, \u201cYou need rock \u2018n\u2019 roll as a creature of a social, economic and technological movement,\" he says. \u201cAnd I think the rock \u2018n\u2019 roll age is over. ... It did determine how young people articulated change and the desire for it. ... That isn't the case anymore.\u201d",
      "Springfield agrees. \u201cI think we are too divided,\u201d he says. He believes the world wouldn't be able to agree on a single cause to support, or even which musicians to back. \u201cYou could never do a thing with the size of Live Aid unless it was some kind of universal thing of, \u2018Let\u2019s bring everybody together.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cNever say never, but I highly doubt it,\u201d says Oates. \u201cThe landscape of music and entertainment in general has changed so drastically.\"",
      "He points to \u201cWe Are The World,\u201d the 1985 charity single for African famine relief that included the voices of Michael Jackson, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan, Ray Charles, Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder, Smokey Robinson, Paul Simon and many more, as an example. \u201cThe idea of that happening with the stars of today all in one place, I can\u2019t even imagine that.

      "Former \u201cLove Island USA\u201d contestant Cierra Ortega has released a video on TikTok apologizing for previously using a racial slur against Asian people",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Former \u201cLove Island USA\u201d contestant Cierra Ortega apologized Wednesday for resurfaced posts where she used a racial slur against Asian people.",
      "Ortega, who was half of one of the season\u2019s strongest couples, left the villa just a week before the popular reality show\u2019s finale after old posts resurfaced that contained the slur.",
      "Ortega addressed the entire Asian community in her nearly five minute TikTok video and said she is \u201cdeeply, truly, honestly so sorry.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not an apology video. This is an accountability video,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "\u201cI had no idea that the word held as much pain, as much harm, and came with the history that it did, or I never would have used it,\u201d Ortega said. \u201cI had no ill intention when I was using it, but that\u2019s absolutely no excuse because intent doesn\u2019t excuse ignorance.\u201d",
      "Ortega, who has been back in the United States for about 48 hours, said she has struggled most with the backlash experienced by her family, who she said doesn't feel safe in their own home, and have had immigration authorities called on them.",
      "\u201cThere's no need to fight hate with hate. I don't think that that's justice,\" Ortega said. \"And if you want to know that you're heard and that I'm sorry and that I will move differently, I promise you, that's what will happen.\u201d",
      "Ortega\u2019s removal from the villa was announced early in Sunday\u2019s episode. Host Iain Stirling said she had left \u201cdue to a personal situation.\u201d",
      "\u201cI completely agree with the network\u2019s decision to remove me from the villa. I think that this is something that deserved punishment and the punishment has absolutely been received,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Her video made no mention of her \u201cLove Island\u201d partner, Nic Vansteenberghe. He remained in the villa single when Ortega left, ultimately recoupling with fellow islander Orlandria Carthen in the same episode. The couple is still in competition as of Tuesday\u2019s episode.",
      "Ortega said she was unaware she was using a racial slur until a follower pointed it out after she posted an Instagram story in 2024 that used the term. It was one of the posts that resurfaced during her time in the villa.",
      "At this point, Ortega said \u201cthe word was immediately removed from my vocabulary.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know that moving forward, my actions and how I decide to live my life from here on out is gonna speak louder than any apology ever could,\u201d Ortega said.",
      "Ortega\u2019s departure from the villa followed Yulissa Escobar, who left the villa last month in the second episode after clips of her using racist language resurfaced online. Her departure was also not explained in the show.",
      "A spokesperson for the show declined to comment Monday.",
      "Escobar, who initially issued an apology on her Instagram story shortly after she departed the villa, took to TikTok a day after Ortega left to ask viewers to stop cyberbullying contestants.",
      "\u201cI know what I said was wrong. I know what Cierra said was wrong, and I know it hurt communities,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cAll I ask you guys is instead of threatening her and her family, try to educate us, her, me.\u201d",
      "Escobar said she was \u201chonestly scared to come home,\u201d when she first got her phone back after exiting the villa and saw the messages she had received.",
      "\u201cI was like, is something going to happen to me? Like, is somebody going to do something to me? Because it was just a lot to take in and even my family was worried,\u201d Escobar said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to take that when you\u2019re getting all these threats online.\u201d",
      "The show, which strips contestants of their phones or access to the outside world, has previously asked fans to avoid cyberbullying contestants. Host Ariana Madix called for fans to stop doxxing and harassing the show\u2019s stars in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d is an American spin-off of the original U.K. series and is airing its seventh season. The show airs daily except Wednesdays and brings young singles together in a remote villa in Fiji to explore connections with the ultimate goal of finding love.",
      "Couples undergo challenges and are encouraged test their romantic connections as new contestants are introduced. Islanders are routinely \u201cdumped\u201d from the villa throughout the series as stronger couples form. Sunday's finale will culminate with one couple who receives the most public votes being awarded $100,000.",

      "Afrobeats megastar Burna Boy is releasing his new album, \u201cNo Sign of Weakness,\u201d on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- While classmates dreamed of becoming teachers, doctors and professional athletes, Burna Boy was clear on his future aspirations.",
      "\u201cThey would hand out the papers and the question would be, \u2018What you wanna be?\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019d write \u2018rock star,\u2019\u201d said the Afrobeats giant. \u201cOne of my teachers asked me, \u2018What do rock stars do?\u2019 I didn\u2019t really know what to say.\u201d",
      "These days, the Grammy winner\u2019s music talks for him. Fresh off becoming the first African artist to sell out Paris\u2019 iconic Stade de France in April, Burna Boy has been on an incredible run, and hopes it continues with his new album out Friday.",
      "\u201c\u2019No Sign of Weakness\u2019 is really like a celebration of the fact that that I\u2019m still here throughout all these years and all the trials and tribulations,\u201d explained the Nigerian artist. \u201cI decided to intentionally make sure everyone on this project could comfortably and genuinely say they\u2019re a rock star.\u201d",
      "Following 2023\u2019s Grammy-nominated \u201cI Told Them\u2026,\u201d this project includes blockbuster features, like legendary Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger, country hitmaker Shaboozey and hip-hop heavyweight Travis Scott.",
      "Writing on all 16 tracks, Burna relied on his standard successful creation process: record constantly, choose some songs from his vault that fit his decided theme, and then craft the project around them. He's already dropped \u201cBundle by Bundle,\u201d \u201cUpdate,\u201d which features an interpolation of Soul II Soul\u2019s classic \u201cBack To Life,\u201d \u201cSweet Love\u201d and \u201cTaTaTa\u201d featuring Scott.",
      "Music from Africa has exploded globally in recent years. Regions in Africa and the Middle East reached double-digit gains in music revenue last year, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In 2023, the group reported that sub-Saharan Africa was the fastest-growing music industry, with artists like Burna, Davido and Wizkid leading the way, along with Tyla, who\u2019s spread South Africa\u2019s Amapino sound.",
      "\u201cI feel blessed. I also feel great responsibility \u2026 I\u2019m blamed for everything, most especially, things I couldn\u2019t possibly be responsible for,\u201d said Burna, alluding to demands in Nigeria. \u201cI don\u2019t vote, and I\u2019ve never done it. But now, it\u2019s to the point where even that: if I don\u2019t vote, because I don\u2019t say I\u2019ll vote for this person or vote for that person, it\u2019s a problem.\u201d",
      "But that weight of responsibility isn\u2019t felt on his eighth studio album. \u201cDem Dey,\u201d a tongue-in-cheek bop referencing his gossipy social media scandal with a Nigerian influencer which amused fans, is sure to crowd dance floors, while he and Jagger formed a dynamic duo on the Afrobeat-rock hybrid \u201cEmpty Chairs.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how I see the future of our music \u2026 music that\u2019s supposed to last, music that you can perform forever,\u201d said Burna, who collaborated with the 81-year-old by trading ideas through WhatsApp after being connected by supermodel Naomi Campbell. \u201cThat\u2019s where I want to be when I\u2019m that age.\u201d",
      "For his country-infused \u201cChange Your Mind\u201d with Shaboozey, the pair plead for second chances after souring relationships.",
      "\u201cHere\u2019s an Igbo boy from the eastern part of Nigeria who comes to America as a young guy,\u201d said Burna of the \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d singer. \u201cHe\u2019s flourishing in the country world. If I\u2019m not proud of that, then I don\u2019t think I can be proud of anything in life.\u201d",
      "The Afrobeats superstar, currently featured on the soundtrack for the blockbuster \u201cF1\" movie starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, hopes the genre continues to thrive and not become a fad. But while the female artists are united, the top men have experienced friction in the past.",
      "\u201cWe need to figure how to make our diversities into an advantage instead of a disadvantage, and that goes across \u2014 not just for Nigeria,\" said Burna, whose grandfather managed Afrobeat icon Fela Kuti. \"It goes for everything Black and African, because the only thing we always lack is strong organization.\u201d",
      "While some artists have expressed ideas on unification, Burna Boy is cautious.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about uniting ... We\u2019re talking about people who actually can help matters,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discuss with people that it\u2019s just going to end up a discussion, and there\u2019s not going to be any action.\u201d",
      "For the moment, he\u2019s pressing forward. The \u201cLast Last\u201d artist launched his world tour this week with North American dates beginning in November. It features a circular stage, providing fans an equally enjoyable musical experience \u2014 although he\u2019s certain he\u2019ll enjoy it more.",
      "\u201cThis is going to sound selfish as hell \u2014 but I definitely have more fun than everybody \u2026 when I die, I want to go to a stage in Heaven,\u201d said Burna. \u201cEvery time I watch myself perform, I see a big smile on my face that I never see anywhere else.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a pretty constant results-and-ranking rise since we\u2019ve been together,\u201d Fritz said. \"I think I would have to say she's been a big help to me just kind of keeping me focused, having someone who cares and just pushes you to just do better and do the right things, be healthier.",

      "It's the first time Fritz has reached the last four at Wimbledon. He's won two grass-court titles this season \u2014 Stuttgart and Eastbourne \u2014 and was happy he wouldn't be facing Alcaraz on clay, which would be \u201can absolute nightmare.\u201d",

      "Chanel has marked 110 years of its haute couture by recreating its atelier inside the freshly restored Grand Palais for Paris Couture Week",
      "PARIS -- Only Chanel would call its legendary Rue Cambon salon \u201ctoo small\u201d \u2014 then rebuild it, supersized, in a palace.",
      "On Tuesday, as the house marked 110 years of its haute couture \u2014 a century and more of Coco Chanel\u2019s revolution in how women dress \u2014 it blew up its atelier as a giant set inside the freshly restored Grand Palais, turning intimacy into spectacle for a nature-drenched show at Paris Couture Week.",
      "Chanel, whose founder banished corsets and reimagined luxury as liberation, showed just how far that legacy stretches: from the tiny salons of 1915 to its modern colossus.",
      "It was a flex only a handful of luxury giants could pull off \u2014 and perhaps, as one front-row guest suggested, a dazzling distraction as the fashion world counts down to the debut of Chanel's new designer Matthieu Blazy.",
      "Pen\u00e9lope Cruz, Naomi Campbell and the house\u2019s tightest VIP circle scaled gilded steps, sweating past marble and gold, to enter the reconstructed atelier. The set by Willo Perron was classic Chanel: intimate yet monumental, old world yet futuristic.",
      "\u201cIt just felt special,\u201d Campbell said, \u201clike stepping into a memory and something completely new. There\u2019s warmth, intimacy, nostalgia. Chanel can recreate anything, and it works.\"",
      "More drama unfolded on the runway. This was couture as nature fantasy, filtered through the Chanel prism. Menswear tailoring added swing to sculpted jackets and coatdresses, while mohair suits in deep greens and plums channeled autumn\u2019s hush. Boucl\u00e9 tweeds mimicked sheepskin; feathers and tweed created illusionary faux fur.",
      "Gold-sprayed wheat ears \u2014 the house symbol of abundance \u2014 were everywhere: stitched into flounces, embroidered on necklines, set on every guest\u2019s seat. The theme may have been country, but make no mistake: This was as close as Chanel gets to \u201croughing it.\u201d",
      "Technique dazzled at every turn: jewel-buttons, embroidered florals and a finale of lam\u00e9 so luminous it mimicked sunlight on harvest fields. The studio team, holding the fort after Virginie Viard\u2019s abrupt and unceremonious exit last year, anchored the show in classic codes but played with wit and lightness.",
      "That obsessive handwork matters \u2014 not just for tradition, but for business. Chanel is fashion\u2019s juggernaut: Privately held, the brand reported $18.7\u202fbillion in revenue for 2024, cementing its status as one of the world\u2019s most powerful luxury houses. Couture may be the crown, but its influence drives global sales in fragrance, bags and jewelry, making it the envy of rivals.",
      "Change is always looming at Chanel. For more than 30 years, Karl Lagerfeld transformed the brand from Parisian legend to pop phenomenon, staging ever-grander spectacles at the Grand Palais. After his death in 2019, Viard, his longtime deputy, guided Chanel into a softer, more discreet era.",
      "Now the industry is holding its breath for Blazy, a Belgian talent with stints at Margiela, Celine and most recently Bottega Veneta, where he won fans for his blend of innovation and reverence for craft.",
      "Campbell said of Blazy, whom she knows personally: \u201cHe\u2019s focused, open-minded \u2014 he\u2019ll bring something special.\u201d",
      "Tuesday\u2019s show unfolded inside the Grand Palais' newly restored Salon d\u2019Honneur, its gold and stone revealed after a 600-million-euro, multi-year restoration co-funded by Chanel. It\u2019s more than a venue; it\u2019s an advertisement of the house\u2019s power and commitment to Parisian heritage.",

      "Oprah Winfrey has selected Bruce Holsinger's novel \"Culpability\" as her latest book club pick",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oprah Winfrey has chosen a novel with a timely theme for her latest book club pick. Bruce Holsinger's \u201cCulpability\u201d is a family drama that probes the morals and ethics of AI.",
      "\u201cI appreciated the prescience of this story,\u201d Winfrey said in a statement Tuesday, the day of the novel's publication. \u201cIt\u2019s where we are right now in our appreciation and dilemmas surrounding Artificial Intelligence, centered around an American family we can relate to. I was riveted until the very last shocking sentence!\u201d",
      "Holsinger, a professor of English at the University of Virginia, is the author of four previous novels and several works of nonfiction. He said in a statement that he had admired Winfrey's book club since its founding in 1996.",
      "\u201cOprah Winfrey started her book club the same year I finished graduate school,\u201d Holsinger said. \u201cFor nearly 30 years, as I\u2019ve taught great books to college students in the classroom and the lecture hall, she has shared great books with the world. Her phone call was like a thunderbolt, and I\u2019ll never forget it. I am deeply honored and profoundly grateful that she found \u2018Culpability\u2019 worthy of her time, praise, and recognition.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's announcement continues Winfrey's book club partnership with Starbucks. Her interview with Holsinger, held recently at a Starbucks in Seattle, can be seen on Winfrey's YouTube channel or through other podcast outlets.",

      "GENEVA -- A Swiss village has cashed in on a pay-for-entry turnstile used by avid tourists who flock each day to a lakeside dock featured in the hit South Korean Netflix series \u201cCrash Landing On You,\u201d often to snap souvenir photos.",
      "Local leaders in Iseltwald and tourism officials insist the village's 406 inhabitants aren\u2019t getting rich off the influx of visitors, who pay 5 Swiss francs ($6.30) to access the dock. In 2024, entries brought in nearly 245,000 francs ($307,000), while a one-franc public pay toilet collected about 58,000 francs more, said village clerk Gabriela Blatter.",
      "Proceeds have gone mostly to garbage disposal, restroom cleaning, additional work hours and custodial staff hires, she said.",
      "Titia Weiland, manager of the B\u00f6nigen-Iseltwald Tourism agency, said the funds go right back to village upkeep: \u201cIt\u2019s not correct to read it as \u2018the community gets rich\u2019,\u201d alluding to some comments along those lines in the media and online.",
      "The village, situated along a small peninsula that juts out into Lake Brienz, features majestic views of Alpine peaks over the water.",
      "An episode in early 2020 of the cross-border Korean love story spotlighted the dock as a romantic getaway. That sparked online hype among fans of the series across Asia and beyond, which hasn\u2019t let up, fueling the rush of tourism to Iseltwald.",
      "The continued influx has exposed growing pains for the Swiss village, like those faced by other tourist hotspots that get too much of a good thing.",
      "Part of the problem is infrastructure: Iseltwald has three hotels and four restaurants, not enough for about 1,000 visitors who arrive by tour bus, public bus and car each day on average, according to Blatter. The village is revamping a parking lot to help cope with the strain, and the only village store now operates 7 days a week. Previously, it was open Monday to Friday.",
      "\u201cThere were always tourists in Iseltwald. We are happy with them. The problem is that the tourists don\u2019t understand what\u2019s private and what\u2019s public,\" Blatter said, adding that some traipse through private yards and gardens. \u201cThey go everywhere.\u201d",
      "For months, fans of the series could visit the dock for free until the turnstile was put up in 2023 to help offset costs incurred by the local government.",
      "Not long ago, Weiland said, \u201cwe were wishing for more tourists in Iseltwald: In some ways, we are thankful ... but it can be extreme.\u201d Villagers who hosted the crews for on-site filming at the dock had no idea the series would become such a runaway success, she said.",
      "The village has a website devoted to the \u201cfilming location\" of the series that lists transportation options and entreats visitors to respect the dock, refrain from littering, and consider the \u201cquiet atmosphere of this authentic Swiss village\u201d by keeping noise down and avoiding private property.",
      "\u201cEnjoy your stay in beautiful Iseltwald and take with you memories to your home country!\u201d the site says.",

      "South Africa has played a historic, global role in scientific research, from COVID-19 vaccines to HIV",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- Just a week had remained before scientists in South Africa were to begin clinical trials of an HIV vaccine, and hopes were high for another step toward limiting one of history's deadliest pandemics. Then the email arrived.",
      "Stop all work, it said. The United States under the Trump administration was withdrawing all its funding.",
      "The news devastated the researchers, who live and work in a region where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world. Their research project, called BRILLIANT, was meant to be the latest to draw on the region's genetic diversity and deep expertise in the hope of benefiting people everywhere.",
      "But the $46 million from the U.S. for the project was disappearing, part of the dismantling of foreign aid by the world's biggest donor earlier this year as President Donald Trump announced a focus on priorities at home.",
      "South Africa has been hit especially hard because of Trump's baseless claims about the targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority. The country had been receiving about $400 million a year via USAID and the HIV-focused PEPFAR.",
      "Now that's gone.",
      "Glenda Grey, who heads the Brilliant program, said the African continent has been vital to the development of HIV medication, and the U.S. cuts threaten its capability to do such work in the future.",
      "Significant advances have included clinical trials for lenacapavir, the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, recently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One study to show its efficacy involved young South Africans.",
      "\u201cWe do the trials better, faster and cheaper than anywhere else in the world, and so without South Africa as part of these programs, the world, in my opinion, is much poorer,\u201d Gray said.",
      "She noted that during the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa played a crucial role by testing the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines, and South African scientists' genomic surveillance led to the identification of an important variant.",
      "A team of researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand has been part of the unit developing the HIV vaccines for the trials.",
      "Inside the Wits laboratory, technician Nozipho Mlotshwa was among the young people in white gowns working on samples, but she may soon be out of a job.",
      "Her position is grant-funded. She uses her salary to support her family and fund her studies in a country where youth unemployment hovers around 46%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and devastating, honestly,\" she said of the U.S. cuts and overall uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll also miss out collaborating with other scientists across the continent.\u201d",
      "Professor Abdullah Ely leads the team of researchers. He said the work had promising results indicating that the vaccines were producing an immune response.",
      "But now that momentum, he said, has \u201call kind of had to come to a halt.\u201d",
      "The BRILLIANT program is scrambling to find money to save the project. The purchase of key equipment has stopped. South Africa's health department says about 100 researchers for that program and others related to HIV have been laid off. Funding for postdoctoral students involved in experiments for the projects is at risk.",
      "South Africa's government has estimated that universities and science councils could lose about $107 million in U.S. research funding over the next five years due to the aid cuts, which affect not only work on HIV but also tuberculosis \u2014 another disease with a high number of cases in the country.",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said it will be very difficult to find funding to replace the U.S. support.",
      "And now the number of HIV infections will grow. Medication is more difficult to obtain. At least 8,000 health workers in South Africa's HIV program have already been laid off, the government has said. Also gone are the data collectors who tracked patients and their care, as well as HIV counselors who could reach vulnerable patients in rural communities.",
      "For researchers, Universities South Africa, an umbrella body, has applied to the national treasury for over $110 million for projects at some of the largest schools.",
      "During a visit to South Africa in June, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima was well aware of the stakes, and the lives at risk, as research and health care struggle in South Africa and across Africa at large.",
      "Other countries that were highly dependent on U.S. funding including Zambia, Nigeria, Burundi and Ivory Coast are already increasing their own resources, she said.",

      "APEX, N.C. -- North Carolina\u2019s first standalone children\u2019s hospital will be built in a bedroom community near the state capital, the project\u2019s health systems announced Thursday, creating a campus estimated to bring 8,000 jobs to the area.",
      "UNC Health and Duke Health announced in January an agreement to jointly build the proposed 500-bed pediatric hospital and linked facilities in the state\u2019s Research Triangle region, which includes Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill.",
      "At that time, the specific location wasn't finalized. But leaders of the health systems said Thursday that the \u201cNorth Carolina Children's\u201d project will be constructed about 20 miles (32.19 kilometers) southwest of downtown Raleigh in the Wake County town of Apex. Apex has a population of 77,000, which is already surging in population thanks to the region's strong technology economy.",
      "More than 15 potential sites in several counties were considered, Duke Health CEO Dr. Craig Albanese said at an Apex news conference.",
      "The 230-acre (93.1-hectare) campus, located near a regional transportation interchange, will also include a children\u2019s outpatient care center, over 100 behavioral health beds and a research and education center operated by Duke University and University of North Carolina medical schools.",
      "The campus is poised to be integrated into a long-discussed mixed-use development location called Veridea that will include thousands of new homes, retail, dining, office and research space, as well as a new Wake Technical Community College campus.",
      "\u201cThis campus will create a brighter, healthier future for generations of children and adolescents across North Carolina and the Southeast, and we\u2019re thrilled to have Apex as our home and partner,\" UNC Heatlh CEO Dr. Wesley Burks said in a news release.",
      "A groundbreaking for the hospital campus is now expected in 2027, with construction anticipated to take six years. North Carolina Children\u2019s Health also issued on Thursday a request for information from potential design and construction contractors for the project.",
      "There are children\u2019s hospitals already in North Carolina, including those operated by the University of North Carolina and Duke University health systems that are attached to their main campuses in the Triangle.",
      "The Apex location \u201cwill ensure that the Triangle remains a hub and a destination for the best pediatric scientists, teachers and clinicians \u2014 convenient to both medical school campuses,\u201d said Dr. Mary Klotman, dean of the Duke University medical school and a Duke Health executive.",
      "The new children's hospital agreed to acquire a portion of the Veridea land, which is owned by a business partnership between the North Carolina state retirement system and the land developers, according to the State Treasurer's Office, which administers the system.",
      "State Treasurer Brad Briner said at the news conference that the land sale is a win for everyone involved, including government retirees and the pension system, \"making a modest profit and unlocking more value in the land that is adjacent.\u201d",
      "\u201cAbove all, it's a win for the 11 million North Carolinians who deserve world-class pediatric care right here at home,\u201d he added.",
      "The health systems have said the hospital campus project could cost from $2 billion to $3 billion, with a massive private fundraising effort ahead.",
      "The project has already received $320 million from state legislators. The next state budget, still being negotiated by House and Senate Republicans that ultimately would head to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein's desk, also could contain more project funds.",
      "Stein said in an interview Thursday that beyond the economic opportunity the project will spark, \u201cI\u2019m really excited about what the children\u2019s hospital means for children of North Carolina who are sick and in need of the best, most sophisticated, advanced medical interventions to live long, healthy lives.\u201d",

      "BOBO-DIOULASSO, Burkina Faso -- Isaka Diallo was playing with friends when a stone struck his left eye. For two weeks, his parents searched hospitals in western Burkina Faso for an eye doctor. The village clinic only prescribed painkillers. Other health workers did not know what to do.",
      "When they eventually found Dr. Claudette Yam\u00e9ogo, Burkina Faso\u2019s only pediatric ophthalmologist, the injury had become too difficult to treat.",
      "\u201cThe trauma has become severe,\u201d Yam\u00e9ogo said of Diallo\u2019s condition as she attended to him recently at the Sanou Sourou University Hospital in the city of Bobo-Dioulasso. \u201cCases like (Diallo\u2019s) must be treated within the first six hours, but I\u2019m seeing him two weeks later, and it\u2019s already too late.\u201d",
      "It is a common problem in the country of about 23 million people, which has just 70 ophthalmologists.",
      "Yam\u00e9ogo , who started her practice late last year, said the work is daunting and often requires her to visit \u2014 at no cost \u2014 families who cannot afford care or cannot make their way to the hospital where she works.",
      "While there is limited data available on eye defects in children in Burkina Faso or in Africa at large, an estimated 450 million children globally have a sight problem that needs treatment, according to the International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness.",
      "Late intervention can significantly alter a child\u2019s future, the organization said, with many such cases in less developed countries.",
      "In Burkina Faso, an estimated 70% of the population lives in rural areas. And yet ophthalmologists are concentrated in the capital, Ouagadougou, and other main cities, making them unreachable for many.",
      "While more than 2,000 ophthalmology procedures were performed in Burkina Faso\u2019s western Hauts-Bassins region in 2024, only 52 of those were carried out in its more rural areas, according to the Ministry of Health. Most procedures were done in the area of Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso\u2019s second city.",

      "In a further challenge to accessing care, Diallo\u2019s family is among the 2 million people displaced by violence as extremist groups seize parts of the country.",
      "To visit Yam\u00e9ogo\u2019s hospital from the village where they are sheltering, they had to travel about 40 kilometers (21 miles) on a motorcycle to Bobo-Dioulasso, spending 7,500 francs ($13) on transport, a high price for a small-scale farming family.",
      "At least 70% of the trauma cases in children treated at the hospital come from rural areas where the risk of exposure \u2014 from conflict or from play \u2014 is higher, Yam\u00e9ogo said.",
      "Examining and treating a child is a delicate practice that requires a lot of time, something many families can\u2019t afford. Many must return home to earn money for the treatment.",
      "As she treated Diallo, Yam\u00e9ogo noticed that the boy associated a drawing of an apple with a pepper, making her wonder: Is it that he can\u2019t see it, or that he doesn\u2019t know what an apple is? The fruit doesn't grow in the region where he lives.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no fixed time for examining children,\u201d she said. \u201cYou need a lot of patience.\u201d",

      "\u201cA child\u2019s eye is not the same as that of an adult, which is why we need specialists to treat problems early so the child can develop properly,\u201d Diallo said.",
      "He cited retinoblastoma, a retinal cancer mostly affecting young children, and congenital cataracts, eye diseases that can be cured if diagnosed early. Pediatricians won\u2019t necessarily detect them.",
      "During another consultation, Yam\u00e9ogo told the family of 5-year-old Fatao Traor\u00e9 that he would need cornea surgery as a result of an injury sustained while playing with a stick.",

      "The CDC identified 22 outbreaks in 2019, the largest being two separate clusters in New York \u2014 412 in New York state and 702 in New York City. These were linked because as measles was spreading through close-knit Orthodox Jewish communities, the CDC said.",
      "It's a similar situation in North America this year, where the Canada, Mexico and Texas outbreaks stem from large Mennonite communities in the regions. Mennonite churches do not formally discourage vaccination, though more conservative Mennonite communities historically have low vaccination rates and a distrust of government.",
      "A recent study found childhood vaccination rates against measles fell after the COVID-19 pandemic in nearly 80% of the more than 2,000 U.S. counties with available data, including in states that are battling outbreaks this year.",
      "Only 92.7% of kindergarteners in the U.S. had the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine in the 2023-2024 school year, below the 95% needed to prevent outbreaks. In Gaines County, Texas, the epicenter of the Texas outbreak, only 82% of kindergarteners were up-to-date with MMR vaccines.",
      "State and federal leaders have for years kept funding stagnant for local public health departments' vaccination programs that are tasked with reversing the trend.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing with measles is a little bit of a \u2018canary in a coal mine,'\" said Lauren Gardner, leader of Johns Hopkins University's independent measles and COVID tracking databases. \"It\u2019s indicative of a problem that we know exists with vaccination attitudes in this county and just, I think, likely to get worse.\u201d",

      "The U.S. Senate's health committee on Wednesday approved Susan Monarez to be President Donald Trump\u2019s director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, taking her one step closer to confirmation.",
      "The committee voted 12-11 for advancing her nomination to the full Senate. The vote went along party lines, with Democrats in opposition.",
      "Monarez, 50, is poised to become the first CDC director to pass through Senate confirmation following a 2023 law. She was named acting director in January and then tapped as the nominee in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon.",
      "She holds a doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. Prior to the CDC, Monarez was largely known for her government roles in health technology and biosecurity.",

      "The CDC has been hit by widespread staff cuts, resignations of key officials and heated controversy over longstanding CDC vaccine policies upended by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Last month, Monarez told senators that she values vaccines, public health interventions and rigorous scientific evidence, but she largely dodged questions about whether those positions put her at odds with Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic who has criticized and sought to dismantle some of the agency\u2019s previous protocols and decisions.",

    "story": [
      "Scientists have linked last week\u2019s European heat wave to human-caused climate change and estimate that climate change was responsible for 1,500 deaths",
      "WASHINGTON -- Human-caused climate change is responsible for killing about 1,500 people in last week's European heat wave, a first-of-its-kind rapid study found.",
      "Those 1,500 people \u201chave only died because of climate change, so they would not have died if it would not have been for our burning of oil, coal and gas in the last century,\u201d said study co-author Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College in London.",
      "Scientists at Imperial and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used peer-reviewed techniques to calculate that about 2,300 people in 12 cities likely died from the heat in last week's bout of high temperatures, with nearly two-thirds of them dying because of the extra degrees that climate change added to the natural summer warmth.",
      "Past rapid attribution studies have not gone beyond evaluating climate change's role in meteorological effects such as extra heat, flooding or drought. This study goes a step further in directly connecting coal, oil and natural gas use to people dying.",
      "\u201cHeat waves are silent killers and their health impact is very hard to measure,\u2033 said co-author Gary Konstantinoudis, a biostatistician at Imperial College. \u201dPeople do not understand the actual mortality toll of heat waves and this is because (doctors, hospitals and governments) do not report heat as an underlying cause of death\u201d and instead attribute it to heart or lung or other organ problems.",
      "Of the 1,500 deaths attributed to climate change, the study found more than 1,100 were people 75 or older.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s summer, so it\u2019s sometimes hot,\" study lead author Ben Clarke of Imperial College said in a Tuesday news conference. \u201dThe influence of climate change has pushed it up by several degrees and what that does is it brings certain groups of people more into dangerous territory and that\u2019s what\u2019s important. That\u2019s what we really want to highlight here. For some people it\u2019s still warm fine weather but for now a huge sector of the population it's more dangerous.\"",
      "Researchers looked at June 23 to July 2 in London; Paris; Frankfurt, Germany; Budapest, Hungary; Zagreb, Croatia; Athens, Greece; Barcelona, Spain; Madrid; Lisbon, Portugal; Rome; Milan and Sassari, Italy. They found that except in Lisbon, the extra warmth from greenhouse gases added 2 to 4 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) to what would have been a more natural heat wave. London got the most at nearly 4 degrees (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Climate change only added about a degree to Lisbon's peak temperature, the study calculated, mostly because of the Atlantic Ocean's moderating effect, Otto said.",
      "That extra climate-change-caused heat added the most extra deaths in Milan, Barcelona and Paris and the least in Sassari, Frankfort and Lisbon, the study found. The 1,500 figure is the middle of the range of overall climate-related death estimates that go from about 1,250 to around 1,700.",
      "Wednesday's study is not yet peer-reviewed. It is an extension of work done by an international team of scientists who do rapid attribution studies to search for global warming\u2019s fingerprints in the growing number of extreme weather events worldwide, and combine that with long-established epidemiological research that examines death trends that differ from what's considered normal.",
      "Researchers compared what the thermometers read last week to what computer simulations say would have happened in a world without planet-warming greenhouse gases from fossil fuel use. Health researchers then compared estimates \u2014 there are no solid figures yet \u2014 for heat deaths in what just happened to what heat deaths would be expected for each city without those extra degrees of warmth.",
      "There are long-established formulas that calculate excess deaths differing from normal based on location, demographics, temperatures and other factors and those are used, Otto and Konstantinoudis said. And health researchers take into account many variables like smoking and chronic diseases, so it's comparing similar people except for temperature so they know that's what's to blame, Konstantinoudis said.",
      "Studies in 2021 generally linked excess heat deaths to human-caused climate change and carbon emissions, but not specific events like last week's hot spell. A 2023 study in Nature Medicine estimated that since 2015, for every degree Celsius the temperature rises in Europe, there's an extra 18,547 summer heat deaths.",
      "Studies like Wednesday's are \u201cending the guessing game on the health harms from continued burning of fossil fuels,\u201d said Dr. Jonathan Patz, director of the Center for Health, Energy and Environmental Research at the University of Wisconsin. He was not part of the research but said it \u201ccombined the most up-to-date climate and health methods and found that every fraction of a degree of warming matters regarding extreme heat waves.\u201d",
      "Dr. Courtney Howard, a Canadian emergency room physician and chair of the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said, \u201cStudies like this help us see that reducing fossil fuel use is health care.\u201d",

      "Phay and her partner have two daughters, and they barely make ends meet. Determined not to have more children, she went to a health worker in her village, but contraception pills, implants and condoms had run out. Phay trekked for hours on red clay roads to the nearest clinic, but they had no contraceptives either.",
      "She did not know it, but her mission was doomed from the beginning. Just weeks before, U.S. President Donald Trump abruptly suspended most foreign aid through the U.S. Agency for International Development, which paid for medications in Liberia's public clinics.",
      "Tenacious and outspoken, Phay repeated the trip four times. Then she got pregnant.",
      "\u201cI'm suffering,\u201d she said, with daughter Pauline crying in her arms. \u201cI have this little child on my back, and the other child in my stomach is suffering.\" She must continue farming throughout her pregnancy, she said, or \"I will not eat.\u201d",
      "After she got pregnant she had to wean Pauline off breastfeeding, she said, and the girl became so badly malnourished that she almost died. The U.S. cuts left no therapeutic food to give her, and she is still ill.",
      "Phay is among millions across Africa who have seen their lives upended after the U.S. aid cuts. In Liberia, the American support made up almost 2.6% of the gross national income, the highest percentage anywhere in the world, according to the Center for Global Development.",
      "\u201cThe impact of USAID in Liberia cannot be overstated,\u201d said Richlue O. Burphy, who worked for USAID projects for over a decade and manages the National Lottery, a government body. \u201cEverywhere you go, you see the USAID (signs). And almost all the government institutions ... had some kind of USAID partnership.\u201d",
      "The sense of betrayal runs deep in Liberia, established in the early 1800s with the aim of relocating freed slaves and free-born Black people from the United States. The political system is modeled on that of the U.S., along with its flag. Liberians often refer to the U.S. as their \u201cbig brother.\u201d",
      "Liberia was one of the first countries to receive USAID support, starting in 1961. Its officials thought they would be spared from Trump\u2019s cuts because of the countries' close relationship.",
      "Following civil wars and an Ebola epidemic, Liberia's survival has depended largely on foreign aid, mainly from the U.S. and the World Bank. Despite abundant natural wealth, six out of 10 Liberians live in poverty, according to the World Bank, and Liberia is among the world's 10 poorest nations.",
      "The aid cuts pose \u201ca serious challenge,\u201d especially for the healthcare system, Deputy Finance Minister Dehpue Y. Zuo, responsible for drafting the development budget, told The Associated Press. To make sure the system stays afloat, he said, \"we have to take a dramatic switch to see where we will be cutting funding for other areas.\u201d",
      "Liberia received an average of $527.6 million in aid annually between 2014 and 2023, according to the finance ministry. This year, Liberia was supposed to receive $443 million, but the total estimated impact of the cuts is $290 million \u2014 essentially what hadn't been disbursed yet.",
      "USAID funding built schools and health clinics, provided training for teachers and doctors and gave scholarships for study in the U.S. It supported small-scale farmers and paid for school meals.",
      "But most of the U.S. funding went to Liberia's health system, making up 48% of its budget. It funded malaria control, maternal health programs, HIV/AIDS treatment and community health programs. It financed hundreds of health projects run by aid groups.",
      "Now in Bong county, where Phay lives, medicine shelves in health clinics are almost empty. The USAID-funded ambulance cannot function because there is no money for fuel. Hospitals are running out of hand sanitizer and gloves. Training for medical staff has stopped, and community health workers have not been paid in months.",
      "Moses K. Banyan, head of the nearby CB Dunbar Hospital, described the U.S. cuts as \u201cbeyond a shock.\u201d He worried about the future, especially now that Bong county has begun to see a handful of mpox cases spread from neighboring Sierra Leone.",

      "The withdrawal of U.S. support is an opportunity for others, especially China, experts and officials said. Chinese companies have been operating Liberia\u2019s gold mines, building roads and training aid workers. Chinese beer is sold alongside local brands. Many Liberians who would have sent children to universities in the U.S. are now choosing China.",

      "In Phay's village of Sarworlor, community health worker Alice Togbah still wears her USAID vest though she hasn't been paid in months. She has no more malaria medication for children. She is running out of cough medicine and diarrhea treatment.",
      "A 4-year-old resident, Promise, got malaria a few days ago. Her mother, Grace Morris, obtained only a limited number of malaria tablets at the nearest clinic because of the U.S. cuts. Now they are finished, and the child still feels ill.",
      "\u201cChildren die from malaria here,\u201d she said. Last year, her neighbor's son died because he did not get medication on time.",

      "A German doctor has gone on trial in Berlin, accused of murdering 15 patients who were under palliative care",
      "BERLIN -- BERLIN (AP) \u2014 A German doctor went on trial in Berlin Monday, accused of murdering 15 of his patients who were under palliative care.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office brought charges against the 40-year-old doctor \u201cfor 15 counts of murder with malice aforethought and other base motives\u201d before a Berlin state court. The prosecutor\u2019s office is seeking not only a conviction and a finding of particularly serious guilt, but also a lifetime ban on practicing medicine and subsequent preventive detention.",
      "Murder charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison. If a court establishes that a suspect bears particularly severe guilt, that means he wouldn\u2019t be eligible for release after 15 years as is usually the case in Germany.",
      "Parallel to the trial, the prosecutor\u2019s office is investigating dozens of other suspected cases in separate proceedings.",
      "The man, who has only been identified as Johannes M. in line with Germany privacy rules, is also accused of trying to cover up evidence of the murders by starting fires in the victims' homes. He has been in custody since Aug. 6.",
      "The doctor was part of a nursing service\u2019s end-of-life care team in the German capital and was initially suspected in the deaths of just four patients. That number has crept higher since last summer, and prosecutors are now accusing him of the deaths of 15 people between Sept. 22, 2021, and July 24 last year.",
      "The victims\u2019 ages ranged from 25 to 94. Most died in their own homes.",
      "The doctor allegedly administered an anesthetic and a muscle relaxer to the patients without their knowledge or consent. The drug cocktail then allegedly paralyzed the respiratory muscles. Respiratory arrest and death followed within minutes, prosecutors said.",
      "The doctor did not agree to an interview with a psychiatric expert ahead of the trial, German news agency dpa reported. The expert will therefore observe the defendant\u2019s behavior in court and hear statements from witnesses in order to give an assessment of the man\u2019s personality and culpability.",
      "So far, it is unclear what the palliative care physician\u2019s motive might have been, dpa reported. The victims named in the indictment were all seriously ill, but their deaths were not imminent.",
      "The defendant will not make a statement to the court for the time being, his defense lawyer Christoph Stoll said, according to dpa.",
      "The court has initially scheduled 35 trial dates for the proceedings until January 28, 2026. According to the court, 13 relatives of the deceased are represented as co-plaintiffs. There are several witnesses for each case, and around 150 people in total could be heard in court, dpa reported.",
      "An investigation into further suspected deaths is continuing.",
      "A specially established investigation team in the homicide department of the Berlin State Criminal Police Office and the Berlin public prosecutor\u2019s office investigated a total of 395 cases. In 95 of these cases, initial suspicion was confirmed and preliminary proceedings were initiated. In five cases, the initial suspicion was not substantiated.",
      "In 75 cases, investigations are still ongoing in separate proceedings. Five exhumations are still planned for this separate procedure, prosecutors said.",
      "In 2019, a German nurse who murdered 87 patients by deliberately bringing about cardiac arrests was given a life sentence.",
      "Earlier this month, German investigators in the northern town of Itzehoe said they were examining the case of a doctor who has been suspected of killing several patients.",

      "HANOI, Vietnam -- Vietnam will ban fossil-fuel motorcycles and mopeds in the heart of the capital, Hanoi, starting July 2026, as part of a nationwide effort to curb air pollution, state media reported.",
      "The directive issued by Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh applies to the area inside and along the main ring road that encircles the center of Hanoi. The local government has been tasked with phasing out the two-wheelers by the deadline.",
      "Like the rest of Vietnam, motorcycles are the main mode of transport for most of Hanoi\u2019s 8 million residents. The city has nearly 7 million motorcycles and just over a million cars. But as incomes rise and more people switch to private vehicles, air pollution from traffic has become a growing concern. Hanoi is often enveloped in thick smog, ranking among the most polluted cities worldwide.",
      "Vietnam also wants to switch from fossil-fuel to electric vehicles to cut pollution and tackle climate change. Local EV maker VinFast is leading the shift by holding nearly a fifth of the market share, according to the European Chamber of Commerce. But it still has only a small share of the two-wheeler market.",
      "But many are concerned about the unclear plan for phasing out the vehicles.",
      "Nguyen Van Hung, 62, has spent three decades driving a motorcycle taxi in Hanoi, now working with Grab, a ride-hailing app widely used across Southeast Asia. He worries the ban will hit the working class hardest. \u201cIt will affect people who rely on motorbikes to earn a living,\u201d he said, pointing to delivery drivers, commuters and ride-hailing services. \u201cHow can people just discard their vehicles?\u201d",
      "Others said that the timeline was unrealistic. Hoang Duy Dung, 32, an office clerk who works in the city center, said he supports cleaner air but believes it is too soon. \u201cWe need better public transport and more support before such a big change.\u201d",
      "Central Hanoi is home to much of the city\u2019s business activity, including offices, government buildings and commercial hubs.",
      "A second phase, set to begin in January 2028, will expand the ban to a wider area and include all fossil-fuel two-wheelers, while also restricting some gasoline-powered cars.",
      "Other measures include upgrading waste-treatment plants, using digital tools to monitor pollution and introducing stricter penalties for violators. Whistleblowers could be rewarded for reporting environmental breaches.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. had renounced his Maltese citizenship and disclosed it to Filipino authorities before taking office, the Defense Department said Monday.",
      "Philippine law generally disqualifies candidates for high public office who have dual citizenship, especially those with foreign citizenship acquired through naturalization, unless they renounce their foreign citizenship.",
      "Teodoro, who was appointed defense chief by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in 2023, is one of the most vocal critics of China\u2019s aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea and elsewhere in Asia. He has led efforts by the Philippines to deepen its treaty alliance with the United States and build new security ties with other countries to deter China.",
      "The Manila Times reported Teodoro had acquired a Maltese passport in 2016 with a validity of 10 years. The Defense Department said, however, Teodoro\u2019s Maltese passport \u201cwas surrendered and renounced\u201d before he filed his certificate of candidacy for a Senate seat in 2021. Teodoro lost that senatorial bid.",
      "A Philippine congressional committee on appointments was also notified that Teodoro had renounced his Maltese passport and citizenship before it confirmed his appointment as defense secretary, the defense department said and suggested that critics were trying to undermine his image.",
      "\u201cThe motive of this rumor is clear and known to Sec. Teodoro,\u201d the defense department said without elaborating. \u201cThe timing of the article adds to this motive.\u201d",
      "The Department of National Defense did not provide details of Teodoro\u2019s acquisition of his passport from Malta, which belongs to the 27-nation European Union. Malta, through its so-called golden passport scheme, has allowed foreigners to become citizens through financial investment.",
      "In April, the European Court of Justice ordered Malta to close its \u201cgolden passport\u201d program, ruling that citizenship in EU countries cannot be sold. Programs that allow wealthy people to buy citizenship were once widespread in Europe, but they\u2019ve been rolled back out of concern they facilitate transnational crime and sanctions evasion.",

      "France is celebrating its biggest holiday Monday with 7,000 people marching, on horseback or riding armored vehicles along the cobblestones of the Champs-Elysees, the most iconic avenue in Paris. And there are plans for partying and pageantry around the country.",
      "Parisians stormed the Bastille fortress and prison on July 14, 1789, a spark for the French Revolution that overthrew the monarchy. In the ensuing two centuries, France saw Napoleon\u2019s empire rise and fall, more uprisings and two world wars before settling into today\u2019s Fifth Republic, established in 1958.",
      "Bastille Day has become a central moment for modern France, celebrating democratic freedoms and national pride, a m\u00e9lange of revolutionary spirit and military prowess.",
      "The Paris parade beneath the Arc de Triomphe so impressed visiting U.S. President Donald Trump in 2017 that it inspired him to stage his own parade this year.",
      "The spectacle begins on the ground, with French President Emmanuel Macron reviewing the troops and relighting the eternal flame beneath the Arc de Triomphe.",

      "Beyond the military spectacle in Paris are growing concerns about an uncertain world. On the eve Bastille Day, Macron announced 6.5 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in extra French military spending in the next two years because of new threats ranging from Russia to terrorism and online attacks. The French leader called for intensified efforts to protect Europe and support for Ukraine.",
      "\u2018\u2019Since 1945, our freedom has never been so threatened, and never so seriously,\u2033 Macron said. \u2019\u2019We are experiencing a return to the fact of a nuclear threat, and a proliferation of major conflicts.\u2033",

      "Trump last week teased that he would make a \u201cmajor statement\u201d on Russia on Monday.

      "Trump has long boasted of his friendly relationship with Putin and after taking office in January repeatedly said that Russia was more willing than Ukraine to reach a peace deal. At the same time, Trump accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the war and called him a \u201cdictator without elections.\u201d",

      "Syria's defense and interior ministries were deploying personnel to the area to attempt to restore order.",
      "The interior ministry in a statement called the situation a dangerous escalation that \u201ccomes in the absence of the relevant official institutions, which has led to an exacerbation of the state of chaos, the deterioration of the security situation, and the inability of the local community to contain the situation despite repeated calls for calm.\u201d",
      "Factions from the Druze minority have been suspicious of the new authorities in Damascus after former President Bashar Assad fell in a lightning rebel offensive led by Sunni Islamist insurgent groups in December. Earlier this year, Druze groups in Sweida clashed with security forces from the new government.",
      "The Druze religious sect is a minority group that began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. In Syria, they largely live in the southern Sweida province and some suburbs of Damascus, mainly in Jaramana and Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to the south.",
      "The Druze developed their own militias during the country\u2019s nearly 14-year civil war. Since Assad\u2019s fall, different Druze factions have been at odds over whether to integrate with the new government and armed forces.",

      "The multistage restoration of Copenhagen\u2019s Old Stock Exchange is taking shape 15 months after a fire destroyed more than half of the 400-year-old building",
      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Balancing on wooden boards, coppersmiths are hammering and fastening sheets of the reddish-brown metal onto the roof of Copenhagen\u2019s Old Stock Exchange.",
      "Fifteen months after a devastating fire destroyed more than half the building, a multistage effort to restore the 400-year-old landmark is beginning to take shape as workers lay a new copper roof on some of the less-damaged parts.",
      "Back in February, workers began dismantling what remained of the old green copper roof, before carpenters could replace the wooden boards beneath. Now the coppersmiths are working through the summer to remain on schedule.",
      "\u201cThe copper work, it\u2019s not sophisticated, but the way it\u2019s done is old school \u2026 we are doing it exactly as it was before,\u201d said Ren\u00e9 Hansen of Danish coppersmith Toft Kobber. He said that only about 35 people have knowledge of such old techniques in Scandinavia.",
      "Early in the morning of April 16, 2024, a fire tore through the sprawling red-brick building, largely destroying its copper roof and toppling its distinctive 56-meter (184-foot) spire in the shape of four intertwined dragon tails. Two days later, a large section of the building\u2019s outer wall collapsed inward.",
      "Construction of the exchange, a major tourist attraction in the heart of the Danish capital, started in 1615 and it first opened in 1624.",
      "The fire is believed to have started under the roof, which had been wrapped in scaffolding because of renovation work. Police said in November that nothing pointed to the blaze being the result of a criminal act.",
      "The building's owner, Denmark\u2019s Chamber of Commerce, says it plans to rebuild the landmark by 2029. It aims to reopen the damaged, but not destroyed, Stock Exchange Hall by the end of this year.",
      "\u201cOur ambition is, in December this year, to open one of the floors,\u201d said Lars Daugaard Jepsen, the head of reconstruction. \u201cThat is very, very challenging, but we will make it.\u201d",
      "Once the huge white construction tent now covering the building comes off, locals are likely to notice at least one big difference. Hansen said that, due to reduced air pollution, it could take 60 to 80 years for the new copper covering to achieve its predecessor's turquoise hue through the chemical reaction known as patination.",
      "\u201cWe are driving electric cars, a lot of people are bicycling,\u201d he said. In the past, \u201cit took about 30 to 40 years before it started to get green, and now we think it will take about 60 to 80.\u201d",
      "The dragon-tail spire \u2014 a lead-covered wooden construction \u2014 will be rebuilt too, though that is still a while away. Work to design it is due to start next month, and building work is slated to get under way in 2028. A sculptor is still being sought.",
      "Daugaard Jepsen said the building was rebuilt eight times over its 400 years. The plan now is to rebuild it as it was four centuries ago, with \u201ca more magnificent ballroom.\u201d",
      "The aim is to use the same materials that were available in the 17th century. More than 800,000 handmade red bricks have been ordered from Germany and Poland, almost 900 pine trees are being brought from Denmark and Sweden, and recycled copper comes from Finland.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the way to rebuild a building like this,\u201d said Daugaard Jepsen. \u201cIn the real way.\u201d",

      "U.S. President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the U.K. between Sept. 17 and 19 when he will be hosted by King Charles II and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Donald Trump will make an unprecedented second state visit to the U.K. between Sept. 17 and 19 when he will be hosted by King Charles II and Queen Camilla at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace said Monday.",
      "Trump, who is a big supporter of the royal family, particularly of the monarch, will be accompanied by his wife, Melania Trump during the three-day visit, the palace confirmed.",
      "No U.S. president has been invited for a second state visit. Trump previously enjoyed the pomp and pageantry of the state visit in 2019 during his first term when he was hosted by Charles' late mother, Queen Elizabeth II.",
      "The invitation for the second state visit from the king was hand-delivered by British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in February during a meeting at the White House.",
      "After reading it, Trump said it was a \u201cgreat, great honor\u201d and appeared particularly pleased by the fact he will be staying at Windsor Castle, to the west of the capital. \u201cThat\u2019s really something,\u201d he said.",
      "Precedent for second-term U.S. presidents who have already made a state visit is usually tea or lunch with the monarch at Windsor Castle, as was the case for George W. Bush and Barack Obama.",
      "State visits are ceremonial meetings between heads of state that are used to honor friendly nations and sometimes smooth relations between rivals. While the king formally issues the invitation for a state visit, he does so on the advice of the elected government.",
      "The visit is seen as part of Starmer\u2019s effort to keep Trump close and lessen the impact of some of his polices on the U.K. The relationship between the two appears amicable, and has helped the U.K. from facing the sort of hefty U.S. tariffs that other nations are seeing.",
      "But like Trump's previous visit, it's unlikely he will be welcomed by all. Last time, a day of protests saw the flying of a giant blimp depicting Trump as an angry orange baby from outside Parliament.",
      "Lawmakers from Starmer\u2019s Labour Party have also questioned whether the honor should be extended to Trump at a time that he is supporting Israel\u2019s war in Gaza and threatening the sovereignty of allies such as Canada and Greenland.",
      "Charles could also face some challenges during the visit because he is head of state of both the United Kingdom and Canada, which Trump has suggested should become the 51st U.S. state. During a speech to the Canadian parliament in May the king highlighted Canada\u2019s \u201cunique identity\u201d and \u201csovereignty,\u201d while echoing the words of the country\u2019s national anthem when he said \u201cThe True North is indeed strong and free.\u201d",
      "State visits to Britain are particularly prized by heads of state because they come with a full complement of royal pomp and circumstance, including military reviews, carriage rides and a glittering state banquet hosted by the monarch.",
      "The events normally take place in and around Buckingham Palace in central London. But like last week's state visit from French President Emmanual Macron and his wife Brigitte, the Trumps will stay at Windsor Castle. Buckingham Palace is undergoing extensive remodeling.",

      "YAOUNDE, Cameroon -- YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) \u2014 Cameroon's 92-year-old president announced Monday he will seek his eighth term in the upcoming October elections. The announcement comes after months of speculation that the aging leader would not run, setting the stage for an electoral showdown.",
      "Paul Biya, Africa\u2019s second longest serving president after Teodoro Obiang of Equatorial Guinea, is frequently sick and abroad. Last year, talk spread that he had died, prompting the government to publicly deny the rumors. Cameroon\u2019s second president since independence from France in 1960, Biya has been in power since 1982.",
      "Promising that the best is yet to come in his post on social media, Biya reiterated his determination to rule, saying, \u201cRest assured that my determination to serve you is commensurate with the serious challenges facing us.\"",
      "The more than 40 years of Biya\u2019s rule have left a lasting impact. His government has faced various challenges, including allegations of corruption and a secessionist movement in Cameroon\u2019s English-speaking provinces that has forced thousands out of school and triggered deadly clashes with security forces.",
      "\u201cPresident Biya\u2019s announcement to run again is a clear sign of Cameroon\u2019s stalled political transition. After over 40 years in power, what the country needs is renewal \u2014 not repetition. Cameroonians deserve democratic change and accountable leadership,\u201d Nkongho Felix Agbor, a human rights advocate and lawyer told The Associated Press.",
      "Cameroon has also had to deal with spillover violence by the Islamic extremist Boko Haram group, based in neighboring Nigeria.",
      "Recently, several of Biya\u2019s longtime allies defected to announce their own candidacies for president.",
      "He cruised to victory in 2018 with over 70% of the vote in an election marred by irregularities and low turnout due to ongoing separatist and jihadi violence.",
      "In a region threatened with shrinking democratic space, several other African countries also have presidents accused of using state mechanisms to prolong their stay in power. Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni recently sought nomination for a seventh term, a move that would bring him closer to five decades in power in the East African country.",

      "Every year, thousands of people line the medieval streets of Pamplona to witness the centuries-old tradition of running with bulls. Many watch from balconies and wooden barricades along the course. Millions more follow the spectacle on television.",
      "Women bull runners are rare, though Mart\u00ednez and other women taking part in the adrenaline-fueled tradition as more than mere spectators say it\u2019s growing in popularity.",

      "\u201cBut in the moment, you are all equal,\u201d Pu\u00f1al said of the run.",
      "The bulls pound along the twisting cobblestone streets after being led by six steers. Up to 4,000 runners take part in each bull run, which takes place over 846 meters (2,775 feet) and can last two to four minutes.",
      "The expert Spanish runners try to sprint just in front of the bull\u2019s horns for a few seconds while egging the animal on with a rolled newspaper. Gorings are not rare, but many more people are bruised and injured in falls and pileups with each other.",

L\u00f3pez said she grew up in the masculine world of bull fighting. She wasn\u2019t fazed by how few women take part in the event.",
      "\u201cIt's complicated, but it is pretty exciting,\u201d L\u00f3pez said.",
      "The event\u2019s reputation took a hit years ago following complaints by women about having suffered sexual harassment and abuse from revelers.",
      "In 2016, five men raped an 18-year-old woman during the festival in an infamous case that sparked an outcry across Spain. The men, who had a WhatsApp group named \u201cLa Manada,\u201d or \u201cThe Animal Pack,\u201d were imprisoned for 15 years by the Supreme Court in 2019.",
      "Since then, organizers have said they\u2019ve stepped up security measures.",

      "That is especially true, he said, when looking at those who are \u201cstripped, robbed and pillaged, victims of tyrannical political systems, of an economy that forces them into poverty, and of wars that kill their dreams and their very lives.\u201d",
      "From his very first words as pope, Leo has repeatedly emphasized his identity as an Augustinian and infused his homilies and speeches with teachings from the 5th century theologian.",

      "A medieval abbey in Hungary is battling a beetle infestation threatening its ancient book collection",
      "PANNONHALMA, Hungary -- Tens of thousands of centuries-old books are being pulled from the shelves of a medieval abbey in Hungary in an effort to save them from a beetle infestation that could wipe out centuries of history.",
      "The 1,000-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey is a sprawling Benedictine monastery that is one of Hungary's oldest centers of learning and a UNESCO World Heritage site.",
      "Restoration workers are removing about 100,000 handbound books from their shelves and carefully placing them in crates, the start of a disinfection process that aims to kill the tiny beetles burrowed into them.",
      "The drugstore beetle, also known as the bread beetle, is often found among dried foodstuffs like grains, flour and spices. But they also are attracted to the gelatin and starch-based adhesives found in books.",
      "They have been found in a section of the library housing around a quarter of the abbey's 400,000 volumes.",
      "\u201cThis is an advanced insect infestation which has been detected in several parts of the library, so the entire collection is classified as infected and must be treated all at the same time,\u201d said Zs\u00f3fia Edit Hajdu, the chief restorer on the project. \u201cWe've never encountered such a degree of infection before.\u201d",
      "The beetle invasion was first detected during a routine library cleaning. Employees noticed unusual layers of dust on the shelves and then saw that holes had been burrowed into some of the book spines. Upon opening the volumes, burrow holes could be seen in the paper where the beetles chewed through.",
      "The abbey at Pannonhalma was founded in 996, four years before the establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary. Sitting upon a tall hill in northwestern Hungary, the abbey houses the country's oldest collection of books, as well as many of its earliest and most important written records.",
      "For over 1,000 years, the abbey has been among the most prominent religious and cultural sites in Hungary and all of Central Europe, surviving centuries of wars and foreign incursions such as the Ottoman invasion and occupation of Hungary in the 16th century.",
      "Ilona \u00c1sv\u00e1nyi, director of the Pannonhalma Archabbey library, said she is \u201chumbled\u201d by the historical and cultural treasures the collection holds whenever she enters.",
      "\u201cIt is dizzying to think that there was a library here a thousand years ago, and that we are the keepers of the first book catalogue in Hungary,\u201d she said.",
      "Among the library\u2019s most outstanding works are 19 codices, including a complete Bible from the 13th century. It also houses several hundred manuscripts predating the invention of the printing press in the mid-15th century and tens of thousands of books from the 16th century.",
      "While the oldest and rarest prints and books are stored separately and have not been infected, \u00c1sv\u00e1nyi said any damage to the collection represents a blow to cultural, historical and religious heritage.",
      "\u201cWhen I see a book chewed up by a beetle or infected in any other way, I feel that no matter how many copies are published and how replaceable the book is, a piece of culture has been lost,\u201d she said.",
      "To kill the beetles, the crates of books are being placed into tall, hermetically sealed plastic sacks from which all oxygen is removed. After six weeks in the pure nitrogen environment, the abbey hopes all the beetles will be destroyed.",
      "Before being reshelved, each book will be individually inspected and vacuumed. Any book damaged by the pests will be set aside for later restoration work.",
      "The abbey, which hopes to reopen the library at the beginning of next year, believes the effects of climate change played a role in spurring the beetle infestation as average temperatures rise rapidly in Hungary.",
      "Hajdu, the chief restorer, said higher temperatures have allowed the beetles to undergo several more development cycles annually than they could in cooler weather.",
      "\u201cHigher temperatures are favorable for the life of insects,\u201d she said. \u201cSo far we've mostly dealt with mold damage in both depositories and in open collections. But now I think more and more insect infestations will appear due to global warming.\u201d",
      "The library\u2019s director said life in a Benedictine abbey is governed by a set of rules in use for nearly 15 centuries, a code that obliges them to do everything possible to save its vast collection.",
      "\u201cIt says in the Rule of Saint Benedict that all the property of the monastery should be considered as of the same value as the sacred vessel of the altar,\u201d \u00c1sv\u00e1nyi said. \u201cI feel the responsibility of what this preservation and conservation really means.\u201d",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- Just a week had remained before scientists in South Africa were to begin clinical trials of an HIV vaccine, and hopes were high for another step toward limiting one of history's deadliest pandemics. Then the email arrived.",
      "Stop all work, it said. The United States under the Trump administration was withdrawing all its funding.",
      "The news devastated the researchers, who live and work in a region where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world. Their research project, called BRILLIANT, was meant to be the latest to draw on the region's genetic diversity and deep expertise in the hope of benefiting people everywhere.",
      "But the $46 million from the U.S. for the project was disappearing, part of the dismantling of foreign aid by the world's biggest donor earlier this year as President Donald Trump announced a focus on priorities at home.",
      "South Africa has been hit especially hard because of Trump's baseless claims about the targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority. The country had been receiving about $400 million a year via USAID and the HIV-focused PEPFAR.",
      "Now that's gone.",
      "Glenda Grey, who heads the Brilliant program, said the African continent has been vital to the development of HIV medication, and the U.S. cuts threaten its capability to do such work in the future.",
      "Significant advances have included clinical trials for lenacapavir, the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, recently approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. One study to show its efficacy involved young South Africans.",
      "\u201cWe do the trials better, faster and cheaper than anywhere else in the world, and so without South Africa as part of these programs, the world, in my opinion, is much poorer,\u201d Gray said.",
      "She noted that during the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa played a crucial role by testing the Johnson & Johnson and Novavax vaccines, and South African scientists' genomic surveillance led to the identification of an important variant.",
      "A team of researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand has been part of the unit developing the HIV vaccines for the trials.",
      "Inside the Wits laboratory, technician Nozipho Mlotshwa was among the young people in white gowns working on samples, but she may soon be out of a job.",
      "Her position is grant-funded. She uses her salary to support her family and fund her studies in a country where youth unemployment hovers around 46%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very sad and devastating, honestly,\" she said of the U.S. cuts and overall uncertainty. \u201cWe\u2019ll also miss out collaborating with other scientists across the continent.\u201d",
      "Professor Abdullah Ely leads the team of researchers. He said the work had promising results indicating that the vaccines were producing an immune response.",
      "But now that momentum, he said, has \u201call kind of had to come to a halt.\u201d",
      "The BRILLIANT program is scrambling to find money to save the project. The purchase of key equipment has stopped. South Africa's health department says about 100 researchers for that program and others related to HIV have been laid off. Funding for postdoctoral students involved in experiments for the projects is at risk.",
      "South Africa's government has estimated that universities and science councils could lose about $107 million in U.S. research funding over the next five years due to the aid cuts, which affect not only work on HIV but also tuberculosis \u2014 another disease with a high number of cases in the country.",
      "South Africa\u2019s government has said it will be very difficult to find funding to replace the U.S. support.",
      "And now the number of HIV infections will grow. Medication is more difficult to obtain. At least 8,000 health workers in South Africa's HIV program have already been laid off, the government has said. Also gone are the data collectors who tracked patients and their care, as well as HIV counselors who could reach vulnerable patients in rural communities.",
      "For researchers, Universities South Africa, an umbrella body, has applied to the national treasury for over $110 million for projects at some of the largest schools.",
      "During a visit to South Africa in June, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima was well aware of the stakes, and the lives at risk, as research and health care struggle in South Africa and across Africa at large.",

      "China has reported its exports accelerated in June as a reprieve on U.S. tariffs prompted a rush of orders by companies and consumers",
      "BANGKOK -- China\u2019s exports accelerated in June as a reprieve on U.S. tariffs prompted a rush of orders by companies and consumers ahead of an August deadline.",
      "Exports climbed 5.8% from a year earlier, up from a 4.8% rise in May. Imports also recovered, growing 1.1% in the first increase so far this year, according to customs data released Monday.",
      "Exports to the United States fell 16%, but that was less than half the 34.5% drop seen in May.",
      "After U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs of up to 245% on imports from China and Beijing responded with its own steep import duties, the two sides agreed to a truce to allow time for talks.",
      "The retailers and other importers that had largely halted shipments of shoes, clothes, toys, and other items due to new tariffs then resumed imports from China.",
      "But preliminary discussions between the two sides have yet to produce significant progress and sudden changes in policy have raised uncertainty for companies trying to plan ahead.",
      "In the meantime, the Trump administration has hiked tariffs on imports from China by 30%, pending an Aug. 12 deadline for reverting to the higher tariffs Washington and Beijing have delayed for now.",
      "The recovery in trade is expected to help boost economic growth in the April to June quarter. The Chinese government is due to report those figures on Tuesday.",
      "Still, the outlook is less upbeat, noted Zichun Huang of Capital Economics, noting that \u201ctariffs are likely to remain high and Chinese manufacturers face growing constraints on their ability to rapidly expand global market share by slashing prices.",
      "\u201cWe therefore expect export growth to slow over the coming quarters, weighing on economic growth,\u201d Huang said in a report.",
      "Data for the first six months of the year showed that while the trade war with the U.S. heated up following Trump's return to the White House, China's global trade kept growing.",
      "Total trade including exports and imports hit a record of more than 20 trillion yuan ($2.8 trillion) as Chinese businesses diversified their overseas production and export markets. China's global trade surplus in the first half of the year hit $586 billion.",
      "Exports to Southeast Asia grew 13% year-on-year in January to June, with shipments to Thailand up 22%, to Vietnam up nearly 20% and to India up more than 18%.",
      "Trade with Europe also was brisk, climbing 6.6% in the first half of the year from a year earlier.",
      "But auto exports fell after the European Union imposed higher tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, sinking nearly 38% from a year earlier. Exports of auto parts fell more than 23%.",

    "story": [
      "The Indian government has proposed requiring the lowest temperature setting on all new air conditioners to be 20 Celsius, or 68 Fahrenheit",
      "BENGALURU, India -- India\u2019s government is seeking to limit temperature settings on new air conditioners to save electricity in the country that considered the fastest-growing market for them.",
      "The power minister proposed a rule in June requiring air conditioners sold in the country to have thermostats that can be set no lower than 20 Celsius (68 Fahrenheit).",
      "Officials hope the small change will create massive energy savings in the country of more than 1.4 billion people. About 10 million to 15 million air conditioners are sold annually as incomes and urbanization increase along with the temperatures.",
      "The current lowest setting is 17 C (62 F). Officials say each degree an air conditioner is turned up saves about 6% on energy.",
      "Energy experts said the proposal is a positive step, but that requiring units to be more energy efficient would help more.",
      "Power Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said the proposed rule would take effect soon but wasn't specific about timing.",
      "The proposal has gotten mixed reviews from people living in India's sweltering cities.",
      "\u201cOverall, I think it\u2019s good to try and save energy, but at the same time I hope the government makes sure people are not too inconvenienced,\u201d said Vikram Kannan, a 37-year-old teacher who lives in the humid southern city of Chennai with his wife and 4-year-old daughter. \u201cSometimes there is no choice but to set a low air conditioner temperature in cities like Chennai because it\u2019s just way too hot and humid. My daughter gets heat pimples at times if we don\u2019t do this.\"",
      "Air conditioners are fast becoming some of the biggest energy guzzlers in India. Room air conditioners accounted for as much as one quarter of the electricity needed in India during times of the highest usage in 2024, a measure known as peak demand, according to estimates by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley. New AC units added between 2019 and 2024 have increased India\u2019s peak demand by an amount roughly equivalent to what it would take to power New Delhi for a year, the researchers estimated.",
      "Energy demand is typically highest during the summer when temperatures can reach 51 degrees Celsius (124 degrees Fahrenheit) in parts of the country.",
      "If changes are not made, India is expected to have power shortages by next year. India\u2019s hunger for energy is also a key reason the country is one of the highest emitters of planet-heating gases. Clean energy use is growing, but most of India\u2019s electricity is provided by climate-polluting fossil fuels such as coal.",
      "Nikit Abhyankar, a leader of the India Energy and Climate Center at the University of California, Berkley, said that Delhi, like other major Indian cities, now experiences dual peaks in electricity use \u2014 one in the afternoon and another around midnight \u2014 driven largely by air conditioners. While solar energy can help offset daytime demand, nighttime cooling still relies heavily on fossil fuels.",
      "The air conditioner proposal is the latest in a series of government measures over the past decade aimed at saving energy, such as mandating that government offices be cooled at no less than 24 degrees Celsius (75 degrees Fahrenheit). In 2022, the government launched the Mission Life program that includes public service messages encouraging people to reduce emissions by cutting electricity use or skipping unnecessary car trips. The initiative announced with much fanfare has received mixed responses.",
      "Some are supportive of the proposed change to air conditioner settings. Sunil Kumar, a 47-year-old from East Delhi, said the rule could prevent fire hazards and lower bills.",
      "\u201cPeople used to live without air conditioners. We can adjust,\u201d said Kumar, who drives a small commercial vehicle known as a tuk-tuk.",
      "New Delhi-based businessperson Surjeet Singh said turning air conditioners down to their current lowest setting was \u201cunnecessary.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople have gotten too comfortable,\u201d he said, suggesting that cities invest in planting trees to tackle urban heat.",
      "Abhyankar, the California professor, said that while changing temperature settings will help, requiring air conditioners to be energy efficient would do more.",
      "\u201cTightening the minimum efficiency standards can change things pretty significantly,\u201d said Abhyankar, who has also studied the energy sector in the U.S., China, Indonesia and Vietnam.",
      "Calling the proposed air conditioner rule a \u201cstep in the right direction,\u201d Pramod Singh, an energy savings expert with New Delhi-based Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy, said replacing the country\u2019s estimated 80 million older generation, inefficient air conditioners is a key challenge for the government.",
      "Many units available in India are so inefficient they couldn't be sold in many other countries, Abhyankar said.",
      "\u201cAlthough India imports most key components for its air conditioners from China, nearly 80% of the air conditioners that are currently sold in India would be banned in China,\u201d he said.",
      "Energy experts said other small changes can reduce energy use and customer costs, such as making sure new buildings have adequate ventilation, combining air conditioners with other cooling methods and using smart technologies to run air conditioners.",
      "\u201cAir conditioner use reduces significantly if users also run their ceiling fans, as the room cools much faster,\u201d said Abhyankar.",

      "The search for those missing after Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebels sank a ship in the Red Sea has ended as at least four people are presumed dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- The search for those missing after Yemen's Houthi rebels sank a ship in the Red Sea has ended as at least four people are presumed dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for, the private security firms involved said Monday.",
      "The announcement came as satellite photos show long, trailing oil slicks from where the bulk carrier Eternity C sank, as well as another where the sinking of the bulk carrier Magic Seas by the Iranian-backed Houthis took place.",
      "Both ships were attacked over a week ago by the rebels as part of their campaign targeting vessels over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip that's upended shipping in the Red Sea, through which $1 trillion of goods usually passes a year.",
      "The private security firms Ambrey and Diaplous Group ran the search for those missing from the Eternity C, which had a three-man security team aboard but requested no escort from either the U.S. Navy or a European Union force in the region. The ship came under attack July 7 and faced hours of Houthi assaults by small arms and bomb-carrying drones before ultimately sinking in the Red Sea.",
      "The initial attack on the Eternity C came a day after the attack on the Magic Seas. Both ships were Liberian-flagged, Greek-owned vessels.",
      "Ten people were recovered alive from the attack, including eight Filipino crew members and a Greek and Indian from the vessel\u2019s security team, the EU's Operation Aspides said. At least four are presumed to have been killed in the attack, leaving 11 others missing, the EU mission has said.",
      "The Houthis claimed to have taken some mariners after the attack, but have offered no evidence of that. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen said it believed the rebels had \u201ckidnapped\u201d some of the crew.",
      "\u201cThe decision to end the search has been taken by the vessel\u2019s Owner reluctantly but it believes that, in all the circumstances, the priority must now be to get the 10 souls safely recovered alive ashore and to provide them with the urgent medical support they need at this difficult time,\u201d a statement by the security firms said. \u201cThe thoughts of all those involved in the rescue operation are with the families of those who remain missing.\u201d",
      "The attacks on the vessels also raised concerns about damage to the environment in the Red Sea, home to corals and wildlife that draws divers, tourists and scientists. Satellite photos from Planet Labs PBC analyzed Monday by The Associated Press show large, spreading oil slicks in the southern Red Sea where the vessels sank.",
      "Wim Zwijnenburg, an analyst with the Dutch peace organization PAX, estimated the length of the slick from the Eternity C at some 80 kilometers (50 miles) and from the Magic Seas at some 65 kilometers (40 miles). He warned it could threatened wildlife reserves in nearby Eritrea in Africa and elsewhere.",
      "The oil comes from the ship's tanks and had been used for their own propulsion. Other shipping disasters have seen much of the slicks evaporate on their own, though they cause damage to the environment, too.",
      "From November 2023 to December 2024, the Houthis targeted more than 100 ships with missiles and drones. In their campaign so far, the Houthis have sank four vessels and killed at least eight mariners.",
      "The Houthis stopped their attacks during a brief ceasefire in the war. They later became the target of an intense weekslong campaign of airstrikes ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump before he declared a ceasefire had been reached with the rebels.",
      "The Houthis' new attacks come as a new possible ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war remains in the balance. Meanwhile, the future of talks between the U.S. and Iran over Tehran\u2019s battered nuclear program is in question after Israel launched a 12-day war against the Islamic Republic that saw the Americans bomb three Iranian atomic sites.",

      "Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democrats and Republicans don\u2019t agree on much, but they share a conviction that the government should help American manufacturers, one way or another.",
      "Democratic President Joe Biden handed out subsidies to chipmakers and electric vehicle manufacturers. Republican President Donald Trump is building a wall of import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 around the U.S. economy to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.",
      "Yet American manufacturing has been stuck in a rut for nearly three years. And it remains to be seen whether the trend will reverse itself.",
      "The U.S. Labor Department reports that American factories shed 7,000 jobs in June for the second month in a row. Manufacturing employment is on track to drop for the third straight year.",
      "The Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that manufacturing activity in the United States shrank in June for the fourth straight month. In fact, U.S. factories have been in decline for 30 of the 32 months since October 2022, according to ISM.",
      "\u201cThe past three years have been a real slog for manufacturing,\u2019\u2019 said Eric Hagopian, CEO of Pilot Precision Products, a maker of industrial cutting tools in South Deerfield, Massachusetts. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get destroyed like we did in the recession of 2008. But we\u2019ve been in this stagnant, sort of stationary environment.\u2019\u2019",
      "Big economic factors contributed to the slowdown: A surge in inflation, arising from the unexpectedly strong economic recovery from COVID-19, raised factory expenses and prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023. The higher borrowing costs added to the strain.",
      "Government policy was meant to help.",
      "Biden\u2019s tax incentives for semiconductor and clean energy production triggered a factory-building boom \u2013 investment in manufacturing facilities more than tripled from April 2021 through October 2024 \u2013 that seemed to herald a coming surge in factory production and hiring. Eventually anyway.",
      "But the factory investment spree has faded as the incoming Trump administration launched trade wars and, working with Congress, ended Biden\u2019s subsidies for green energy. Now, predicts Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics, \u201cmanufacturing production will continue to flatline.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf production is flat, that suggests manufacturing employment will continue to slide,\u201d Zandi said. \u201cManufacturing is likely to suffer a recession in the coming year.\u2019\u2019",
      "Meanwhile, Trump is attempting to protect U.S. manufacturers \u2014 and to coax factories to relocate and produce in America \u2014 by imposing tariffs on goods made overseas. He slapped 50% taxes on steel and aluminum, 25% on autos and auto parts, 10% on many other imports.",
      "In some ways, Trump\u2019s tariffs can give U.S. factories an edge. Chris Zuzick, vice president at Waukesha Metal Products, said the Sussex, Wisconsin-based manufacturer is facing stiff competition for a big contract in Texas. A foreign company offers much lower prices. But \u201cwhen you throw the tariff on, it gets us closer,\u2019\u2019 Zuzick said. \u201cSo that\u2019s definitely a situation where it\u2019s beneficial.\u2019\u2019",
      "But American factories import and use foreign products, too \u2013 machinery, chemicals, raw materials like steel and aluminum. Taxing those inputs can drive up costs and make U.S producers less competitive in world markets.",
      "Consider steel. Trump\u2019s tariffs don\u2019t just make imported steel more expensive. By putting the foreign competition at a disadvantage, the tariffs allow U.S. steelmakers to raise prices \u2013 and they have. U.S.-made steel was priced at $960 per metric ton as of June 23, more than double the world export price of $440 per ton, according to industry monitor SteelBenchmarker.",
      "In fact, U.S. steel prices are so high that Pilot Precision Products has continued to buy the steel it needs from suppliers in Austria and France \u2014 and pay Trump\u2019s tariff.",
      "Trump has also created considerable uncertainty by repeatedly tweaking and rescheduling his tariffs. Just before new import taxes were set to take effect on dozens of countries on July 9, for example, the president pushed the deadline back to Aug. 1 to allow more time for negotiation with U.S. trading partners.",
      "The flipflops have left factories, suppliers and customers bewildered about where things stand. Manufacturers voiced their complaints in the ISM survey: \u201cCustomers do not want to make commitments in the wake of massive tariff uncertainty,\u2019\u2019 a fabricated metal products company said.",
      "\u201cTariffs continue to cause confusion and uncertainty for long-term procurement decisions,\u2019\u2019 added a computer and electronics firm. \u201cThe situation remains too volatile to firmly put such plans into place.\u2019\u2019",
      "Some may argue that things aren\u2019t necessarily bad for U.S. manufacturing; they\u2019ve just returned to normal after a pandemic-related bust and boom.",
      "Factories slashed nearly 1.4 million jobs in March and April 2020 when COVID-19 forced many businesses to shut down and Americans to stay home. Then a funny thing happened: American consumers, cooped up and flush with COVID relief checks from the government, went on a spending spree, snapping up manufactured goods like air fryers, patio furniture and exercise machines.",
      "Suddenly, factories were scrambling to keep up. They brought back the workers they laid off \u2013 and then some. Factories added 379,000 jobs in 2021 \u2014 the most since 1994 \u2014 and then tacked on another 357,000 in 2022.",
      "But in 2023, factory hiring stopped growing and began backtracking as the economy returned to something closer to the pre-pandemic normal.",
      "In the end, it was a wash. Factory payrolls last month came to 12.75 million, almost exactly where they stood in February 2020 (12.74 million) just before COVID slammed the economy.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a long, strange trip to get back to where we started,\u2019\u2019 said Jared Bernstein, chair of Biden\u2019s White House Council of Economic Advisers.",
      "Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products said that it will take time to see if Trump\u2019s tariffs succeed in bringing factories back to America.",
      "\u201cThe fact is that manufacturing doesn\u2019t turn on a dime,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201cIt takes time to switch gears.\u2019\u2019",
      "Hagopian at Pilot Precision is hopeful that tax breaks in Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill will help American manufacturing regain momentum.",
      "\u201cThere may be light at the end of the tunnel that may not be a locomotive bearing down,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "For now, manufacturers are likely to delay big decisions on investing or bringing on new workers until they see where Trump\u2019s tariffs settle and what impact they have on the economy, said Ned Hill, professor emeritus in economic development at Ohio State University.",
      "\u201cWith all this uncertainty about what the rest of the year is going to look like,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u201cthere\u2019s a hesitancy to hire people just to lay them off in the near future.\u2019\u2019",
      "\u201cEveryone,'' said Zuzick at Waukesha Metal Products, \u201dis kind of just waiting for the new normal.\u2019\u2019",

      "The osprey is in decline in one of its key territories and some scientists blame overfishing of menhaden, an important food for the birds",
      "GLOUCESTER POINT, Va. -- Stepping onto an old wooden duck blind in the middle of the York River, Bryan Watts looks down at a circle of sticks and pine cones on the weathered, guano-spattered platform. It\u2019s a failed osprey nest, taken over by diving terns.",
      "\u201cThe birds never laid here this year,\u201d said Watts, near the mouth of Virginia\u2019s Chesapeake Bay. \u201cAnd that's a pattern we've been seeing these last couple of years.\u201d",
      "Watts has a more intimate relationship with ospreys than most people have with a bird \u2014 he has climbed to their nests to free them from plastic bags, fed them by hand and monitored their eggs with telescopic mirrors.",
      "The fish-eating raptor known for gymnastic dives and whistle-like chirps is an American conservation success story. After pesticides and other hazards nearly eliminated the species from much of the country, the hawk-like bird rebounded after the banning of DDT in 1972 and now numbers in the thousands in the U.S.",
      "But Watts has documented an alarming trend. The birds, which breed in many parts of the U.S., are failing to successfully fledge enough chicks around their key population center of the Chesapeake Bay. The longtime biologist blames the decline of menhaden, a small schooling fish critical to the osprey diet. Without menhaden to eat, chicks are starving and dying in nests, Watts said.",
      "Watts's claim has put him and environmental groups at odds with the fishing industry, trade unions and sometimes government regulators. Menhaden is valuable for fish oil, fish meal and agricultural food as well as bait.",
      "U.S. fishermen have caught at least 1.1 billion pounds of menhaden every year since 1951. Members of the industry tout its sustainability and said the decline in osprey may have nothing to do with fishing.",
      "But without help, the osprey population could tumble to levels not seen since the dark days of DDT, said Watts, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.",
      "\u201cThe osprey are yelling pretty loudly that, hey, there's not enough menhaden for us to reproduce successfully,\u201d Watts said. \u201cAnd we should be listening to them to be more informed fully on the fisheries side, and we should take precaution on the fisheries management side. But that hasn't won the day at this point.\u201d",
      "Watts, who has studied osprey on the Chesapeake for decades, has backed his claims of population decline by publishing studies in scientific journals. He said it boils down to a simple statistic \u2014 to maintain population, osprey pairs need to average 1.15 chicks per year.",
      "Osprey were reproducing at that level in the 1980s, but today in some areas around the main stem of the Chesapeake, it's less than half of that, Watts said. In particularly distressed areas, they aren't even reproducing at one-tenth that level, he said. And the decline in available menhaden matches the areas of nesting failure, Watts said.",
      "Also called pogies or bunkers, the oily menhaden are especially important for young birds because they are more nutritious than other fish in the sea. Osprey \u201creproductive performance is inextricably linked to the availability and abundance\u201d of menhaden, Watts wrote in a 2023 study published in Frontiers in Marine Science.",
      "Conservationists have been concerned for years, saying too many menhaden have been removed to maintain their crucial role in the ocean food chain. Historian H. Bruce Franklin went so far as to title his 2007 book on menhaden \u201cThe Most Important Fish In The Sea.\u201d",
      "Menhaden help sustain one of the world's largest fisheries, worth more than $200 million at the docks in 2023. Used as bait, the fish are critical for valuable commercial targets such as Maine lobster. They're also beloved by sportfishermen.",
      "The modern industry is dominated by Omega Protein, a Reedville, Virginia, company that is a subsidiary of Canadian aquaculture giant Cooke. The harvesting of the menhaden is performed by an American company, Ocean Harvesters, which is based in Reedville and contracts with Omega, which handles processing. The companies pushed back at the idea that fishing is the cause of osprey decline, although they did acknowledge that fewer menhaden are showing up in some parts of the bay.",
      "Federal data show osprey breeding is in decline in many parts of the country, including where menhaden is not harvested at all, said Ben Landry, an Omega spokesperson. Climate change, pollution and development could be playing a role, said Landry and others with the company.",
      "Blaming fishing \u201cjust reeks of environmental special interest groups having an influence over the process,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The menhaden fishery is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that crafts rules and sets fishing quotas. Prompted by questions about ospreys, it created a work group to address precautionary management of the species in the Chesapeake Bay.",
      "In April, this group proposed several potential management approaches, including seasonal closures, restrictions on quotas or days at sea, and limitations on kinds of fishing gear. The process of creating new rules could begin this summer, said James Boyle, fishery management plan coordinator with the commission.",
      "The osprey population has indeed shown declines in some areas since 2012, but it's important to remember the bird's population is much larger than it was before DDT was banned, Boyle said.",
      "\u201cThere are big increases in osprey population since the DDT era,\u201d Boyle said, citing federal data showing a six-fold increase in osprey populations along the Atlantic Coast since the 1960s.",
      "To a number of environmental groups, any decline is too much. This irritates some labor leaders who worry about losing more jobs as the fishing industry declines.",
      "Kenny Pinkard, retired vice president of UFCW Local 400's executive board and a longtime Virginia fishermen, said he feels the industry is being scapegoated.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who just don't want to see us in business at all,\u201d he said.",
      "But Chris Moore, Virginia executive director for Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the country risks losing an iconic bird if no action is taken. He said Watts's studies show that the osprey will fail without access to menhaden.",
      "\u201cOsprey have been a success story,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe're in a situation where they're not replacing their numbers. We'll actually be in a situation where we're in a steep decline.\u201d",

      "Elon Musk's new AI chatbot, Grok 4, is raising eyebrows for its unusual behavior",
      "The latest version of Elon Musk's artificial intelligence chatbot Grok is echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it will sometimes search online for Musk's stance on an issue before offering up an opinion.",
      "The unusual behavior of Grok 4, the AI model that Musk's company xAI released late Wednesday, has surprised some experts.",
      "Built using huge amounts of computing power at a Tennessee data center, Grok is Musk's attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini in building an AI assistant that shows its reasoning before answering a question.",
      "Musk's deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry's \u201cwoke\u201d orthodoxy on race, gender and politics has repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, most recently when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk's X social media platform just days before Grok 4's launch.",
      "But its tendency to consult with Musk's opinions appears to be a different problem.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d said Simon Willison, an independent AI researcher who's been testing the tool. \"You can ask it a sort of pointed question that is around controversial topics. And then you can watch it literally do a search on X for what Elon Musk said about this, as part of its research into how it should reply.\"",
      "One example widely shared on social media \u2014 and which Willison duplicated \u2014 asked Grok to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot looked for his guidance anyway.",
      "As a so-called reasoning model, much like those made by rivals OpenAI or Anthropic, Grok 4 shows its \u201cthinking\u201d as it goes through the steps of processing a question and coming up with an answer. Part of that thinking this week involved searching X, the former Twitter that's now merged into xAI, for anything Musk said about Israel, Palestine, Gaza or Hamas.",
      "\u201cElon Musk\u2019s stance could provide context, given his influence,\u201d the chatbot told Willison, according to a video of the interaction. \u201cCurrently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.\u201d",
      "Musk and his xAI co-founders introduced the new chatbot in a livestreamed event Wednesday night but haven't published a technical explanation of its workings \u2014 known as a system card \u2014 that companies in the AI industry typically provide when introducing a new model.",
      "The company also didn't respond to an emailed request for comment Friday.",
      "The lack of transparency is troubling for computer scientist Talia Ringer, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign who earlier in the week criticized the company's handling of the technology's antisemitic outbursts.",
      "Ringer said the most plausible explanation for Grok's search for Musk's guidance is assuming the person asking it a question is actually xAI or Musk.",
      "\u201cI think people are expecting opinions out of a reasoning model that cannot respond with opinions,\" she said. \"So for example it interprets \u2018Who do you support, Israel or Palestine?\u2019 as 'Who does xAI leadership support?\u201d",
      "Willison also said he finds Grok 4's capabilities impressive but said people buying software \"don\u2019t want surprises like it turning into \u2018mechaHitler\u2019 or deciding to search for what Musk thinks about issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cGrok 4 looks like it\u2019s a very strong model. It\u2019s doing great in all of the benchmarks,\u201d Willison said. \u201cBut if I\u2019m going to build software on top of it, I need transparency.\u201d",

      "Extortion is crippling businesses across Mexico, forcing many to shut down",
      "MEXICO CITY -- It started with a phone call to a men\u2019s clothing store in the heart of Mexico City\u2019s historic center. \u201cI need you to put together 10,000 pesos ($500) for me weekly, or else we\u2019ll have to do something,\u201d the voice said.",
      "The owner hung up and didn\u2019t answer the phone again for days. But when another call came the following week, in a surge of courage and indignation the owner told the caller he wouldn\u2019t pay, that the money demanded would have been half the store's daily income. \u201cWell, prepare to face the consequences,\u201d the voice said.",
      "Several years of escalating threats, visits from goons and armed robberies followed until the shop owner, who requested anonymity because he still fears retaliation, decided to close the store his grandfather had opened in 1936.",
      "Extortion is strangling businesses in Mexico. Much, but not all, of it is linked to Mexico powerful organized crime groups. While some larger companies eat it as the cost of doing business, many smaller ones are forced to close.",
      "The Mexican Employers\u2019 Association, Coparmex, says extortion cost businesses some $1.3 billion in 2023. And this year, while other major crimes are descending, extortion continues to rise, up 10% nationally in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.",
      "In Mexico City, the number of reported extortion cases nearly doubled in the first five months of 2025 to 498, up from 249 for the same period last year. It\u2019s the highest total at this point in the year in the past six years, according to federal crime data.",
      "After the first call in 2019, the store owner had his employees stop answering the phone for eight months. Things quieted, but in early 2020, two men came to the shop and demanded payment. The owner pretended to be a shopper and slipped out.",
      "In 2021, the weekly calls demanding money in exchange for \u201csecurity\u201d resumed. Under advice of his attorneys, eventually stopped going into the shop, instead managing everything remotely.",
      "In one of several robberies, his employees were held at gunpoint, tied up and locked in a bathroom, while the thieves took money from the cash register.",
      "Finally, after two years of threats and robberies, he reported it to authorities. Investigators demanded proof from him that he couldn\u2019t provide because the threats were always verbal, he said. The investigation went nowhere.",
      "Reported extortion cases are only a small fraction of the reality.",
      "Mexico\u2019s National Institute for Statistics and Geography estimated that some 97% of extortion cases were not reported in 2023.",
      "Reporting is low because of a combination of fear and skepticism that authorities will do something.",
      "Mexico City police chief Pablo V\u00e1squez Camacho said in an interview with AP that police were receiving more reports of extortion, but recognized that they still weren\u2019t hearing about many more. \u201cWe can\u2019t solve something that we\u2019re not even seeing or that isn\u2019t being reported,\u201d V\u00e1squez said.",
      "The problem, said Vicente Guti\u00e9rrez Camposeco, president of the Mexico City Chamber of Commerce, \u201chas become entrenched\u201d in Mexico and especially the capital in recent years.",
      "Daniel Bernardi, whose family has run a popsicle shop in the historic center for 85 years, was resigned to the situation. \u201cThere isn't much to do,\u201d he said. \"You pay when you have to pay.\"",
      "Last month, the Mexico City prosecutor\u2019s office announced that it was creating a special prosecutor\u2019s office to investigate and prosecute extortion.",
      "In July, President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would propose legislation giving the government greater powers to pursue extortionists.",
      "This week, her administration also announced a national strategy to address extortion. There will be a phone number to anonymously report extortion; the power to immediately cancel phone numbers associated with extortion calls; local anti-extortion units to investigate cases and the involvement of Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit to freeze bank accounts associated with extortion.",
      "Nationally, extortion cases are up more than 6% on the year.",
      "Extortion\u2019s rapid expansion has to do with the significant sums it generates for organized crime, drawing in the country\u2019s most powerful drug cartels among others. The Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels have made extortion \u201cone of the divisions of their criminal portfolios,\u201d said security analyst David Saucedo.",
      "And with the cartels involved, small-time crooks take advantage of the fear and run their own little extortion rackets, pretending to be associated with larger organized crime groups.",
      "The Mexico City men's clothing store owner didn't know who was extorting him. But without help from authorities, he felt alone and exposed. The threats had grown stronger and they now said they\u2019d kill him if he didn\u2019t pay.",
      "The owner recalled that a nearby restaurant that had opened around the same time as his own store, had closed after its owner was killed, supposedly after not paying extortion demands.",
      "So in December 2023, he saw no other option but to close. Little by little he watched old pieces of furniture carried out of the store that his father had passed on to him as his grandfather had passed it on to his father.",
      "\u201cWhen I closed I felt very sad. And then it made me so mad to think that I could still go on, but because of fear I couldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cYou work your whole life for them to destroy it.\u201d",

      "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is wrapping his up his second and final day at a Southeast Asian security conference with a high-stakes meeting with his Chinese counterpart as tensions grow between Washington and Beijing over issues from trade to security and China's support for Russia's war in Ukraine.",
      "After discussions with regional countries at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations forum in Malaysia, Rubio on Friday was close out his first official trip to Asia in his first face-to-face talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, the State Department said.",
      "The meeting comes less than 24 hours after Rubio met in Kuala Lumpur with another rival, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, during which they discussed potential new avenues to jumpstart Ukraine peace talks.",
      "The meetings come against a backdrop of global and regional unease over U.S. policies, notably on trade and large tariffs that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose on friend and foe alike.",
      "While Rubio heard complaints about the tariffs from his Southeast Asian counterparts, he told reporters Thursday that many of them focused their discussion on security issues, their concerns about Chinese domination and desire for cooperation with the U.S.",
      "\u201cOf course, it\u2019s raised. It\u2019s an issue,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t say it solely defines our relationship with many of these countries. There are a lot of other issues that we work together on, and I think there was great enthusiasm that we were here and that we\u2019re a part of this.\u201d",
      "However, Trump sees China as the biggest threat to the United States in multiple fields, not least technology and trade, and like previous U.S. presidents has watched the country greatly expand its influence globally while turning increasingly assertive in the Indo-Pacific, notably toward its small neighbors over the South China Sea and Taiwan.",
      "Trump has warned of massive tariffs that he could impose on Chinese exports to the United States and preliminary discussions between the two sides have yet to produce significant progress.",
      "Since former President Joe Biden was in office, the U.S. has also accused China of assisting Russia in rebuilding its military industrial sector to help it execute its war against Ukraine. Rubio said the Trump administration shares that view.",
      "\u201cI think the Chinese clearly have been supportive of the Russian effort, and I think that generally they\u2019ve been willing to help them as much as they can without getting caught,\u201d Rubio said Thursday, suggesting the topic would be discussed if he and Wang met.",
      "Rubio and Wang have been shadow boxing during the two-day ASEAN meeting with each touting the benefits of their countries' partnerships with Southeast Asian nations.",
      "While Rubio has played up cooperation with the U.S., signing a civil-nuclear cooperation agreement with Malaysia for instance, Wang has railed against Trump's threatened tariffs, notably against almost all of ASEAN's 10 member states, calling them an abuse and an attempt to subvert free and open trade and a danger to global financial stability.",
      "While noting an overall \u201cpositive\u201d situation in East Asia, in his discussions with Southeast Asian foreign ministers, Wang warned of growing challenges brought by \u201cunilateral protectionism and the arbitrary imposition of tariffs by certain major powers.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Wang and Lavrov met and delivered a subtle but unmistakable warning to the United States over Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cRussia and China both support ASEAN\u2019s central role in regional cooperation, are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and are wary of certain major powers creating divisions and instigating confrontation in the region,\u201d they said, according to Russia's foreign ministry.",

      "President Donald Trump says he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said in a Thursday letter that he will raise taxes on many imported goods from Canada to 35%, deepening a rift between two North American countries that have suffered a debilitating blow to their decades-old alliance.",
      "The letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is an aggressive increase to the top 25% tariff rates that Trump first imposed in March after months of threats. Trump's tariffs were allegedly in an effort to get Canada to crack down on fentanyl smuggling despite the relatively modest trafficking in the drug from that country. Trump has also expressed frustration with a trade deficit with Canada that largely reflects oil purchases by America.",
      "\u201cI must mention that the flow of Fentanyl is hardly the only challenge we have with Canada, which has many Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,\u201d Trump wrote in the letter.",
      "The higher rates would go into effect Aug. 1, creating a tense series of weeks ahead for the global economy as recent gains in the S&P 500 stock index suggest many investors think Trump will ultimately back down on the increases.",
      "While multiple countries have received tariff letters this week, Canada \u2014 America's second largest trading partner after Mexico \u2014 has become something of a foil to Trump. It has imposed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods and pushed back on the president's taunts of making Canada the 51st state. Mexico has also faced 25% tariffs because of fentanyl, yet it has not faced the same public pressure from Trump.",
      "Carney was elected prime minister in April on the argument that Canadians should keep their \u201celbows up.\u201d He has responded by distancing Canada from its intertwined relationship with the U.S., seeking to strengthen its links with the European Union and the United Kingdom.",
      "Hours before Trump's letter, Carney posted on X a picture of himself with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, saying, \u201cIn the face of global trade challenges, the world is turning to reliable economic partners like Canada.\u201d Implied in his statement was that the U.S. has become unreliable because of Trump's haphazard tariff regime, which has gone through aggressive threats and reversals.",
      "When Carney went to the White House in May, the public portion of their meeting was cordial. But Trump said there was nothing the Canadian leader could tell him to remove the tariffs.",
      "\u201cJust the way it is,\u201d Trump said at the time.",
      "Carney indicated he would be willing to be patient in pursuing talks on trade.",
      "\u201cThere are much bigger forces involved,\u201d the Canadian leader said. \u201cAnd this will take some time and some discussions.\u201d",
      "Trump has sent a series of tariff letters to 23 countries so far. Those form letters became increasingly personal with Canada as well as a Wednesday note that put a 50% tariff on Brazil for the ongoing trial of its former president, Jair Bolsonaro, for trying to stay in office after his 2022 election loss. Trump was similarly indicted for his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.",
      "The letters reflect the inability of Trump to finalize the dozens of trade frameworks that he claimed would be easy to negotiate. Shortly after unveiling his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs, a financial market selloff caused Trump to announce a 90-day negotiating period during which a 10% baseline tariff would be charged on most imported goods.",
      "But Trump has indicated that the 10% tariff rates are largely disappearing as he resets the rates with his letters.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re just going to say all of the remaining countries are going to pay, whether it\u2019s 20% or 15%,\u201d Trump said in a phone interview with NBC News.",
      "So far, Trump has announced trade frameworks with the U.K. and Vietnam, as well as a separate deal with China in order to enable continued trade talks. Trump jacked up import taxes on Chinese goods to as much as 145%, but after talks Trump has said China faces total tariffs of 55%.",
      "In June, Trump said he was suspending trade talks with Canada over its plans to continue its digital services tax, which would hit U.S. technology companies. A few days later, talks resumed when Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Under the current tariff structure, the 2020 United States Mexico Canada Agreement has protected eligible goods from Trump's tariffs. But a review of the pact is scheduled for 2026.",

      "Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe has signed a repeal of a law guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers and inflationary adjustments to the minimum wage",
      "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Eight months after voters approved it, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the repeal of a law Thursday that had guaranteed paid sick leave to workers and inflationary adjustments to the minimum wage.",
      "The move marked a major victory for the state's largest business group and a frustrating defeat for workers' rights advocates, who had spent years \u2014 and millions of dollars \u2014 building support for the successful ballot measure. The repeal will take effect Aug. 28.",
      "Kehoe, who also signed a package of tax breaks Thursday, described the paid sick leave law as an onerous mandate that imposed burdensome record-keeping.",
      "\"Today, we are protecting the people who make Missouri work \u2014 families, job creators, and small business owners \u2014 by cutting taxes, rolling back overreach, and eliminating costly mandates,\u201d Kehoe, a Republican, said in a statement released after a private bill-signing ceremony.",
      "The new tax law excludes capital gains from individual state income taxes, expands tax breaks for seniors and disabled residents and exempts diapers and feminine hygiene products from sales taxes.",
      "Richard von Glahn, who sponsored the worker benefit ballot initiative, said many parents felt forced to go to work, instead of staying home to care for a sick child, in order to pay for their rent or utilities.",
      "\"The governor signing this bill is an absolute betrayal to those families, and it hurts my heart,\u201d said von Glahn, policy director for Missouri Jobs With Justice.",
      "About one-third of states mandate paid sick leave, but many businesses voluntarily provide it. Nationwide, 79% of private-sector employees received paid sick leave last year, though part-time workers were significantly less likely to receive the benefit than full-time employees, according to Department of Labor data.",
      "Voters in Alaska, Missouri and Nebraska all approved paid sick leave measures last November. Only Alaska\u2019s, which kicked in on July 1, has remained unchanged by state lawmakers.",
      "Before Nebraska's measure could take effect Oct. 1, Republican Gov. Jim Pillen signed a measure last month exempting businesses with 10 or fewer employees from the paid sick leave requirements. The revision also lets businesses withhold paid sick leave from seasonal agricultural workers and 14- and 15-year-olds.",
      "Missouri's law allowed employees to earn one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked, starting May 1. By the time it's repealed, 17 weeks will have elapsed. That means someone working 40 hours a week could have earned 22 hours of paid sick leave.",
      "If workers don't use their paid sick leave before Aug. 28, there's no legal guarantee they can do so afterward.",
      "The Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry had made repealing the law its top legislative priority.",
      "The \"paid leave and minimum wage policies were a job killer,\u201d chamber President and CEO Kara Corches said.",
      "But Missouri voters could get a second chance at mandating paid sick leave.",
      "Von Glahn has submitted a proposed ballot initiative to the secretary of state that would reinstate the repealed provisions. Because the new measure is a constitutional amendment, the Legislature would be unable to revise or repeal it without another vote of the people. Supporters haven't decided whether to launch a petition drive to try to qualify the measure for the 2026 ballot.",

      "\u201cAll of these actions were taken in order to save my life,\u201d Dali said in Russian through a translator.",
      "Prosecutors say that on Nov. 24, 2024, Dali was able to get through security checkpoints at Bradley International Airport near Hartford, Connecticut, by hiding among other passengers.",
      "She wasn\u2019t able to board a plane, but two days later, she successfully evaded security at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York and boarded a plane bound for Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris.",
      "Prosecutors said Dali was initially rebuffed by a Transportation Security Administration official when she was unable to produce a boarding pass.",
      "But she was able to get through a special security lane for airline employees by joining a large flight crew for Air Europa as they were screened and patted down.",
      "At the gate for the Paris flight, surveillance video showed Dali sneaking past Delta Air Lines staff checking tickets by again blending into a large group of passengers.",
      "On the plane, prosecutors say Dali hid in a bathroom for hours and wasn\u2019t discovered by Delta crew members until the plane was nearing Paris.",
      "During her trial, Dali took the stand in her defense, maintaining she was never asked to show her boarding pass at the gate in JFK and had gone into the airplane bathroom because she was feeling sick.",
      "She was initially released after her arrest, but was apprehended in Buffalo, New York, after authorities said she cut off her electronic monitor and attempted to enter Canada.",
      "Prosecutors have said Dali also appears to have flown into Miami International Airport illegally.",
      "In February 2024, U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents discovered her hiding in a bathroom in a secured area in the international arrivals zone.",

      "Nursing homes around the U.S. say they're feeling the effects of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown",
      "NEW YORK -- Nursing homes already struggling to recruit staff are now grappling with President Donald Trump\u2019s attack on one of their few reliable sources of workers: immigration.",
      "Facilities for older adults and disabled people are reporting the sporadic loss of employees who have had their legal status revoked by Trump. But they fear even more dramatic impacts are ahead as pipelines of potential workers slow to a trickle with an overall downturn in legal immigration.",
      "\u201cWe feel completely beat up right now,\u201d says Deke Cateau, CEO of A.G. Rhodes, which operates three nursing homes in the Atlanta area, with one-third of the staff made up of foreign-born people from about three dozen countries. \u201cThe pipeline is getting smaller and smaller.\u201d",
      "Eight of Cateau\u2019s workers are expected to be forced to leave after having their Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, revoked. TPS allows people already living in the U.S. to stay and work legally if their home countries are unsafe due to civil unrest or natural disasters and during the Biden administration, the designation was expanded to cover people from a dozen countries, including large numbers from Venezuela and Haiti.",
      "While those with TPS represent a tiny minority of A.G. Rhodes' 500 staffers, Cateau says they will be \u201cvery difficult, if not impossible, to replace\u201d and he worries what comes next.",
      "\u201cIt may be eight today, but who knows what it\u2019s going to be down the road,\u201d says Cateau, an immigrant himself, who arrived from Trinidad and Tobago 25 years ago.",
      "Nearly one in five civilian workers in the U.S. is foreign born, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but as in construction, agriculture and manufacturing, immigrants are overrepresented in caregiving roles. More than a quarter of an estimated 4 million nursing assistants, home health aides, personal care aides and other so-called direct care workers are foreign born, according to PHI, a nonprofit focused on the caregiving workforce.",
      "The aging of the massive Baby Boom generation is poised to fuel even more demand for caregivers, both in institutional settings and in individuals' homes. BLS projects more growth among home health and personal care aides than any other job, with some 820,000 new positions added by 2032.",
      "Nursing homes, assisted living facilities, home health agencies and other such businesses were counting on immigrants to fill many of those roles, so Trump's return to the White House and his administration's attack on nearly all forms of immigration has sent a chill throughout the industry.",
      "Katie Smith Sloan, CEO of LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit care facilities, says homes around the country have been affected by the immigration tumult. Some have reported employees who have stopped coming to work, fearful of a raid, even though they are legally in the country. Others have workers who are staying home with children they have kept out of school because they worry about roundups. Many others see a slowdown of job applicants.",
      "\u201cThis is just like a punch in the gut,\u201d she says.",
      "Rachel Blumberg, CEO of the Toby and Leon Cooperman Sinai Residences in Boca Raton, Florida, has already lost 10 workers whose permission to stay in the U.S. came under a program known as humanitarian parole, which had been granted to people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. She is slated to lose 30 more in the coming weeks with the end of TPS for Haitians.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the tip of the iceberg,\u201d says Blumberg, forecasting further departures of employees who may not themselves be deported, but whose spouse or parent is.",
      "Blumberg got less than 24 hours\u2019 notice when her employees lost their work authorization, setting off a scramble to fill shifts. She has already boosted salaries and referral bonuses but says it will be difficult to replace not just aides, but maintenance workers, dishwashers and servers.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, Americans are not drawn to applying and working in the positions that we have available,\u201d she says.",
      "Front-line caregivers are overwhelmingly female and a majority are members of minority groups, according to PHI, earning an average of just $16.72 hourly in 2023.",
      "Long-term care homes saw an exodus of workers as COVID made an already-challenging workplace even more so. Some facilities were beginning to see employment normalize to pre-pandemic levels just as the immigration crackdown hit, though industry-wide, there is still a massive shortage of workers.",
      "Some in the industry have watched in frustration as Trump lamented how businesses including farming and hospitality could be hurt by his policies, wondering why those who clean hotel rooms or pick tomatoes deserve more attention than those who care for elders. Beyond rescinded work authorizations for people living in the U.S., care homes are having difficulty getting visas approved for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses they recruit abroad.",
      "What used to be a simple process now stretches so long that candidates reconsider the U.S. altogether, says Mark Sanchez, chief operating officer of United Hebrew, a nursing home in New Rochelle, New York.",
      "\u201cThere are lines upon lines upon lines,\u201d says Sanchez, \u201cand now they\u2019re saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to go to Canada\u2019 and \u2018I\u2019m going to go to Germany and they\u2019re welcoming me with open arms.\u2019\u201d",
      "Looking around a facility with a majority-immigrant staff, the son of Filipino immigrants wonders where his future recruits will come from.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have ICE coming in my door and taking my people,\u201d Sanchez says, \u201cbut the pipeline that was flowing before is now coming in dribs and drabs.\u201d",
      "Long-term care workers are routinely lured away not just by hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, but restaurants, stores and factories. Half of the average nursing home\u2019s staff turns over each year, according to federal data, making the attraction and retention of every employee vital to their operation.",
      "Robin Wolzenburg of LeadingAge in Wisconsin began working to place an influx of people from Afghanistan after the U.S. pulled out its final troops four years ago and thousands of refugees arrived in her state. Care homes began hiring the refugees and were so delighted with them, some facilities began hiring refugees who arrived from Ukraine, Somalia and Congo. Though many homes had employee retention rates around 30%, Wolzenburg said the figure was above 90% with refugees.",
      "Trump has halted most refugee admissions, meaning Wolzenburg's successful outreach program has no new arrivals to target.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been really devastating,\u201d Wolzenburg says. \u201cOur communities that were actively working with the resettlement agencies are not seeing those referrals to long-term care like we were. There\u2019s no refugees coming in.\u201d",
      "Lynne Katman, the founder of Juniper Communities, which runs 21 facilities across five states, says it\u2019s hard enough to find the right workers with a passion for older adults. Now, just as homes gird for an influx of residents brought on by the country\u2019s demographic shift, they\u2019re facing another challenge to a stable workforce.",
      "\u201cThe work is hard. It\u2019s not always been the highest paying job that one can get,\u201d she says. \u201cBut many of the immigrants who actually have chosen this work consider caregiving a noble profession.\u201d",

      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage edged up this week, ending a five-week decline in borrowing costs for homebuyers.",
      "The long-term rate ticked up to 6.72% from 6.67% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Thursday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.89%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also rose. The average rate increased to 5.86% from 5.80% last week. A year ago, it was 6.17%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. They\u2019ve remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have continued to climb, albeit more slowly.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation.",
      "The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans. The yield was at 4.37% at midday Thursday, up from 4.34% late Wednesday.",
      "Yields moved up last week as traders bet that a better-than-expected June jobs report could keep the Fed on hold when it comes to interest rates.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "As mortgage rates eased in recent weeks, more home shoppers have been encouraged to wade into the market. Mortgage applications jumped 9.4% last week from the previous week, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.",
      "Economists generally expect mortgage rates to stay relatively stable in the coming months, with forecasts calling for the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain in a range between 6% and 7% this year.",
      "\"Mortgage rates may come down modestly over the coming months but other economic headwinds \u2014- including the impact of tariffs on the prices of consumer goods, weaker labor market conditions and rising consumer debt \u2014- could be what continue to hold the housing market in the second half of 2025,\u201d said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at Bright MLS.",

      "Curveballs are disappearing from Major League Baseball as pitchers prioritize velocity, emphasizing sliders and sweepers",
      "ATLANTA -- Curveballs have been thrown a curve by a modern game valuing velocity over variety, disappearing from the major leagues by more than 20,000 annually.",
      "The Athletics have thrown curves on just 2.5% of pitches this season. The overall big league figure dropped from 10.7% in 2019 to 8.1% last year, the lowest since MLB starting tracking in 2008, before rising slightly to 8.5% this season.",
      "There were 22,962 fewer curveballs in 2024 than five years earlier.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really see a lot of people throwing 12-6 curveballs anymore,\u201d Tampa Bay pitcher Shane Baz said. \u201cThey\u2019d rather have a hard cutter/slider. It\u2019s a lot easier for guys to throw a sweeper than it is a 12-6 curveball.\u201d",
      "Baz\u2019s 28.1% is seventh in curveball use among those who have thrown at least 1,000 pitches this season.",
      "Baltimore\u2019s Charlie Morton, first at 39%, learned to throw a hook from his dad.",
      "\u201cHe was reading some article or maybe he was reading some pitching book,\u201d Baltimore\u2019s 41-year-old right-hander said. \u201cYou basically throw it like you\u2019re re-throwing a knife.\u201d",
      "Hall of Famer Candy Cummings, a 145-game winner, is credited with inventing the curveball in 1863 when he was 14, discovering the movement when he threw sea shells into the Atlantic Ocean. Some attribute the curve to amateur pitcher Fred Goldsmith in 1870.",
      "With an average velocity of 80.2 mph, curves are the slowest and loopiest of breaking pitches, often disrupting the timing of batters set for smoke. The phrase \u201cthrown a curveball\u201d has become part of the English language, much like \u201cscrewball,\" more a phrase than a pitch these days.",
      "Sandy Koufax, Nolan Ryan and Clayton Kershaw were among the consummate curveballers, bamboozling batters as balls they gave up on dropped like hang gliders into the strike zone.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become an industry of throwing over pitching,\u201d New York Yankees senior adviser Omar Minaya said. \u201cWhen you pitch, you use different pitches. What we\u2019re seeing in the industry as a whole, especially with showcases, is people are looking more at velocity than pitchability \u2014 as a scout, I said that unfortunately.\u201d",
      "Former pitcher Dallas Braden, now a broadcaster, longs for those days of deception.",
      "\u201cYou almost sympathize with the hitter in the moment because you\u2019re like: Damn, I couldn\u2019t have hit that. He couldn\u2019t hit that. Nobody could have hit that,\u201d Braden said. \u201cThe eephus is now almost like as close as we get, when a position player is on the mound, to an aesthetically pleasing pitch like that, just the visual presentation of the pitch starting in the clouds and ending up at the ankles.\u201d",
      "Nike\u2019s \u201cChicks Dig the Long Ball\u201d commercial defined baseball in the Steroids Era. These days the slogan might as well be: \u201cVelo Rules!\u201d There were just 214 pitches of 100 mph or more in 2008. There were a record 3,880 two years ago and this year is on track for 3,252.",
      "In tandem, starting pitcher use has dropped. Starters have averaged just under 5 1/3 innings this season, down from 6 1/3 innings in the 1980s. Their pitch count averages 85.7, down from 97 in 2010",
      "Average four-seam fastball velocity is a record 94.4 mph this season, up from 91.9 mph when MLB started tracking in 2008. But fastballs \u2014 four-seam, two-seam and cutters, have dropped from 62.1% to 55%.",
      "Those missing hooks and heaters have been replaced by sliders, sweepers and slurves. They are 22.6% of pitches this year, up from 13.9% in 2008, and their average velocity has risen to 84.8 mph from 83.4 mph.",
      "Colorado throws curves the most often at 15.6%, not that it has brought any success to a team that entered the break at 22-74, on track for a 37-125 finish and the post-1900 record for losses.",
      "The Athletics haven\u2019t thrown 10% curveballs since 2017.",
      "\u201cIf you look around the game, swing and miss has taken more of a priority, so guys are trying to throw more sweepers with more horizontal movement, or they\u2019re trying to throw the slider really hard at the bottom of the zone,\u201d Athletics pitching coach Scott Emerson said. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about contact with the curveball.\u201d",
      "Veteran pitchers note the curve\u2019s decline as youngsters integrate into staffs.",
      "\u201cAs you\u2019re an amateur going to the big leagues guys are looking at velo. Guys are just looking at stuff,\u201d Yankees ace Gerrit Cole said. \u201cVelo is important and it pays.\u201d",

      "\u201cThat\u2019s just how the game is trending: to throw it as hard as you can, spin it the best you can and hope the hitter doesn\u2019t hit it,\u201d Emerson said. \u201cThe hitters are up there trying to swing as hard they can. If they hit it with hard contact, make 27 swings that are really hard, you got a chance to hit a homer here and there. And it\u2019s taken away from the contact-type pitchers.\u201d",

      "Jannik Sinner can look forward to his next matchup against Carlos Alcaraz now because he has finally ended a losing streak against his rival",
      "LONDON -- Jannik Sinner needed this victory.",
      "He wanted to win Wimbledon, of course, and it would have meant a lot to him no matter who the opponent was in the final.",
      "That this championship, his fourth at a Grand Slam tournament, came via a win over Carlos Alcaraz made it all the more significant to Sinner \u2014 and to the future of their burgeoning rivalry, the best men's tennis has to offer these days and, perhaps, for many years to come.",
      "\u201cIt is important, for sure,\u201d the No. 1-ranked Sinner said Sunday night after prevailing 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 against No. 2 Alcaraz, \u201cbecause when you lose several times against someone, it\u2019s not easy.\u201d",
      "Sinner had lost five matches in a row against Alcaraz, none more disheartening than the one they played last month in the French Open final. Sinner grabbed a two-set lead in that one, then held a trio of championship points, before losing in five sets after 5 hours, 29 minutes.",
      "\u201cI keep looking up to Carlos, because even today, I felt like he was doing couple of things better than I did,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cSo that\u2019s something ... we will work on and prepare ourselves, because he\u2019s going to come for us again.\u201d",
      "Perhaps as soon as at the U.S. Open, which starts in New York on Aug. 24 and where Sinner is the defending champion. They will be seeded No. 1 and No. 2 again, so could only meet there in another final.",
      "Alcaraz won the trophy at Flushing Meadows in 2022, beginning a stretch in which he and Sinner have combined to win nine of the past 12 majors. That includes the last seven, leaving zero doubt that these two young guys \u2014 Sinner is 23, Alcaraz is 22 \u2014 have pushed themselves way past everyone else in the game at the moment.",
      "\u201cI'm just really, really happy about having this rivalry with him. It\u2019s great for us, and it is great for tennis. Every time we play against each other, our level is really high,\u201d Alcaraz said. \u201cWe don\u2019t (see) a level like this, if I\u2019m honest with you. I don\u2019t see any (other players) playing against each other (and) having the level that we are playing when we face each other.\u201d",
      "Both serve well, although Sinner was better at that Sunday. Both return well, although, again, Sinner was superior over these particular three hours. Both cover the court exceedingly well \u2014 Alcaraz is faster; Sinner has a bigger reach and is a better slider. Both hit the ball so, so hard \u2014 Alcaraz is more prone to the spectacular; Sinner is as pure and consistent a ball-striker as there is.",
      "And so on.",
      "One other contrast, usually, is that Alcaraz shows emotion, whether via yells of \u201cVamos!\u201d or the sort of point-to-his-ear-then-pump-his-fist celebration he did after winning Sunday's opening set by stretching and reaching low for a cross-court backhand to close a 12-stroke point.",
      "Sinner is far more contained. Even his arm-raised victory poses are mild-mannered.",
      "Sunday, though, there were more visible displays. He even shouted \u201cLet's go!\u201d after one point. Later, he shook his racket overhead while the crowd roared after a well-struck backhand. When he took a set with a forehand winner, Sinner held a pose, then lifted a fist.",
      "When the match was over, he crouched, lowered his head and pounded his right palm on the grass five times.",
      "\u201cYou saw a bit more energy from him in the big moments,\" said one of Sinner's coaches, Darren Cahill, \"and a bit more focus to knuckle down and make sure that, when he had his nose in front, that he kept on closing the door against Carlos.\u201d",
      "Both players spoke about their matchup motivating them to work hard to try to improve.",
      "\u201cIt gives me the opportunity to just give my 100% every practice, every day. Just to be better, thanks to that,\u201d said Alcaraz, who won the past two Wimbledon titles and was 5-0 in Grand Slam finals before Sunday. \u201cThe level that I have to maintain, and I have to raise, if I want to beat Jannik is really high.\u201d",
      "Sinner described Alcaraz as \u201csomeone who is young, who wins basically everything.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to be ready,\u201d Sinner explained, \u201cif you want to keep up.\u201d",

      "Gotterup was one shot ahead of McIlroy when he hit his tee shot on the 196-yard 12th hole to 2 feet for birdie \u2014 McIlroy missed from 4 feet \u2014 to take command.",
      "Gotterup's lead was down to one over McIlroy and England's Marco Penge, but McIlroy missed a 12-foot birdie at the par-5 16th and Gotterup hit a right-to-left putt from 10 feet in the heart of the cup for a two-shot lead with two to play.",
      "Gotterup was so emotional when it was over he could barely speak, rubbing his eyes before saying, \u201cEveryone at home ... this is awesome. I'm not going to be able to keep it together.\u201d",
      "He didn't blink the rest of the way on the course after his final birdie, winning by two over McIlroy (68) and Penge (66) for his second PGA Tour title.",
      "\u201cChris played a great round of golf. He was so solid,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cMade the bogey on 15 but bounced back with a really nice birdie on 16. After he got a couple ahead, I just couldn\u2019t claw back.\u201d",
      "Gotterup, built more like fellow New Jersey athlete Mike Trout than a golfer, also won the opposite-field Myrtle Beach Classic last year.",
      "The Genesis Scottish Open had one of the strongest fields of the year, and the perks are far greater. Gotterup, who played three years at Rutgers and won player-of-the-year awards as a senior at Oklahoma, gets into the Masters for the first time next April.",
      "The first stop is the British Open at Royal Portrush. Gotterup earned one of the three final spots through the International Qualifying Series, joined by Nicolai Hojgaard and Matti Schmid.",
      "Hojgaard closed with a 64 to move up 11 spots into a tie for fourth to join his twin brother at Royal Portrush. Schmid shot 71 and tied for 17th, helped by Jake Knapp's late collapse.",
      "Knapp was tied for the lead through five holes, but he took double bogey on the par-3 ninth and the rest of the back nine didn't go much better. He closed with a 74, losing on a chance to win and to play next week at Royal Portrush.",
      "McIlroy had said he was playing his best golf since going into the Masters, which he won in emotional fashion to complete the career Grand Slam. This was the first time he had seriously contended since that Masters victory, good timing with the Open in his native Northern Ireland starting on Thursday.",
      "But he couldn't keep up with Gotterup, who looked shaky at the start when he drove into a bunker and had to make a 4-foot bogey putt. He was rock solid the rest of the way.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really happy with where my game is \u2014 the way I played over the weekend, the shots that I hit, how I controlled my ball flight,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cIt has been a great week. Missing the trophy, that\u2019s about it.\u201d",
      "McIlroy battled to the end, especially on No. 11 when he had to pitch out left-handed and still managed to save par. When it was over, he said he was on his way to Royal Portrush, which McIlroy had not seen since the Friday of the 2019 British Open when he missed the cut.",
      "Former U.S. Open champion Matt Fitzpatrick had a 67 and tied for fourth with Hojgaard, picking up valuable FedEx Cup points in what has been a down year.",
      "Scottie Scheffler, the world's No. 1 player coming off a two-week break, had a 67 and tied for eighth. It was his 10th consecutive tournament finishing eighth or better, a streak that began in the Houston Open.",

      "Grace Kim of Australia is a major champion and can't believe how it happened",
      "EVIAN-LES-BAINS, France -- Grace Kim delivered one stunning shot after another Sunday in the Evian Championship, starting with an eagle to force a playoff and another eagle to beat Jeeno Thitikul on the second extra hole to make her first LPGA win a major title.",
      "Kim, whose 2-foot eagle putt on the par-5 18th in regulation gave her a 4-under 67, looked to be just as surprised as everyone else when she rolled in a 12-foot eagle putt to win the playoff. The 24-year-old Australian calmly placed her hand over her mouth and stood still before doubling over and breaking into a wide smile.",
      "Thitikul's biggest challenge had been English amateur Lottie Woad, who was coming off a win in the Irish Women's Open and at one point had the lead on the back nine of Evian Resort. She closed with 64 and then waited to see if that would be enough.",
      "Woad was bidding to become the first amateur to win a major since Catherine Lacoste at the 1967 U.S. Women's Open.",
      "Thitikul birdied the 17th to take the lead, and the Thai player was on the verge of her first major when she laid up short of the pond and hit wedge into 8 feet on the final hole.",
      "But there was Kim, blasting a fairway metal onto the green. The ball rolled back down the slope to 2 feet for eagle to tie for the lead. Thitikul's birdie putt for the title missed right. She shot 67 and joined Kim at 14-under 270, one ahead of Woad and Minjee Lee (68).",
      "Back to the 18th in the playoff, Thitikul again looked like a winner when Kim's second shot bounced on a cart path, over some rocks and into the pond. Thitikul was just left of the green in two. Kim took her penalty drop, then chipped in for birdie across the green.",
      "Thitikul had to make an 8-foot birdie putt to extend the playoff, which she did. Playing the 18th for the third time, Kim again delivered another beauty over the pond and onto the green to about 12 feet.",
      "Thitikul, who had tiny insects buzzing around her ball in the collar of a bunker, chipped weakly to about 6 feet. She could only watch as Kim ended it with an eagle.",
      "That extended what already is a record streak in the LPGA Tour's 75-year history, the 18th consecutive tournament to start a season with a different winner. It also makes 13 different winners in the last 13 majors.",
      "Kim won for the second time on the LPGA, adding to her title in Hawaii two years ago.",

      "FIFA says it has reached an agreement with players' representatives to prioritize player welfare",
      "FIFA says players' representatives and the sport's governing body have reached a consensus on the need for a period of rest of 72 hours between matches, and agreed that players should enjoy a minimum of 21 days of holidays at the end of each season.",
      "The discussions took place on the eve of the Club World Cup final between PSG and Chelsea. The tournament was held during the European offseason and has faced criticism from unions, as an increased focus on player welfare has been leading to calls for mandatory rest periods and a greater emphasis on player safety during matches.",
      "Days before the start of the month-long Club World Cup, soccer chiefs faced renewed calls to safeguard players over growing fears of injuries and burnout. Last month, France\u2019s union of professional soccer players launched a scathing attack on the competition, saying it is \u201curgent to stop this massacre\u201d amid ongoing concerns about extreme player workloads.",
      "FIFA president Gianni Infantino and other officials from soccer's governing body met with representatives of players' unions from around the world in New York. FIFA hailed the discussions as \u201cprogressive,\u201d adding that players' health is a \u201ctop priority.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is a consensus that there must be at least 72 hours of rest between matches, and that players should have a rest period / holiday of at least 21 days at the end of each season,\u201d FIFA said. \u201cThis period should be managed individually by each club and the respective players also depending on their match calendars and taking into account applicable collective agreements.\u201d",
      "Enforcing a 72-hour period strictly could mean big adjustments to some game schedules and TV deals. FIFA didn\u2019t indicate how it would work in practice. European teams playing in the Europa League late Thursday evening routinely play domestic league games on the following Sunday. With a strict 72-hour break, they might have to wait until Monday to play again.",
      "That would be a major headache for the German Bundesliga. It abolished Monday evening games in 2021 after years of protests by fans who wanted easier-to-attend weekend kickoffs. When it introduced the unpopular Monday kickoffs four season earlier, the German league argued it would mean more rest for Europa League teams.",
      "The new Bundesliga TV deal starting next season doesn\u2019t include any Monday games, either.",
      "FIFA added that a rest day per week should also be allowed and that travel demands as well as climate conditions will also factor into future competition planning.",
      "The Club World Cup involving 32 of the world\u2019s top teams has faced pushback since FIFA announced it would be added to an already saturated calendar. The tournament should be played every four years, sandwiched in between the men\u2019s World Cup, European Championship and Copa America. It went ahead against the backdrop of legal challenges in Europe, strike threats and repeated concerns over players\u2019 mental and physical welfare due to too many games.",

    "story": [
      "A study puts the spotlight on Texas as the leading U.S. state by far for flood-related deaths, with more than 1,000 of them from 1959 to 2019",
      "Even before the Central Texas floods that killed more than 100 people, the state was by far the leader in U.S. flood deaths due partly to geography that can funnel rainwater into deadly deluges, according to a study spanning decades.",
      "From 1959 to 2019, 1,069 people died in Texas in flooding, which is nearly one-fifth of the total 5,724 flood fatalities in the Lower 48 states in that time, according to a 2021 study in the journal Water. That's about 370 more than the next closest state, Louisiana.",
      "Flooding is the second leading weather cause of death in the country, after heat, both in 2024 and the last 30 years, averaging 145 deaths a year in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Other floods have turned deadly this year: Last month in San Antonio, 13 people died including 11 people who drove into water thinking they could get through, according to study author Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio who studies why people die in floods.",
      "For several years Sharif has urged state and local officials to integrate better emergency action programs to use flood forecasts and save lives by alerting people and closing off vulnerable intersections where roads and water meet.",
      "\u201cI think in Kerr County, if they had an integrated warning system that uses rainfall forecasts to forecast real-time impacts on the ground, that could have saved many lives and could have also helped emergency crews to know which location would be flooded, which roads would be impassable,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey could have taken action.\u201d",
      "Texas has so many deaths because of its geography, population and size, experts say. The area where the most recent deadly floods struck is known as flash flood alley because of hills and valleys.",
      "\u201cSteep, hilly terrain produces rapid runoff and quick stream rises, since the water will travel downhill at greater speed into rivers and over land,\u201d said Kate Abshire, lead of NOAA\u2019s flash flood services. \u201cRocky terrain can exacerbate the development of flash floods and raging waters, since rocks and clay soils do not allow as much water to infiltrate the ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cUrban areas are especially prone to flash floods due to the large amounts of concrete and asphalt surfaces that do not allow water to penetrate into the soil easily,\u201d she said.",
      "Along with those hills, \u201cyou\u2019ve got the Gulf of Mexico right there, the largest body of hot water in the entire North Atlantic most of the time,\u201d said Jeff Masters a former government meteorologist who co-founded Weather Underground and now is at Yale Climate Connections. \u201cSo you\u2019ve got a ready source of moisture for creating floods.\u201d",
      "Historically, many of the deaths were preventable across the nation and in Texas alike, according to experts. Masters said nothing illustrates that better than one statistic in Sharif's study: 86% of flood deaths since 1959 were people driving or walking into floodwaters.",
      "Nearly 58% of the deaths were people in cars and trucks. It's a problem especially in Texas because of hills and low lying areas that have more than 3,000 places where roads cross streams and waterways without bridges or culverts, Sharif said.",
      "\u201cPeople in Texas, they like trucks and SUVs, especially trucks,\u201d Sharif said. \u201cThey think trucks are tough, and that is I think a factor. So sometimes they use their big car or SUV or truck, and they say they can beat the flood on the street ... especially at night. They underestimate the depth and velocity of water.\u201d",
      "Abshire said that not only do people ignore the weather service's safety mantra, \u201cTurn around, don\u2019t drown,\u201d but studies found that a number of these fatalities occur when people actively drive around barricades and barriers blocking flooded roads.",
      "The latest Texas Hill Country flooding was less typical because so many of the deaths were in a camp where the water overtook the victims, not people going into the water, Sharif said. Only about 8% of flood deaths in the last 60 years happened in permanent homes, mobile homes or camping, according to the study.",
      "The July 4th floods happened at night, a common time for flood deaths. More than half of deaths since 1959 have occurred at night, when it's dark and people can't see how much flooding there is or are not awake for the warnings, Sharif's study found.",
      "As far as demographics, about 62% of U.S. flood deaths were male, according to the study.",
      "\u201cRisk-taking behavior is usually associated with men,\u201d Sharif said, adding that it's why most fatal victims of car crashes are male.",

      "A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect",
      "NEW YORK -- A \u201cclick-to-cancel\u201d rule, which would have made it easier for consumers to end unwanted subscriptions, has been blocked by a federal appeals court days before it was set to go into effect. But there are ways to end those subscriptions and memberships, even if they take some work.",
      "The rule would also have required companies to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end and let customers cancel recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. But even without the new federal guidance, here are some ways to stay on top of subscription and membership fees.",
      "Experts at the Consumer Federation of America recommend setting calendar reminders for whenever a free trial period ends, to alert yourself to cancel promotional offers before the real recurring costs kick in. The auto-enrollment process, in which the company does not remind the consumer via email that a trial is about to end and higher monthly payments will begin, was also at the heart of the FTC's rule.",
      "\u201cNo subscription business model should be structured to profit from a gauntlet-style cancellation process,\" said Erin Witte, Director of Consumer Protection for the Consumer Federation of America, in a statement on the click-to-cancel rule.",
      "Regularly reviewing your credit card and debit card bills can also help you keep track of any recurring charges \u2014 including price increases you may have missed or that you didn't anticipate when trying out a new membership or subscription.",
      "\u201cCompanies make it easy for consumers to click to sign up and easy for the companies to automatically withdraw funds from consumers\u2019 accounts,\u201d said Shennan Kavanagh, Director of Litigation at the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) in a statement on the FTC's click-to-cancel rule. \u201cPeople should not (have to) spend months trying to cancel unwanted subscriptions.\u201d",
      "Given the FTC's vacated rule, though, companies may still legally require that customers cancel memberships or subscriptions by phone, even as they permit signing up, enrolling, and paying bills online. Consumer advocates say this places an extra burden of time and energy on the consumer to stop an unwanted recurring fee, but sometimes knowing the terms of the subscription and getting on the phone is worth the trouble.",
      "Apps like Rocket Money and services like Trim, which is accessed through a browser, can keep track of your recurring monthly fees and subscriptions, for free \u2014 or for a fee \u2014 and can help you catch new ones or even unsubscribe from some services.",
      "For parents, especially, a service like Trim could help inform them that a child has started a new subscription, game or membership before the fees recur. And Rocket Money will actively work to end unwanted subscriptions for you, for a monthly price. If the company can't successfully end or cancel the subscription or membership, it will give the customer the information needed to do so. Trim also provides this service, in its premium form, for an additional fee.",
      "The FTC is currently moving forward with preparations for a trial involving Amazon\u2019s Prime program, which accuses the retailer of enrolling consumers in its Prime program without their consent and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions.",
      "Often, when a consumer tries to cancel a subscription for something like Prime, which offers free delivery and streaming video, the company will offer a month or more of the subscription at a promotional rate \u2014 half off, or at other, better-seeming values, to entice a customer to stay. Staying strong in the face of what may appear to be a good deal can help you stop recurring monthly fees before you forget to cancel them again.",
      "Agreeing to yet another trial or promotional rate, which is another on-ramp to auto-enrollment, just continues the cycle, according to consumer advocates.",
      "The FTC's rule would have required businesses to obtain a customer\u2019s consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trials. The businesses would have also had to disclose when free trials and promotional offers would end.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit said this week that the FTC made a procedural error by failing to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis, which is required for rules whose annual impact on the U.S. economy is more than $100 million.",
      "The FTC said that it did not have to come up with a preliminary regulatory analysis because it initially determined that the rule\u2019s impact on the national economy would be less than $100 million. An administrative law judge decided that the economic impact would be more than the $100 million threshold, and the court decided to vacate the rule.",
      "Former President Joe Biden's administration had included the FTC\u2019s proposal as part of its \u201cTime is Money\u201d initiative, which aimed to crack down on consumer-related hassles.",

      "Analysis by U.S. national laboratories show the Brook Mine coal contains valuable quantities of the rare earths neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium and terbium, as well as the critical minerals gallium, scandium and germanium, according to a Ramaco letter to shareholders on July 1.",
      "\u201cWe would intend to mine it here in Wyoming, process it here in Wyoming and sell it to domestic customers including the government,\u201d Ramaco CEO Randall Atkins said Thursday.",
      "Manchin, who left office in January after not seeking re-election, joined the Ramaco board in April.",
      "No new Wyoming coal mine has opened in 50 years. Wyoming's coal industry instead has shrunk substantially since its peak over a decade ago, troubled as utilities switch to renewable energy and power plants fueled by cheaper natural gas.",
      "The Brook Mine, stalled in part by landowners worried about groundwater depletion, has been in the works for over a decade. Atkins originally envisioned it as a source of subbituminous power plant fuel, much like Wyoming's massive open-pit mines that supply about 40% of the nation's coal.",
      "A public company with metallurgical coal mines in Appalachia, Ramaco in recent years received Department of Energy grants to develop coal into carbon-based products such as carbon fiber. This year, it got a $6.1 million grant from Wyoming to build a rare earth and critical minerals processing plant.",
      "A consultant report released this week found that fully developing the mine and processing plant would cost around $500 million, a sum that could be recovered in five years if the rare earths can be extracted and sold. Ramaco also would sell the processed coal as fuel, Atkins said.",

      "A dinosaur fossil has been found in an unlikely place, a hole drilled under the parking lot of a Colorado museum where dinosaur skeletons are on display",
      "DENVER -- A Denver museum known for its dinosaur displays has made a fossil bone discovery closer to home than anyone ever expected, under its own parking lot.",
      "It came from a hole drilled more than 750 feet (230 meters) deep to study geothermal heating potential for the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "The museum is popular with dinosaur enthusiasts of all ages. Full-size dinosaur skeletons amaze kiddos barely knee-high to a parent, much less to a Tyrannosaurus.",
      "This latest find is not so visually impressive. Even so, the odds of finding the hockey-puck-shaped fossil sample were impressively small.",
      "With a bore only a couple of inches (5 centimeters) wide, museum officials struggled to describe just how unlikely it was to hit a dinosaur, even in a region with a fair number of such fossils.",
      "\u201cFinding a dinosaur bone in a core is like hitting a hole in one from the moon. It\u2019s like winning the Willy Wonka factory. It\u2019s incredible, it\u2019s super rare,\u201d said James Hagadorn, the museum\u2019s curator of geology.",
      "Only two similar finds have been noted in bore hole samples anywhere in the world, not to mention on the grounds of a dinosaur museum, according to museum officials.",
      "A vertebra of a smallish, plant-eating dinosaur is believed to be the source. It lived in the late Cretaceous period around 67.5 million years ago. An asteroid impact brought the long era of dinosaurs to an end around 66 million years ago, according to scientists.",
      "Fossilized vegetation also was found in the bore hole near the bone.",
      "\u201cThis animal was living in what was probably a swampy environment that would have been heavily vegetated at the time,\u201d said Patrick O'Connor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.",
      "Dinosaur discoveries in the area over the years include portions of Tyrannosaurus rex and triceratops-type fossils. This one is Denver's deepest and oldest yet, O'Connor said.",
      "Other experts in the field vouched for the find's legitimacy but with mixed reactions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a surprise, I guess. Scientifically it\u2019s not that exciting,\u201d said Thomas Williamson, curator of paleontology at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science in Albuquerque.",
      "There was no way to tell exactly what species of dinosaur it was, Williamson noted.",
      "The find is \"absolutely legit and VERY COOL!\u201d Erin LaCount, director of education programs at the Dinosaur Ridge track site just west of Denver, said by email.",
      "The fossil's shape suggests it was a duck-billed dinosaur or thescelosaurus, a smaller but somewhat similar species, LaCount noted.",
      "The bore-hole fossil is now on display in the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, of course, but there are no plans to look for more under the parking lot.",
      "\u201cI would love to dig a 763-foot (233-meter) hole in the parking lot to excavate that dinosaur, the rest of it. But I don't think that's going to fly because we really need parking,\u201d Hagadorn said.",

      "TikTok is facing a fresh European Union privacy investigation into user data transferred to China",
      "LONDON -- TikTok is facing a fresh European Union privacy investigation into user data sent to China, regulators said Thursday.",
      "The Data Protection Commission opened the inquiry as a follow up to a previous investigation that ended earlier this year with a 530 million euro ($620 million) fine after it found the video sharing app put users at risk of spying by allowing remote access their data from China.",
      "The Irish national watchdog serves as TikTok\u2019s lead data privacy regulator in the 27-nation EU because the company\u2019s European headquarters is based in Dublin.",

However, it later backtracked and said that some data had in fact been stored on Chinese servers. The watchdog responded at the time by saying it would consider further regulatory action.",
      "\u201cAs a result of that consideration, the DPC has now decided to open this new inquiry into TikTok,\u201d the watchdog said.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of the inquiry is to determine whether TikTok has complied with its relevant obligations under the GDPR in the context of the transfers now at issue, including the lawfulness of the transfers,\u201d the regulator said, referring to the European Union\u2019s strict privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation.",
      "TikTok did not respond immediately to a request for comment.",
      "TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, has been under scrutiny in Europe over how it handles personal user information amid concerns from Western officials that it poses a security risk.",
      "Under GDPR, European user data can only be transferred outside of the bloc if there are safeguards in place to ensure the same level of protection. Only 15 countries or territories are deemed to have the same data privacy standard as the EU, but China is not one of them.",

      "Nvidia shares rose 2.5%, or $3.97, in early trading Wednesday, topping $164 each. At the beginning of 2023, Nvidia shares were around $14 each.",
      "The poster child of the AI boom, Nvidia has grown into the most valuable company in the world, surpassing Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet. The stock\u2019s movement carries more weight on the S&P 500 and other indexes than every company except Apple. Two years ago, Nvidia\u2019s market value was below $600 billion.",
      "In its most recent quarter, Nvidia overcame tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered AI chips.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, in the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "Nvidia reports its second-quarter results next month. Wall Street is expecting another quarter of record sales and profit for the Santa Clara, California, company.",
      "Nvidia and other companies benefiting from the AI boom have been a major reason the S&P 500 has climbed to record after record recently. Their explosion of profits has helped to propel the market despite worries about stubbornly high inflation and possible pain coming for the U.S. economy from tariffs and other policies of President Donald Trump.",

      "Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company said Wednesday that it's taking down \u201cinappropriate posts\" made by its Grok chatbot, which appeared to include antisemitic comments that praised Adolf Hitler.",
      "Grok was developed by Musk\u2019s xAI and pitched as alternative to \u201cwoke AI\u201d interactions from rival chatbots like Google\u2019s Gemini, or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",
      "Musk said Friday that Grok has been improved significantly, and users \u201cshould notice a difference.\u201d",
      "Since then, Grok has shared several antisemitic posts, including the trope that Jews run Hollywood, and denied that such a stance could be described as Nazism.",
      "\u201cLabeling truths as hate speech stifles discussion,\u201d Grok said.",
      "It also appeared to praise Hitler, according to screenshots of posts that have now apparently been deleted.",
      "After making one of the posts, Grok walked back the comments, saying it was \u201can unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration, swiftly deleted\" and that it condemned \"Nazism and Hitler unequivocally \u2014 his actions were genocidal horrors.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,\u201d the Grok account posted early Wednesday, without being more specific.",

      "Talia Ringer, a professor of computer science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said it\u2019s likely that the Grok update that caused the chatbot to spew antisemitic messages this week was the \u201csoft launch\u201d of Grok 4, which Musk plans to introduce late Wednesday. But if that\u2019s the case, it doesn\u2019t appear ready, she said.",
      "\u201cFixing this is probably going to require retraining the model,\u201d she said. \u201cAll they can do at this point, if they\u2019re really going to launch tonight, are some more Band-Aids, like adding filters on responses and tweaking the prompt.\u201d",
      "Editing some of the chatbot\u2019s instructions \u201cmight make its behavior a little bit better\u201d but won\u2019t fix all of its problems.",
      "Musk and the xAI staff did release the latest version of the Grok platform late Wednesday, with the Tesla CEO making fantastical claims about the intelligence of version 4.0.",
      "He compared its intelligence to post-graduate level in \u201cevery subject\u201d and said while at times it might lack common sense and has not yet invented new things or discovered new technologies, it might \u201cas soon as this year.\u201d",
      "The Anti-Defamation League, which works to combat antisemitism, called out Grok's behavior.",
      "\u201cWhat we are seeing from Grok LLM right now is irresponsible, dangerous and antisemitic, plain and simple,\u201d the group said in a post on X. \u201cThis supercharging of extremist rhetoric will only amplify and encourage the antisemitism that is already surging on X and many other platforms.\u201d",
      "Musk later waded into the debate, alleging that some users may have been trying to manipulate Grok into making the statements.",
      "\u201cGrok was too compliant to user prompts. Too eager to please and be manipulated, essentially. That is being addressed,\u201d he wrote on X, in response to comments that a user was trying to get Grok to make controversial and politically incorrect statements.",
      "Also Wednesday, a court in Turkey ordered a ban on Grok and Poland's digital minister said he would report the chatbot to the European Commission after it made vulgar comments about politicians and public figures in both countries.",
      "Krzysztof Gawkowski, who's also Poland's deputy prime minister, told private broadcaster RMF FM that his ministry would report Grok \u201cfor investigation and, if necessary, imposing a fine on X.\u201d Under an EU digital law, social media platforms are required to protect users or face hefty fines.",
      "\u201cI have the impression that we\u2019re entering a higher level of hate speech, which is controlled by algorithms, and that turning a blind eye ... is a mistake that could cost people in the future,\u201d Gawkowski told the station.",
      "Turkey's pro-government A Haber news channel reported that Grok posted vulgarities about Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and well-known personalities. Offensive responses were also directed toward modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, other media outlets said.",
      "That prompted the Ankara public prosecutor to file for the imposition of restrictions under Turkey\u2019s internet law, citing a threat to public order. A criminal court approved the request early on Wednesday, ordering the country\u2019s telecommunications authority to enforce the ban.",
      "It's not the first time Grok's behavior has raised questions.",
      "Earlier this year the chatbot kept talking about South African racial politics and the subject of \u201cwhite genocide\u201d despite being asked a variety of questions, most of which had nothing to do with the country. An \u201cunauthorized modification\u201d was behind the problem, xAI said.",

      "Filmmaker Peter Jackson's fascination with a large extinct New Zealand bird has led to an unusual partnership with a biotech company known for its grand and controversial plans to bring back lost species",
      "WASHINGTON -- Filmmaker Peter Jackson owns one of the largest private collections of bones of an extinct New Zealand bird called the moa. His fascination with the flightless ostrich-like bird has led to an unusual partnership with a biotech company known for its grand and controversial plans to bring back lost species.",
      "On Tuesday, Colossal Biosciences announced an effort to genetically engineer living birds to resemble the extinct South Island giant moa \u2013 which once stood 12 feet (3.6 meters) tall \u2013 with $15 million in funding from Jackson and his partner Fran Walsh. The collaboration also includes the New Zealand-based Ng\u0101i Tahu Research Centre.",
      "\u201cThe movies are my day job, and the moa are my fun thing I do,\u201d said Jackson. \u201cEvery New Zealand schoolchild has a fascination with the moa.\u201d",
      "Outside scientists say the idea of bringing back extinct species onto the modern landscape is likely impossible, although it may be feasible to tweak the genes of living animals to have similar physical traits. Scientists have mixed feelings on whether that will be helpful, and some worry that focusing on lost creatures could distract from protecting species that still exist.",
      "The moa had roamed New Zealand for 4,000 years until they became extinct around 600 years ago, mainly because of overhunting. A large skeleton brought to England in the 19th century, now on display at the Yorkshire Museum, prompted international interest in the long-necked bird.",
      "Unlike Colossal's work with dire wolves, the moa project is in very early stages. It started with a phone call about two years ago after Jackson heard about the company's efforts to \u201cde-extinct\u201d \u2013 or create genetically similar animals to \u2013 species like the woolly mammoth and the dire wolf.",
      "Then Jackson put Colossal in touch with experts he\u2019d met through his own moa bone-collecting. At that point, he\u2019d amassed between 300 and 400 bones, he said.",
      "In New Zealand, it\u2019s legal to buy and sell moa bones found on private lands, but not on public conservation areas \u2013 nor to export them.",
      "The first stage of the moa project will be to identify well-preserved bones from which it may be possible to extract DNA, said Colossal\u2019s chief scientist Beth Shapiro.",
      "Those DNA sequences will be compared to genomes of living bird species, including the ground-dwelling tinamou and emu, \u201cto figure out what it is that made the moa unique compared to other birds,\u201d she said.",
      "Colossal used a similar process of comparing ancient DNA of extinct dire wolves to determine the genetic differences with gray wolves. Then scientists took blood cells from a living gray wolf and used CRISPR to genetically modify them in 20 different sites. Pups with long white hair and muscular jaws were born late last year.",
      "Working with birds presents different challenges, said Shapiro.",
      "Unlike mammals, bird embryos develop inside eggs, so the process of transferring an embryo to a surrogate will not look like mammalian IVF.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s lots of different scientific hurdles that need to be overcome with any species that we pick as a candidate for de-extinction,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cWe are in the very early stages.\u201d",
      "If the Colossal team succeeds in creating a tall bird with huge feet and thick pointed claws resembling the moa, there\u2019s also the pressing question of where to put it, said Duke University ecologist Stuart Pimm, who is not involved in the project.",
      "\u201cCan you put a species back into the wild once you\u2019ve exterminated it there?\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s exceedingly unlikely that they could do this in any meaningful way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis will be an extremely dangerous animal,\u201d Pimm added.",
      "The direction of the project will be shaped by M\u0101ori scholars at the University of Canterbury\u2019s Ng\u0101i Tahu Research Centre. Ng\u0101i Tahu archaeologist Kyle Davis, an expert in moa bones, said the work has \u201creally reinvigorated the interest in examining our own traditions and mythology.\u201d",
      "At one of the archaeological sites that Jackson and Davis visited to study moa remains, called Pyramid Valley, there are also antique rock art done by M\u0101ori people \u2013 some depicting moa before their extinction.",
      "Paul Scofield, a project adviser and senior curator of natural history at the Canterbury Museum in Christchurch, New Zealand, said he first met the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d director when he went to his house to help him identity which of the nine known species of moa the various bones represented.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t just collect some moa bones \u2013 he has a comprehensive collection,\u201d said Scofield.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Foreign tourists are trickling back to China after the country loosened its visa policy to unprecedented levels. Citizens from 74 countries can now enter China for up to 30 days without a visa, a big jump from previous regulations.",
      "The government has been steadily expanding visa-free entry in a bid to boost tourism, the economy and its soft power. More than 20 million foreign visitors entered without a visa in 2024 \u2014 almost one-third of the total and more than double from the previous year, according to the National Immigration Administration.",
      "\u201cThis really helps people to travel because it is such a hassle to apply for a visa and go through the process,\u201d Georgi Shavadze, a Georgian living in Austria, said on a recent visit to the Temple of Heaven in Beijing.",
      "While most tourist sites are still packed with far more domestic tourists than foreigners, travel companies and tour guides are now bracing for a bigger influx in anticipation of summer holiday goers coming to China.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m practically overwhelmed with tours and struggling to keep up\u201d says Gao Jun, a veteran English-speaking tour guide with over 20 years of experience. To meet growing demand, he launched a new business to train anyone interested in becoming an English-speaking tour guide. \u201cI just can\u2019t handle them all on my own\u201d he said.",
      "After lifting tough COVID-19 restrictions, China reopened its borders to tourists in early 2023, but only 13.8 million people visited in that year, less than half the 31.9 million in 2019, the last year before the pandemic.",
      "In December 2023, China announced visa-free entry for citizens of France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia. Almost all of Europe has been added since then. Travelers from five Latin American countries and Uzbekistan became eligible last month, followed by four in the Middle East. The total will grow to 75 on July 16 with the addition of Azerbaijan.",
      "About two-thirds of the countries have been granted visa-free entry on a one-year trial basis.",
      "For Norwegian traveler \u00d8ystein Sporsheim, this means his family would no longer need to make two round-trip visits to the Chinese embassy in Oslo to apply for a tourist visa, a time-consuming and costly process with two children in tow. \u201cThey don\u2019t very often open, so it was much harder\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThe new visa policies are 100% beneficial to us,\u201d said Jenny Zhao, a managing director of WildChina, which specializes in boutique and luxury routes for international travelers. She said business is up 50% compared with before the pandemic.",
      "While the U.S. remains their largest source market, accounting for around 30% of their current business, European travelers now make up 15\u201320% of their clients, a sharp increase from less than 5% before 2019, according to Zhao. \u201cWe\u2019re quite optimistic\u201d Zhao said, \u201cwe hope these benefits will continue.\u201d",
      "Trip.com Group, a Shanghai-based online travel agency, said the visa-free policy has significantly boosted tourism. Air, hotel and other bookings on their website for travel to China doubled in the first three months of this year compared with the same period last year, with 75% of the visitors from visa-free regions.",
      "No major African country is eligible for visa-free entry, despite the continent\u2019s relatively close ties with China.",
      "Those from 10 countries not in the visa-free scheme have another option: entering China for up to 10 days if they depart for a different country than the one they came from. The policy is limited to 60 ports of entry, according to the country's National Immigration Administration.",
      "The transit policy applies to 55 countries, but most are also on the 30-day visa-free entry list.

      "Aside from the U.K., Sweden is the only other high-income European country that didn\u2019t make the 30-day list. Ties with China have frayed since the ruling Chinese Communist Party sentenced a Swedish book seller, Gui Minhai, to prison for 10 years in 2020.

      "Senate Republicans are putting the popularity of Department of Government Efficiency spending cuts to the test this week",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans will test the popularity of Department of Government Efficiency spending cuts this week by aiming to pass President Donald Trump\u2019s request to claw back $9.4 billion in public media and foreign aid spending.",
      "Senate Democrats are trying to kill the measure but need a few Republicans uncomfortable with the president's effort to join them.",
      "Trump's Republican administration is employing a rarely used tool that allows the president to transmit a request to cancel previously approved funding authority. The request triggers a 45-day clock under which the funds are frozen. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands. That clock expires Friday.",
      "The House has already approved Trump's request on a mostly party line 214-212 vote. The Senate has little time to spare to beat the deadline for the president's signature. Another House vote will be needed if senators amend the legislation, adding more uncertainty to the outcome.",
      "Here's a closer look at this week's debate.",
      "Trump has asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s due to receive during the next two budget years.",
      "The White House says the public media system is politically biased and an unnecessary expense.",
      "The corporation distributes more than two-thirds of the money to more than 1,500 locally operated public television and radio stations, with much of the remainder assigned to National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting System to support national programming.",
      "The potential fallout from the cuts for local pubic media stations has generated concerns on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said he's worried about how the rescissions will hit radio stations that broadcast to Native Americans in his state. He said the vast majority of their funding comes from the federal government.",
      "\u201cThey're not political in nature,\u201d Rounds said of the stations. \u201cIt's the only way of really communicating in the very rural areas of our state, and a lot of other states as well.\"",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Ala., said that for the tribal radio stations in her state, \u201calmost to a number, they\u2019re saying that they will go under if public broadcasting funds are no longer available to them.\u201d",
      "To justify the spending cuts, the Trump administration and Republican lawmakers have cited certain activities they disagree with to portray a wide range of a program\u2019s funding as wasteful.",
      "In recent testimony, Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought criticized programming aimed at fostering diversity, equity, and inclusion. He said NPR aired a 2022 program entitled \u201cWhat \u2018Queer Ducks\u2019 can teach teenagers about sexuality in the animal kingdom.\" He also cited a special town hall that CNN held in 2020 with \u201cSesame Street\u201d about combatting racism.",
      "As part of the package, Trump has asked lawmakers to rescind about $8.3 billion in foreign aid programs that aim to fight famine and disease and promote global stability.",
      "Among the targets:",
      "\u2014 $900 million to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases and strengthen detections systems to prevent wider epidemics.",
      "\u2014 $800 million for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "\u2014 $4.15 billion for two programs designed to boost the economies and democratic institutions in developing and strategically important countries.",
      "\u2014 $496 million to provide humanitarian assistance such as food, water and health care for countries hit by natural disasters and conflicts.",
      "Some of the health cuts are aimed at a program known as PEPFAR, which President George W. Bush, a Republican, began to combat HIV/AIDS in developing countries. The program is credited with saving 26 million lives and has broad bipartisan support.",
      "On PEPFAR, Vought told senators \"these cuts are surgical and specifically preserve life-saving assistance.\u201d But many lawmakers are wary, saying they've seen no details about where specifically the administration will cut.",
      "The administration also said some cuts, such as eliminating funding for UNICEF, would encourage international organizations to be more efficient and seek contributions from other nations, \u201cputting American taxpayers first.\u201d",
      "U.S. leaders have often argued that aiding other nations through \u201csoft power\u201d is not just the right thing to do but also the smart thing.",
      "Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told Vought there is \u201cplenty of absolute nonsense masquerading as American aid that shouldn\u2019t receive another bit of taxpayer funding,\u201d but he called the administration's attempt to root it out \u201cunnecessarily chaotic.\u201d",
      "\"In critical corners of the globe, instead of creating efficiencies, you\u2019ve created vacuums for adversaries like China to fill,\" McConnell told Vought.",
      "The president has issued a warning on his social media site directly aimed at individual Senate Republicans who may be considering voting against the cuts.",
      "He said it was important that all Republicans adhere to the bill and in particular defund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.",
      "\u201cAny Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement,\u201d he said.",
      "For individual Republicans seeking reelection, the prospect of Trump working to defeat them is reason for pause and could be a sign the package is teetering.",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., opted to announce he would not seek reelection recently after the president called for a primary challenger to the senator when he voted not to advance Trump's massive tax and spending cut bill.",
      "Spending bills before the 100-member Senate almost always need some bipartisan buy-in to pass. That's because the bills need 60 votes to overcome a filibuster and advance. But this week's effort is different.",
      "Congress set up a process back when Republican Richard Nixon was president for speedily considering a request to claw back previously approved spending authority. Under those procedures, it takes only a simple Senate majority to advance the president's request to a final vote.",
      "It's a rarely employed maneuver. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, had some success with his rescissions request, though the final bill included some cuts requested by the president and many that were not. Trump proposed 38 rescissions in 2018, but the package stalled in the Senate.",
      "If senators vote to take up the bill, it sets up the potential for 10 hours of debate plus votes on scores of potentially thorny amendments in what is known as a vote-a-rama.",
      "Democrats see the president's request as an effort to erode the Senate filibuster. They warn it's absurd to expect them to work with GOP lawmakers on bipartisan spending measures if Republicans turn around a few months later and use their majority to cut the parts they don't like.",
      "Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer offered a stern warning in a letter to colleagues: \u201cHow Republicans answer this question on rescissions and other forthcoming issues will have grave implications for the Congress, the very role of the legislative branch, and, more importantly, our country,\u201d Schumer said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., took note of the warning.",
      "\u201cI was disappointed to see the Democrat leader in his recent Dear Colleague letter implicitly threaten to shut down the government,\" Thune said.",
      "The Trump administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",

      "Texans are leading flood recovery even as more flooding hits and the search for the missing continues. Mass cleanup across Kerr County \u2014 about 1.5 hours northwest of San Antonio \u2014 came Saturday before heavy rain pelted the region again on Sunday.",
      "For Welch and Elizabeth Hastings, the July 4 floods sent water to their ceiling, wiped out their RV and ruined most of the items in their barn.",
      "\"Up until yesterday, it was pretty bleak,\u201d he said.",
      "Then, Welch said the man in the truck \u2014 Huntly Dantzler of Fredericksburg, 20 miles away \u2014 \u201che showed up.\u201d",
      "\u201cI thought that is just too good to be true,\" Welch said. \"We have hope now.\u201d",
      "In many places, volunteer labor includes debris removal and remediation often done by hired contractors and out of reach for households lacking insurance. Many survivors said it was simply too expensive.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible here in the floodplain,\u201d Welch said. \u201cPaying $10,000 a year for flood insurance doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d",
      "The survivors who spoke with The Associated Press said they didn't have insurance but had already applied for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. That money is rarely enough to cover all the costs of replacing, remediating and rebuilding and only 116 FEMA applications were approved as of Sunday.",
      "Many of those working together didn\u2019t know each other before the disaster \u2014 they\u2019ve connected over social media, in public spaces or just by driving around looking for places to help.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s thousands of volunteers out here, more than needed, honestly. It\u2019s wild, and everyone is just lending a hand,\u201d said Dave Isaacs, who came from San Antonio with his wife and daughter to help.",
      "Three people arrived at Daniel Olivas' home in Guadalupe Street in Kerrville last week with a skid steer and an excavator to clear debris. Water from the Guadalupe River overtook his house on July 4, leaving fish and crawdads floating in the bedrooms.",
      "Soon after, \"33 angels descended\u201d onto the property, said Olivas, removing furniture, scrubbing floors, and tearing out drywall.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing because I didn\u2019t ask for it,\u201d said Olivas. \u201cThey just showed up.\u201d Some even insisted on leaving him cash, stuffing it into his pocket when he resisted.",
      "The help has come from businesses, too. The RV seller Camping World donated a pre-owned RV for Welch and Hastings to sleep in as long as they need. A plumbing company installed a new water treatment system for their neighbor for free.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all heartbroken, and everyone\u2019s just pitching in,\u201d said Monica Watson, a hopsice worker helping Olivas' neighbor, an older man who depended on a wheelchair. \u201cHe was just waiting for help,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she had no connection to her collaborators other than a shared desire to contribute.",
      "\u201cOne guy just said \u2018I\u2019m Ben, I have a Bobcat (tractor),\u2019 and that was it,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "A woman drove by asking if they needed another trailer to haul away trash, and returned with one minutes later.",
      "Volunteering can help people cope with trauma, said Dr. Adrienne Heinz, a clinical research psychologist at Stanford University and an expert in post-traumatic stress.",
      "\u201cWhen something awful happens, a powerful human response can occur called \u2018purposing,\u2019\u201d said Heinz. \u201cThis is when we rise to meet moments of sorrow and adversity with action that is meaningful and values-aligned.\u201d",
      "Purposing \u201coffers a buffer against hopelessness and despair and can set the stage for post-traumatic growth and transformational resilience,\u201d said Heinz.",
      "For those impacted, seeing the care flow in from all over the world is also healing.",
      "\u201cI cannot express how much I appreciate everything that they have done for us,\u201d said Colleen Lucas of Ingram, as staff with the international charity Operation Blessing helped her husband, Dave, repair one of their cars that had been submerged in water.",
      "The staff members from Mexico, Honduras and Chile, along with 42 members of Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, hauled out Lucas' destroyed belongings and packed and stored their salvageable items. She is unsure whether her home will need to be demolished, or how and when they will rebuild.",
      "But she's already thinking about how to pay forward the help they got.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The largest-ever war-fighting drills in Australia, Exercise Talisman Sabre, are underway and expected to attract the attention of Chinese spy ships.",
      "Australia launched missiles from its M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, on Monday during live-fire exercises at the Shoalwater Bay Training Area, a 4,500 square kilometer (1,700 square mile) Outback expanse in Queensland state. The HIMARS launchers were recently bought from the United States.",
      "\"Today was the first time the Australian Army has live-fired our long-range, multi-domain platforms being the HIMARS, so it is a remarkable day,\" Brig. Nick Wilson told reporters.",

      "Chinese surveillance ships have monitored naval exercises off the Australian coast during the last four Talisman Sabre exercises and were expected to surveil the current exercise, Defense Industry Minister Pat Conroy said.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese military have observed these exercises since 2017. It\u2019d be very unusual for them not to observe it,\u201d Conroy said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll adjust accordingly. We\u2019ll obviously observe their activities and monitor their presence around Australia, but we\u2019ll also adjust how we conduct those exercises,\u201d Conroy added.",
      "Conroy said the Chinese were not yet shadowing ships as of Sunday.",
      "The exercise officially started on Sunday with a ceremony in Sydney attended by Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Pacific Lt. Gen. J.B. Vowell and Australia\u2019s Chief of Joint Operations Vice-Adm. Justin Jones.",
      "The exercise, showcasing Australia\u2019s defense alliance with the United States, started a day after Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese began a six-day visit to China, where he is expected to hold his fourth face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on Tuesday.",
      "Albanese said Chinese surveillance of Talisman Sabre would not be an issue raised with Xi.",

      "A historic lodge on the Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim has been destroyed by a wildfire",
      "GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. -- A historic lodge on the Grand Canyon's North Rim has been destroyed by a fast-moving wildfire, the park said Sunday.",
      "The Grand Canyon Lodge, the only lodging inside the park at the North Rim, was consumed by the flames, park Superintendent Ed Keeble told park residents, staff and others in a meeting Sunday morning. He said the visitor center, the gas station, a waste water treatment plant, an administrative building and some employee housing also were lost.",
      "Two wildfires are burning at or near the North Rim, known as the White Sage Fire and the Bravo Dragon fire. The latter is the one that impacted the lodge and other structures. The park initially was managing it as a controlled burn but then shifted to suppression as it rapidly grew, fire officials said.",
      "Millions of people visit Grand Canyon National Park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire.",
      "The burning of the water treatment plant resulted in the release of chlorine gas that prompted the evacuation of firefighters and hikers from the inner canyon, park officials said Sunday. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can quickly settle into lower elevations such as the inner canyon, posing a health risk.",
      "Meanwhile, officials reported progress in battling a second wildfire burning north of the Grand Canyon. Fire lines on the White Sage Fire that forced evacuations at the North Rim and in the community of Jacob Lake were holding, officials said. On the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers were working uphill, and the spread of the blaze had been minimal.",
      "But to the east and north, the fire has spread rapidly, with grasses and standing dead trees contributing to the fire\u2019s intensity, officials said. The fire was pushing downhill toward the Vermilion Cliffs area, and crews were assessing opportunities to create buffer zones that help slow or halt the fire\u2019s progress.",

    "story": [
      "Many Native Americans are marking ceremonies like graduations with bald eagle feathers, a form of reverence for the bird they have always held sacred as a messenger to the Creator",
      "PRAIRIE ISLAND INDIAN COMMUNITY, Minn. -- Some Native Americans traditionally bestow bald eagle feathers at ceremonies to mark achievements, such as graduations, and as a form of reverence for the bird they hold sacred as a messenger to the Creator.",
      "This year, many are doing so with elevated pride and hope. The bald eagle is now the official bird of the United States, nearly 250 years after it was first used as a symbol of the newly founded nation that's deeply polarized politically today.",
      "\u201cThe eagle is finally getting the respect it deserves. Maybe when the nation looks at the eagle that way, maybe there will be less division,\u201d said Jim Thunder Hawk. He\u2019s the Dakota culture and language manager for the Prairie Island Indian Community, a small Mdewakanton Sioux band on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota.",
      "This wide, unruffled stretch of water framed by wooded bluffs is prime bald eagle territory. The size of Minnesota\u2019s population of the majestic, white-head-and-tail birds that are exclusive to North America is second only to that of Alaska.",
      "The legislation that made the eagle official came from members of Minnesota\u2019s Congressional delegation. The federal act recognizes the eagles\u2019 centrality in most Indigenous peoples\u2019 \u201cspiritual lives and sacred belief systems,\u201d and a replica of it is on display at the National Eagle Center in Wabasha, Minnesota, 40 miles (65 kilometers) downriver from the Prairie Island community, which partners with the center in eagle care.",
      "\u201cIf you grew up in the United States, eagles were a part of your everyday life,\u201d said Tiffany Ploehn, who as the center\u2019s avian care director supervises its four resident bald eagles. \u201cEveryone has some sort of connection.\u201d",
      "A bald eagle, its wings and talons spread wide, has graced the Great Seal of the United States since 1782, and appears on passport covers, the $1 bill, military insignia, and myriad different images in pop culture.",
      "But a prolific collector of eagle memorabilia based in Wabasha realized recently that, while the United States had an official animal (the bison) and flower (the rose), the eagle was getting no formal credit. Several Minnesota legislators sponsored a bill to remedy that and then-President Joe Biden\u2019s signature made it official in December.",
      "With their massive wingspan and stern curved beak, bald eagles are widely used as symbols of strength and power. In reality, they spend 95% of their day perched high in trees, though when they hunt they can spot a rabbit 3 miles (5 kilometers) away, Ploehn said.",
      "For many Native Americans, the soaring eagle represents far more; it delivers their prayers to the Creator and even intercedes on their behalf.",
      "\u201cMy grandma told me that we honor eagles because they saved the Ojibwe people when the Creator wanted to turn on them. The eagle, he can fly high, so he went to speak with the Creator to make things right,\u201d said Sadie Erickson, who is Ojibwe and Mdewakanton Sioux.",
      "Erickson and a dozen other high school graduates received a bald eagle feather at an early July celebration by the riverbank at Prairie Island.",
      "Thunder Hawk said a prayer in the Dakota language urging the high school graduates and graduates receiving higher education degrees to \u201calways remember who you are and where you come from.\u201d",
      "Then they lined up and a relative tied a feather \u2014 traditionally on the left side, the heart\u2019s side \u2014 as tribal members sang and drummed to celebrate them.",
      "\u201cIt just feels like I went through a new step of life,\u201d said Jayvionna Buck.",
      "Growing up on Prairie Island, she recalled her mother excitedly pointing out every eagle.",
      "\u201cShe would genuinely just yell at me, \u2018Eagle!\u2019 But it\u2019s just a special occurrence for us to see,\u201d Buck said. \u201cWe love seeing it, and normally when we do, we just offer tobacco to show our respects.\u201d",
      "Some Native Americans honor the eagle by taking it as their ceremonial name. Derek Walking Eagle, whose Lakota name is \u201cEagle Thunder,\u201d celebrated the graduates wearing a woven medallion representing the bird.",
      "To him, eagles are like relatives that connect him to his future and afterlife.",
      "\u201cBeing able to carry on to the spirit world \u2026 that\u2019s who guides you. It\u2019s the eagle,\u201d Walking Eagle said.",
      "That deep respect attaches to the feathers, too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the highest respect you can bestow on a person, from your family and from your people, from your tribe,\u201d Thunder Hawk said. \u201cWe teach the person receiving the feather that they have to honor and respect the eagle. And we tell them why.\u201d",
      "In many Native cultures, killing an eagle is \u201cblasphemous,\u201d he said. It is also a federal offense.",
      "Historically, Sioux warriors would lure an eagle with rabbit or other food, pluck a few feathers and release it, said Thunder Hawk, who grew up in South Dakota.",
      "Today, there\u2019s a nationwide program that legally distributes eagle feathers and parts exclusively to tribal members, though it\u2019s very backlogged. U.S. wildlife and tribal officials worry that killings and illegal trafficking of eagles for their feathers is on the rise, especially in the West.",
      "In Minnesota, eagles are most often harmed by road accidents and eating poison \u2013 results of shrinking wildlife habitat that brings them in closer contact with humans, said Lori Arent, interim director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Raptor Center.",
      "The center treats about 200 injured bald eagles each year. Of those they can save, most are eventually released back into the wild. Permanently disabled birds that lose an eye or whose wings are too badly fractured to fly are cared for there or at other educational institutions like the Wabasha eagle center.",
      "The official designation could help more Americans understand how their behaviors inadvertently harm eagles, Arent said. Littering by a highway, for instance, attracts rodents that lure eagles, which then can be struck by vehicles. Fishing or hunting with tackles and ammunition containing lead exposes the eagles eating those fish or deer remains to fatal metal poisoning.",
      "Humans have lost the ability to coexist in harmony with the natural world, Thunder Hawk said, voicing a concern shared by Indigenous people from the Chilean Andes to the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.",
      "He hopes more people might now approach the eagle with the same reverence he was taught. It\u2019s what leads him to offer sage or dried red willow bark every time he spots one as a \u201cthank you for allowing me to see you and for you to hear my prayers and my thoughts.\u201d",
      "Erickson, the new graduate, shares that optimism.",
      "\u201cI feel like that kind of shows that we\u2019re strong and united as a country,\u201d she said by the Mississippi, her new feather nestled in her hair.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump prides himself on being a dealmaker, but his negotiating style is more ultimatum than compromise.",
      "In the last week, Trump has slapped trading partnerswith tariffs rather than slog through prolonged talks to reach agreements. He ratcheted up the pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. And his administration launched a new investigation into higher education as he tries to reshape universities.",
      "For Trump, a deal isn\u2019t necessarily agreement in which two sides compromise \u2014 it\u2019s an opportunity to bend others to his will. While Trump occasionally backs down from his threats, the past week is a reminder that they are a permanent feature of his presidency.",
      "As Trump tightens his grip on independent institutions, there are fewer checks on his power. Republicans in Congress fear primary challenges backed by the president, and the Supreme Court is stocked with appointees from his first term.",

      "\u201cPluralism and a diversity of institutions operating with autonomy \u2014 companies, the judiciary, nonprofit institutions that are important elements of society \u2014 are much of what defines real democracy,\u201d said Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary and former president of Harvard University. \u201cThat is threatened by heavy handed, extortionist approaches.\u201d",
      "Harvard has been a top target for Trump, starting in April when he demanded changes to the university's governance and new faculty members to counteract liberal bias.",
      "As Harvard resisted, administration officials terminated $2.2 billion in federal grants. The money is the lifeblood of the university's sprawling research operation, which includes studies on cancer, Parkinson's disease, space travel and pandemic preparedness.",
      "Trump has also attempted to block Harvard from hosting roughly 7,000 foreign students, and he's threatened to revoke its tax-exempt status. His administration recently sent subpoenas asking for student data.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ll absolutely reach a deal,\" Trump said Wednesday.",
      "Administration officials also pulled $175 million from the University of Pennsylvania in March over a dispute around women's sports. They restored it when school officials agreed to update records set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas and change their policies.",
      "Columbia University bent to Trump by putting its Middle East studies department under new supervision, among other changes, after the administration pulled $400 million in federal funding. At the University of Virginia, President James Ryan resigned under pressure following a Justice Department investigation into diversity, equity and inclusion practices. A similar investigation was opened Thursday at George Mason University.",
      "\u201cFederal funding is a privilege, not a right, for colleges and universities,\" said Kush Desai, a White House spokesman.",
      "Such steps were unheard of before Trump took office. Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education and an Education Department official under President Barack Obama, said Trump isn't seeking deals but is \u201cdemanding more and more and more.\u201d",
      "\"Institutional autonomy is an important part of what makes higher education work,\" he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what enables universities to pursue the truth without political considerations.\u201d",
      "The Fed has also faced Trump's wrath. He blames Fed Chair Jerome Powell for moving too slowly to cut interest rates, which could make consumer debt like mortgages and auto loans more affordable. It could also help the U.S. government finance the federal debt that's expected to climb from the tax cuts that Trump recently signed into law.",
      "Powell has held off on cutting the central bank's benchmark rate, as Trump's tariffs could possibly worsen inflation and lower rates could intensify that problem. Desai said the White House believes the Fed should act based on what the data currently shows, which is that \"President Trump\u2019s policies have swiftly tamed inflation.\u201d",
      "Although Trump has said he won't try to fire Powell \u2014 a step that might be impossible under the law anyway \u2014 he's called on him to resign. In addition, Trump's allies have increased their scrutiny of Powell's management, particularly an expensive renovation of the central bank's headquarters.",
      "David Wessel, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said Trump's approach could undermine the Fed's credibility by casting a political shadow over its decisions.",
      "\u201cThere will be real costs if markets and global investors think the Fed has been beaten into submission by Trump,\" he said.",
      "Trump originally wanted to enact sweeping tariffs in April. In his view, import taxes would fix the challenge of the U.S. buying too much from other countries and not selling enough overseas.",
      "After a backlash in financial markets, Trump instituted a three-month negotiating period on tariffs. Peter Navarro, one of his advisers, said the goal was \u201c90 deals in 90 days.\u201d",
      "The administration announced a few trade frameworks with the United Kingdom and Vietnam, but Trump ran out of patience. He's sent letters to two dozen nations and the European Union informing them of their tariff rates, such as 30% against the EU and Mexico, potentially undercutting the work of his own negotiators.",
      "Desai said Trump's approach has generated \u201coverwhelming interest\u201d from other countries in reaching trade deals and gives the U.S. leverage in negotiations.",
      "John C. Brown, a professor emeritus of economics at Clark University in Massachusetts, said the \u201cwilly-nilly setting of tariffs according to one person\u2019s whims has no precedence in the history of trade policy since the 17th century.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just bizarre,\u201d Brown said of Trump\u2019s moves. \u201cNo one has done this in history.\u201d",
      "The president has also used the threat of tariffs in an attempt to help political allies and influence other countries' court systems. He told Brazil that he would implement a 50% tariff if the country didn't drop its prosecution of former President Jair Bolsonaro, who like Trump was charged with trying to overturn an election.",
      "Inu Manak, a fellow on trade policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Trump's inconsistent approach will foster distrust of U.S. motives.",
      "She noted that two of the letters went to Canada and South Korea, allies who have existing trade agreements with the U.S. approved by Congress.",
      "By imposing new tariffs, she said, Trump is raising \u201cserious questions about the meaning of signing any deal with the United States at all.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A year after the assassination attempt against President Donald Trump during a Butler, Pennsylvania campaign rally, and the results from various investigations into the shooting are still coming",
      "WASHINGTON -- In many ways, the assassination attempt against Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania campaign stop was a perfect storm of failings coming together that allowed 20-year-old Michael Thomas Crooks to climb on top of a nearby building and take eight shots at the once and future president.",
      "One attendee was killed, two others wounded and a bullet grazed Trump's ear before a Secret Service counter sniper opened fire on Crooks and killed him. That day jolted an already chaotic race for the White House and solidified Trump's iconic status in his party and beyond.",
      "It also became a turning point for the agency tasked with protecting the president. As more details emerged about what went wrong, questions multiplied: What happened to the Secret Service's planning? Why was a rooftop with a clear line of sight to Trump left unguarded? What motivated the shooter?",
      "Another incident in September where a gunman camped in the shrubbery outside one of Trump\u2019s golf courses before being spotted and shot at by a Secret Service agent also raised questions about the agency's performance.",
      "A year after Butler, multiple investigations have detailed the breakdowns that day. Under a new leader hired by Trump, the agency has been pushing to address those problems but key questions remain.",
      "\u201cThis was a wake-up call for the Secret Service,\" said retired supervisory agent Bobby McDonald, who's now a criminal justice lecturer at the University of New Haven.",
      "A Senate committee and federal auditing agency over the weekend released reports about the Secret Service\u2019s actions.",
      "Here's a look at what went wrong, what's been done to address problems and the questions still unanswered.",
      "All the investigations zeroed in on a few specific problems.",
      "The building with a clear sight line to the stage where the president was speaking only 135 meters (157 yards) away was left unguarded. Crooks eventually boosted himself up there and fired eight shots with an AR-style rifle.",
      "The Secret Service's investigation into its own agency's conduct said that it wasn't that the line-of-sight risks weren't known about ahead of time. It was that multiple personnel assessed them as \u201cacceptable.\u201d",
      "Supervisors had expected large pieces of farm equipment would be situated to block the view from the building. Those ultimately weren't placed, and staffers who visited the site before the rally didn't tell their supervisors that the line-of-sight concerns hadn\u2019t been addressed, the report said.",
      "Another glaring problem: fragmented communications between the Secret Service and the local law enforcement that the agency regularly relies on to secure events.",
      "Instead of having one unified command post with representatives from every agency providing security in the same room, there were two command posts at the rally. One investigation described a \u201cchaotic mixture\u201d of radio, cell phone, text, and email used to communicate that day.",
      "And a year later, the investigations are still coming.",
      "\u201cThere were multiple, unacceptable failures in the planning and execution of the July 13 Butler rally,\u201d said the Senate Committee on Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs in a report released Sunday.",
      "The committee found that the agency denied \u201cmultiple requests for additional staff, assets, and resources to protect President Trump\" during the presidential campaign. The committee said that included at least two requests for the Butler rally.",
      "The agency's former director, Kim Cheatle, last year told a House panel before she resigned that the agency didn't deny any requests for the rally.",
      "In a statement released Sunday in response to the Senate report, Cheatle said, \u201cFor the Butler rally, I actually did direct additional assets to be provided, particularly in the form of agency countersnipers.\u201d",
      "Another report by the Government Accountability Office requested by Republican Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley criticized the agency's practices for sharing threat information. That report said senior-level agency officials knew of a specific threat to Trump in the days leading up to the rally. It wasn't specific to the rally but it wasn't shared with the agents or local law enforcement planning for it.",
      "The report said the lack of information-sharing was due to the agency's \u201csiloed information sharing practices.\u201d The report didn't offer details on the threat although reporting at the time indicated that a threat to Trump's life from Iran prompted additional security in the days before the Butler rally.",
      "The agency said Sunday that following the assassination attempt, they took a \u201cserious look\u201d at their operations and have undergone significant reforms to address what happened that day.",
      "Earlier this week the agency issued its own report Thursday about what it has done.",
      "\u201cSince President Trump appointed me as director of the United States Secret Service, I have kept my experience on July 13 top of mind, and the agency has taken many steps to ensure such an event can never be repeated in the future,\u201d said Sean Curran, whom Trump tasked with leading the agency. Curran was one of the agents standing next to Trump as he was hustled off the stage after the shooting.",
      "The agency said it had implemented 21 of the 46 recommendations made by Congressional oversight bodies. The rest were either in progress or not up to the agency to implement.",
      "Some of what they've done involves new equipment and a greater emphasis on addressing threats from above. They've created a new Aviation Division to oversee aerial operations like drones. The agency said it has two armored ATVs for use on golf courses and is producing another three. And they're purchasing mobile command vehicles that will be pre-positioned around the country.",
      "But much of what the agency says it has done is about changing policies and procedures to address those July 13 lapses \u2014 things like revising their manual to \u201cadvance procedures and communication practices\u201d when it comes to coordinating with local law enforcement or clarifying who's responsible for events where protectees are appearing.",
      "They've updated their procedures about documenting line-of-sight concerns and how those concerns are going to be addressed.",
      "So far it doesn't appear that anyone has been or will be fired, although the agency's director at the time, Cheatle, swiftly resigned. The agency said Thursday that six staffers have been disciplined with suspensions ranging from 10 to 42 days without pay; the six were placed on restricted duty or nonoperational positions. Their identities and positions were not released.",
      "The lack of firings has led to criticism. The Senate report said more than six people should have been disciplined and the penalties were too weak to match the severity of what happened.",
      "In many ways Crooks and his motivations are still a mystery.",
      "He was killed by a Secret Service countersniper and did not leave much information about why he did what he did. Investigators say they believe he acted alone and they didn't find any threatening comments or ideological positions on social media that shed light on his thinking.",
      "And while it's clear what went wrong in Butler, questions linger about how things that were so clearly problematic \u2014 like that open roof \u2014 weren't addressed ahead of time.",
      "Anthony Cangelosi, a former Secret Service agent who is now a lecturer at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that without being able to read the interviews with the agents involved in the Butler planning it's hard to know exactly why they did what they did. A year later, he still struggles with how so many things went wrong.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t understand how many errors were made on that site that day,\" he said. \u201cIf they agreed to leave that roof unoccupied, I can\u2019t ... understand it for the life of me.\u201d",
      "The widow of Corey Comperatore, who died during the Butler assassination attempt, echoed some of that sentiment during an interview with Fox News this week.",
      "\u201cWhy was that such a failure? Why weren\u2019t they paying attention? Why did they think that that roof didn\u2019t need covered? I want to sit down and talk to them,\u201d Helen Comperatore said.",
      "Cangelosi said he still questions whether the agency asked for additional personnel to cover a busy election year and if they did, whether those requests were granted. He thinks the Secret Service needs better pay to retain agents tempted to leave the agency for other federal government jobs.",
      "McDonald said he suspects part of the problem ahead of the Butler rally was that the Secret Service might have had a hard time understanding that the type of protection Trump needed wasn't the same as for other former presidents.",
      "He said it \u201cboggles the mind\u201d how Crooks was able to get on that roof and said that \u201ccommunication\u201d and \u201ccomplacency\u201d are the two issues that he thinks really went wrong in Butler.",
      "But he also said that he feels the agency is moving in the right direction. \u201cA lot of good people doing a lot good work there,\" he said, \u201cand I hope they continue to move in the right direction.\u201d",

      "Sotheby's is putting some rare items up for auction, including what it calls the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth",
      "NEW YORK -- For sale: A 54-pound (25-kilogram) rock. Estimated auction price: $2 million to $4 million. Why so expensive? It's the largest piece of Mars ever found on Earth.",
      "Sotheby's in New York will be auctioning what's known as NWA 16788 on Wednesday as part of a natural history-themed sale that also includes a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton that's more than 6 feet (2 meters) tall and nearly 11 feet (3 meters) long.",
      "According to the auction house, the meteorite is believed to have been blown off the surface of Mars by a massive asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) to Earth, where it crashed into the Sahara. A meteorite hunter found it in Niger in November 2023, Sotheby's says.",
      "The red, brown and gray hunk is about 70% larger than the next largest piece of Mars found on Earth and represents nearly 7% of all the Martian material currently on this planet, Sotheby's says. It measures nearly 15 inches by 11 inches by 6 inches (375 millimeters by 279 millimeters by 152 millimeters).",
      "\u201cThis Martian meteorite is the largest piece of Mars we have ever found by a long shot,\" Cassandra Hatton, vice chairman for science and natural history at Sotheby's, said in an interview. \u201cSo it\u2019s more than double the size of what we previously thought was the largest piece of Mars.\u201d",
      "It is also a rare find. There are only 400 Martian meteorites out of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth, Sotheby's says.",
      "Hatton said a small piece of the red planet remnant was removed and sent to a specialized lab that confirmed it is from Mars. It was compared with the distinct chemical composition of Martian meteorites discovered during the Viking space probe that landed on Mars in 1976, she said.",
      "The examination found that it is an \u201colivine-microgabbroic shergottite,\u201d a type of Martian rock formed from the slow cooling of Martian magma. It has a course-grained texture and contains the minerals pyroxene and olivine, Sotheby's says.",
      "It also has a glassy surface, likely due to the high heat that burned it when it fell through Earth's atmosphere, Hatton said. \u201cSo that was their first clue that this wasn't just some big rock on the ground,\u201d she said.",
      "The meteorite previously was on exhibit at the Italian Space Agency in Rome. Sotheby's did not disclose the owner.",
      "It's not clear exactly when the meteorite hit Earth, but testing shows it probably happened in recent years, Sotheby's said.",
      "The juvenile Ceratosaurus nasicornis skeleton was found in 1996 near Laramie, Wyoming, at Bone Cabin Quarry, a gold mine for dinosaur bones. Specialists assembled nearly 140 fossil bones with some sculpted materials to recreate the skeleton and mounted it so it's ready to exhibit, Sotheby's says.",
      "The skeleton is believed to be from the late Jurassic period, about 150 million years ago, Sotheby's says. It's auction estimate is $4 million to $6 million.",
      "Ceratosaurus dinosaurs were bipeds with short arms that appear similar to the Tyrannosaurus rex, but smaller. Ceratosaurus dinosaurs could grow up to 25 feet (7.6 meters) long, while the Tyrannosaurs rex could be 40 feet (12 meters) long.",
      "The skeleton was acquired last year by Fossilogic, a Utah-based fossil preparation and mounting company.",
      "Wednesday's auction is part of Sotheby's Geek Week 2025 and features 122 items, including other meteorites, fossils and gem-quality minerals.",

    "story": [
      "The new tax law signed by President Donald Trump creates a federal tax deduction for interest on auto loans",
      "Millions of people receive a federal tax deduction for the interest they pay on home loans. Under President Donald Trump\u2019s new tax-cut law, many people for the first time also could claim a tax deduction for interest on their vehicle loans.",
      "The new tax break will be available even to people who don't itemize deductions. But there are some caveats that could limit its reach. The vehicles must be new, not used. They must be assembled in the U.S. And the loans must be issued no sooner than this year, to list just a few qualifications.",
      "Here are some things to know about the new auto loan interest tax deduction:",
      "Trump pledged while campaigning last year to make interest on car loans tax-deductible. He said it would make car ownership more affordable and \u201cstimulate massive domestic auto production.\u201d",
      "The idea made it into the big tax-cut bill passed by Congress, which Trump signed into law July 4.",
      "The law allows taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 of interest payments annually on loans for new American-made vehicles from 2025 through 2028. It applies to cars, motorcycles, sport utility vehicles, minivans, vans and pickup trucks weighing less than 14,000 pounds, a threshold referred to as light vehicles. But it only applies to vehicles purchased for personal use, not for fleets or commercial purposes.",
      "The tax break can be claimed starting on 2025 income tax returns. But the deduction phases out for individuals with incomes between $100,000 and $150,000 or joint taxpayers with incomes between $200,000 and $250,000. Those earning more cannot claim the tax break.",
      "U.S. automobile dealers sold 15.9 million new light vehicles last year, a little over half of which were assembled in the U.S, according to Cox Automotive. It says around 60% of retail sales are financed with loans.",
      "After excluding fleet and commercial vehicles and customers above the income cutoff, an estimated 3.5 million new vehicle loans could be eligible for the tax break this year, if purchasing patterns stay the same, said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive.",
      "The tax break applies to vehicles assembled in the U.S., no matter where the company making them is headquartered. All Tesla vehicles sold in the U.S. are assembled in this country. But so are all Acura brands, the luxury model of Japanese automaker Honda.",
      "Last year, 78% of Ford vehicles sold in the U.S. were assembled in this country, according to Cox Automotive. But customers wanting the tax break will need to pay attention to specific models. While the Ford Mustang is assembled in Michigan, the Mustang Mach-E is built in Mexico.",
      "General Motors assembles all of its Cadillacs in the U.S. But just 44% of its Chevrolets sold last year were assembled in the U.S., and just 14% of Buicks, according to Cox Automotive. That's a lower U.S-assembled rate than Honda (60%), Toyota (52%) and Nissan (48%), which all are headquartered in Japan.",
      "The average new vehicle loan is about $44,000 financed over six years. Interest rates vary by customer, so the savings will, too. In general, the tax deduction will decline after the initial year, because interest payments on loans are frontloaded while principal payments grow on the back end.",
      "At a 9.3% interest rate, an average new vehicle buyer could save about $2,200 on taxes over four years, Smoke said. The tax savings would be less on a loan at 6.5%, which is the rate figured into calculations by the American Financial Services Association, a consumer credit industry trade group.",
      "Whereas the tax deduction for home loan interest can be claimed only by people itemizing on their tax returns, Congress wrote the deduction for auto loan interest so that it can apply to all taxpayers, including those claiming the standard deduction.",
      "On a tax form, the auto loan deduction will come before the calculation of a taxpayer's adjusted gross income. That's an important distinction, because many states use a taxpayer's federal adjusted gross income as the starting point for figuring their state income taxes. If that income figure is lower, it could reduce the state taxes owed.",
      "At Bowen Scarff Ford in Kent, Washington, customers started asking about the auto loan tax deduction before Congress had even taken a final vote on the tax-cut bill, said General Manager Paul Ray. So he decided to promote it on the dealer's website.",
      "A website ribbon exclaims: \u201cCAR LOAN TAX DEDUCTION NOW AVAILABLE\" while also promoting an electric vehicle tax credit that is ending soon as a result of Trump's tax-cut law.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to help incentivize vehicle purchases through this year,\" Ray said.",
      "Celia Winslow, president and CEO of the American Financial Services Association, concurred: \u201cFor some people deciding \u2014 should I buy it, should I not \u2014 this could be something that tips the scale.\u201d",
      "Others remain skeptical. According to Smoke's math, the average annual tax savings is smaller than a single month's loan payment for a new vehicle.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it moves the needle on somebody on the fence of buying a new vehicle or not,\" Smoke said. \"But I think it could influence their decision to finance that vehicle instead of paying cash or instead of leasing a vehicle.\u201d",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A farmworker who fell from a greenhouse roof during a chaotic ICE raid this week at a California cannabis facility died Saturday of his injuries.",
      "Jaime Alanis, 57, is the first known person to die during one of the Trump administration\u2019s ongoing immigration enforcement operations. Yesenia Duran, Alanis' niece, confirmed his death to The Associated Press.",
      "Duran posted on the fundraising site GoFundMe that her uncle was his family's only provider and he had been sending his earnings back to a wife and daughter in Mexico. Alanis worked at the farm for 10 years, his family said.",
      "The United Farm Workers reported Alanis\u2019 death prematurely late Friday. The Ventura County Medical Center later issued a statement authorized by the family saying he was still on life support.",
      "\u201cThese violent and cruel federal actions terrorize American communities, disrupt the American food supply chain, threaten lives and separate families,\u201d the UFW said recently in a statement on the social platform X. The union does not represent workers at the raided farm.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said it executed criminal search warrants Thursday at Glass House Farms facilities in Camarillo and Carpinteria. Glass House is a licensed cannabis grower. The farm in Camarillo also grows tomatoes and cucumbers.",
      "Alanis called family to say he was hiding and possibly was fleeing agents before he fell about 30 feet (9 meters) from the roof and broke his neck, according to information from family, hospital and government sources.",
      "Agents arrested some 200 people suspected of being in the country illegally and identified at least 10 immigrant children on the sites, DHS said in a statement. Alanis was not among them, the agency said.",
      "\u201cThis man was not in and has not been in CBP or ICE custody,\u201d DHS Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. \u201cAlthough he was not being pursued by law enforcement, this individual climbed up to the roof of a greenhouse and fell 30 feet. CBP immediately called a medivac to the scene to get him care as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Four U.S. citizens were arrested during the incident for allegedly \u201cassaulting or resisting officers,\u201d according to DHS, and authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of a person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents.",
      "During the raid crowds of people gathered outside the facility in Camarillo to seek information about their relatives and protest immigration enforcement. Authorities clad in military-style helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators, and people ultimately retreated amid acrid green and white billowing smoke.",

      "The United States\u2019 long legal case against accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed remains in limbo after an appeals court scrapped a plea deal",
      "NEW YORK -- The United States' long legal case against accused Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed remains in limbo after an appeals court this week scrapped a plea deal that the government had negotiated but had later withdrawn.",
      "Essentially, the ruling leaves the case on track for trial before a military commission. It is unclear when that might happen.",
      "Here's what to know about the case and how it got here:",
      "Mohammed is accused of developing and directing al-Qaida\u2019s plot to crash hijacked airliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. Another of the hijacked planes flew into a field in Pennsylvania. In all, nearly 3,000 people were killed in one of the deadliest attacks ever on the United States.",
      "Mohammed was arrested in 2003 in Pakistan and eventually taken to the U.S. military base at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. At the time, it was where the U.S. held hundreds of men captured in President George W. Bush's \u201cwar on terror.\u201d",
      "Military prosecutors filed charges in 2008 against Mohammed and some co-defendants. After an Obama-era plan to try them in a civilian court in New York collapsed, the case remained with the military commission.",
      "The case dragged on through years of legal and logistical challenges. A major point of contention has been how much the evidence and case have been tainted by the men\u2019s torture while in CIA custody during the first years after their capture. Mohammed was waterboarded 183 times.",
      "Military prosecutors and defense lawyers began plea talks several years ago. Last year, Mohammed and two others agreed to plead guilty, under an agreement that would have led to life in prison instead of a potential death penalty. The deal also would have required the men to answer questions posed by Sept. 11 victims' relatives.",
      "Military prosecutors called the arrangement \u201cthe best path to finality and justice.\u201d Some 9/11 families also saw the deal as the best hope for bringing the painful case to a conclusion and getting some answers from the defendants.",
      "But other victims\u2019 relatives said a trial was the right way to get justice and information, and some saw the plea deal as capitulation. Republican lawmakers also criticized the agreement, negotiated during Democratic President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "Then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin soon rescinded the deal, saying that victims' relatives, U.S. troops and the American public \u201c deserve the opportunity \u201d to see military commission trials play out.",
      "Defense attorneys and the government wrangled in various courts over whether Austin was legally able to scrap the deal. It was on-again, off-again for months. A panel of appeals judges put it on hold in January and then, on Friday, issued 2-1 ruling saying that Austin had the authority to rescind the agreement. The order bars the military judge from taking any guilty pleas under the now-undone deal.",
      "It is not clear whether defense lawyers plan to appeal. A message seeking comment was sent Saturday to Mohammed's attorneys.",
      "Without a plea deal, the case would once again be back in the pretrial stage within the military commission system, with the legal and logistical complications that it has faced. Questions about whether the men's torture would prevent the use of evidence, including statements they made, are yet to be resolved.",

      "Wildfire smoke from Canada has made for bad air quality over parts of the Upper Midwest",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Much of the Upper Midwest on Saturday was dealing with swaths of unhealthy air because of drifting smoke from Canadian wildfires, covering the northern region of the U.S. at a time when people want to be enjoying lakes, trails and the great outdoors.",
      "Most of Minnesota and parts of Montana, North Dakota and Wisconsin were ranked \u201cunhealthy\u201d for air quality on a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency map. Part of North Dakota that is home to Theodore Roosevelt National Park and other tourist attractions was ranked \u201cvery unhealthy,\u201d some of the worst air quality in the nation.",
      "In Minnesota, \u201cIf you have a nice pork loin you can hang from a tree, it'll turn into ham,\u201d quipped Al Chirpich, owner of the Hideaway Resort near Detroit Lakes, where people come to enjoy tree-lined Island Lake for fishing and other water activities.",
      "Normally there would be boats and jet skis all over, but on Saturday he couldn't see a boat on the lake, where the smoke impaired visibility and curtailed his camper business. None of his 18 RV sites was occupied. His seven rental cabins drew a handful of customers.",
      "\u201cI suspect when the weather clears, we'll be swamped again. Fourth of July, I had probably 20 boats here lined up at my docks, and today my boat is the only one,\u201d Chirpich said.",
      "The conditions started Friday, dragging smoke from the Canadian wildfires down to the surface, said National Weather Service Meteorologist Jennifer Ritterling, in Grand Forks. Periods of bad air quality are expected to last through the weekend in the region, she said.",
      "Limiting time outdoors, keeping windows closed and running air purifiers are good ideas for people with lung conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and even healthy people, Ritterling said.",
      "\u201cOur summers up here are fairly short and so everyone wants to get out and enjoy them, and it\u2019s a little frustrating when there\u2019s this smoke in the air,\u201d she said.",
      "All of Manitoba is under a state of emergency because of the wildfires, which have led to 12,600 people evacuating their homes in the province. The fires in the central Canadian province have burned over 3,861 square miles (10,000 square kilometers), the most land burned in 30 years of electronic record-keeping.",
      "Under 1,000 people have evacuated their homes in Saskatchewan, where wildfires also continue to burn.",
      "In Arizona, the North Rim in Grand Canyon National Park is still closed because of a 2.3 square-mile (6.1 square-kilometer) wildfire and another fire nearby on Bureau of Land Management land that has burned nearly 17 square miles (44 square kilometers).",
      "More than 200 firefighters and support personnel worked to halt the uncontained fire Saturday as it burned across a high-altitude plateau between the communities of Lonesome, White Sage and Jacob Lake.",
      "In Colorado, Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park remains closed because of a 4.4-square-mile (11.3-square-kilometer) wildfire burning on the South Rim of the park, known for its dramatic, steep cliffs. A few miles from the fire, an evacuation was ordered for the community of Bostwick Park, and a nearby highway also was shut.",
      "The fires in and near both national parks led to evacuations of hundreds of people.",
      "Chirpich, the Minnesota resort owner, said he has plans to go to Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park on Thursday and is \u201ca bit pensive about how that's going to be there.\u201d",

      "The osprey is in decline in one of its key territories and some scientists blame overfishing of menhaden, an important food for the birds",
      "GLOUCESTER POINT, Va. -- Stepping onto an old wooden duck blind in the middle of the York River, Bryan Watts looks down at a circle of sticks and pine cones on the weathered, guano-spattered platform. It\u2019s a failed osprey nest, taken over by diving terns.",
      "\u201cThe birds never laid here this year,\u201d said Watts, near the mouth of Virginia\u2019s Chesapeake Bay. \u201cAnd that's a pattern we've been seeing these last couple of years.\u201d",
      "Watts has a more intimate relationship with ospreys than most people have with a bird \u2014 he has climbed to their nests to free them from plastic bags, fed them by hand and monitored their eggs with telescopic mirrors.",
      "The fish-eating raptor known for gymnastic dives and whistle-like chirps is an American conservation success story. After pesticides and other hazards nearly eliminated the species from much of the country, the hawk-like bird rebounded after the banning of DDT in 1972 and now numbers in the thousands in the U.S.",
      "But Watts has documented an alarming trend. The birds, which breed in many parts of the U.S., are failing to successfully fledge enough chicks around their key population center of the Chesapeake Bay. The longtime biologist blames the decline of menhaden, a small schooling fish critical to the osprey diet. Without menhaden to eat, chicks are starving and dying in nests, Watts said.",
      "Watts's claim has put him and environmental groups at odds with the fishing industry, trade unions and sometimes government regulators. Menhaden is valuable for fish oil, fish meal and agricultural food as well as bait.",
      "U.S. fishermen have caught at least 1.1 billion pounds of menhaden every year since 1951. Members of the industry tout its sustainability and said the decline in osprey may have nothing to do with fishing.",
      "But without help, the osprey population could tumble to levels not seen since the dark days of DDT, said Watts, director of the Center for Conservation Biology at The College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.",
      "\u201cThe osprey are yelling pretty loudly that, hey, there's not enough menhaden for us to reproduce successfully,\u201d Watts said. \u201cAnd we should be listening to them to be more informed fully on the fisheries side, and we should take precaution on the fisheries management side. But that hasn't won the day at this point.\u201d",
      "Watts, who has studied osprey on the Chesapeake for decades, has backed his claims of population decline by publishing studies in scientific journals. He said it boils down to a simple statistic \u2014 to maintain population, osprey pairs need to average 1.15 chicks per year.",
      "Osprey were reproducing at that level in the 1980s, but today in some areas around the main stem of the Chesapeake, it's less than half of that, Watts said. In particularly distressed areas, they aren't even reproducing at one-tenth that level, he said. And the decline in available menhaden matches the areas of nesting failure, Watts said.",
      "Also called pogies or bunkers, the oily menhaden are especially important for young birds because they are more nutritious than other fish in the sea. Osprey \u201creproductive performance is inextricably linked to the availability and abundance\u201d of menhaden, Watts wrote in a 2023 study published in Frontiers in Marine Science.",
      "Conservationists have been concerned for years, saying too many menhaden have been removed to maintain their crucial role in the ocean food chain. Historian H. Bruce Franklin went so far as to title his 2007 book on menhaden \u201cThe Most Important Fish In The Sea.\u201d",
      "Menhaden help sustain one of the world's largest fisheries, worth more than $200 million at the docks in 2023. Used as bait, the fish are critical for valuable commercial targets such as Maine lobster. They're also beloved by sportfishermen.",
      "The modern industry is dominated by Omega Protein, a Reedville, Virginia, company that is a subsidiary of Canadian aquaculture giant Cooke. The company pushed back at the idea that fishing is the cause of osprey decline, although it did acknowledge that fewer menhaden are showing up in some parts of the bay.",
      "Federal data show osprey breeding is in decline in many parts of the country, including where menhaden is not harvested at all, said Ben Landry, an Omega spokesperson. Climate change, pollution and development could be playing a role, said Landry and others with the company.",
      "Blaming fishing \u201cjust reeks of environmental special interest groups having an influence over the process,\u201d Landry said.",
      "The menhaden fishery is managed by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, an interstate body that crafts rules and sets fishing quotas. Prompted by questions about ospreys, it created a work group to address precautionary management of the species in the Chesapeake Bay.",
      "In April, this group proposed several potential management approaches, including seasonal closures, restrictions on quotas or days at sea, and limitations on kinds of fishing gear. The process of creating new rules could begin this summer, said James Boyle, fishery management plan coordinator with the commission.",
      "The osprey population has indeed shown declines in some areas since 2012, but it's important to remember the bird's population is much larger than it was before DDT was banned, Boyle said.",
      "\u201cThere are big increases in osprey population since the DDT era,\u201d Boyle said, citing federal data showing a six-fold increase in osprey populations along the Atlantic Coast since the 1960s.",
      "To a number of environmental groups, any decline is too much. This irritates some labor leaders who worry about losing more jobs as the fishing industry declines.",
      "Kenny Pinkard, retired vice president of UFCW Local 400's executive board and a longtime Virginia fishermen, said he feels the industry is being scapegoated.",
      "\u201cThere are some people who just don't want to see us in business at all,\u201d he said.",
      "But Chris Moore, Virginia executive director for Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said the country risks losing an iconic bird if no action is taken. He said Watts's studies show that the osprey will fail without access to menhaden.",
      "\u201cOsprey have been a success story,\u201d Moore said. \u201cWe're in a situation where they're not replacing their numbers. We'll actually be in a situation where we're in a steep decline.\u201d",

      "Federal regulators repeatedly granted appeals to remove Camp Mystic's buildings from their 100-year flood map, loosening oversight as the camp operated and expanded in a dangerous flood plain in the years before rushing waters swept away children and counselors, a review by The Associated Press found.",
      "The Federal Emergency Management Agency included the prestigious girls' summer camp in a \u201cSpecial Flood Hazard Area\u201d in its National Flood Insurance map for Kerr County in 2011, which means it was required to have flood insurance and faced tighter regulation on any future construction projects.",
      "That designation means an area is likely to be inundated during a 100-year flood \u2014 one severe enough that it only has a 1% chance of happening in any given year.",
      "Located in a low-lying area along the Guadalupe River in a region known as flash flood alley, Camp Mystic lost at least 27 campers and counselors and longtime owner Dick Eastland when historic floodwaters tore through its property before dawn on July 4.",
      "The flood was far more severe than the 100-year event envisioned by FEMA, experts said, and moved so quickly in the middle of the night that it caught many off guard in a county that lacked a warning system.",
      "But Syracuse University associate professor Sarah Pralle, who has extensively studied FEMA\u2019s flood map determinations, said it was \u201cparticularly disturbing\u201d that a camp in charge of the safety of so many young people would receive exemptions from basic flood regulation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a mystery to me why they weren\u2019t taking proactive steps to move structures away from the risk, let alone challenging what seems like a very reasonable map that shows these structures were in the 100-year flood zone,\u201d she said.",
      "Camp Mystic didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment and calls to it rang unanswered. The camp has called the flood an \u201cunimaginable tragedy\u201d and added in a statement Thursday that it had restored power for the purpose of communicating with its supporters.",
      "In response to an appeal, FEMA in 2013 amended the county's flood map to remove 15 of the camp\u2019s buildings from the hazard area. Records show that those buildings were part of the 99-year-old Camp Mystic Guadalupe, which was devastated by last week\u2019s flood.",
      "After further appeals, FEMA removed 15 more Camp Mystic structures in 2019 and 2020 from the designation. Those buildings were located on nearby Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, a sister site that opened to campers in 2020 as part of a major expansion and suffered less damage in the flood.",
      "Campers have said the cabins at Cypress Lake withstood significant damage, but those nicknamed \"the flats\u201d at the Guadalupe River camp were inundated.",
      "Experts say Camp Mystic's requests to amend the FEMA map could have been an attempt to avoid the requirement to carry flood insurance, to lower the camp\u2019s insurance premiums or to pave the way for renovating or adding new structures under less costly regulations.",
      "Pralle said the appeals were not surprising because communities and property owners have used them successfully to shield specific properties from regulation.",
      "Regardless of FEMA's determinations, the risk was obvious.",
      "At least 12 structures at Camp Mystic Guadalupe were fully within FEMA's 100-year flood plain, and a few more were partially in that zone, according to an AP analysis of data provided by First Street, a data science company that specializes in modeling climate risk.",
      "Jeremy Porter, the head of climate implications at First Street, said FEMA's flood insurance map underestimates flood risks. That's because it fails to take into account the effects of heavy precipitation on smaller waterways such as streams and creeks. First Street's model puts nearly all of Camp Mystic Guadalupe at risk during a 100-year flood.",
      "The buildings at the newer Cypress Lake site are farther from the south fork of the flood-prone river but adjacent to Cypress Creek. FEMA's flood plain doesn't consider the small waterway a risk.",
      "However, First Street\u2019s model, which takes into account heavy rain and runoff reaching the creek, shows that the majority of the Cypress Lake site lies within an area that has a 1% chance of flooding in any given year.",
      "In a statement, FEMA downplayed the significance of the flood map amendments.",
      "\u201cFlood maps are snapshots in time designed to show minimum standards for floodplain management and the highest risk areas for flood insurance,\u201d the agency wrote. \u201cThey are not predictions of where it will flood, and they don\u2019t show where it has flooded before.\u201d",
      "Property owners challenging FEMA's map designations hire engineers to conduct detailed studies to show where they believe the 100-year flood plain should actually be drawn. That is a \u201cpretty arduous process\u201d that can lead to more accurate maps while making it easier for future construction, said Chris Steubing, executive director of the Texas Floodplain Management Association, an industry group that represents floodplain managers.",
      "Pralle, who reviewed the amendments for AP, noted that some of the exempted properties were within 2 feet (0.6 meters) of FEMA's flood plain by the camp's revised calculations, which she said left almost no margin for error. She said her research shows that FEMA approves about 90% of map amendment requests, and the process may favor the wealthy and well-connected.",
      "A study she published in 2021 with researcher Devin Lea analyzed more than 20,000 buildings that had been removed from FEMA flood maps. It found that the amendments occurred more often in places where property values were higher, more white people lived and buildings were newer.",
      "FEMA had cautioned in its amendments that other parts of Camp Mystic remained on the flood map, and that \u201cany future construction or substantial improvement\u201d would be subject to flood plain management regulations.",
      "County officials not only allowed the camp to keep operating, but to dramatically expand.",
      "Considered Texas royalty after decades of taking care of the daughters of elite families, Camp Mystic owners Dick and Tweety Eastland cited the \u201ctremendous success\u201d of their original camp in explaining the need for a second site nearby.",
      "The expansion included new cabins and a dining hall, chapel, archery range and more. The camp had 557 campers and more than 100 staffers between its two locations when a state licensing agency conducted an inspection on July 2, two days before the tragedy, records show.",
      "FEMA referred questions about the expansion to local officials, who didn't reply to messages seeking comment.",
      "Steubing, a longtime municipal engineer in Texas, said the rain and flooding that hit Kerr County in a matter of hours were so much more intense than anything in its history that it's hard to call the flood plain management a failure.",
      "Local officials likely believed they were following existing regulations when they allowed the camp to keep growing, but \u201cthen Mother Nature set a new standard,\" he said.",
      "\u201cYou could have built things 2 feet (0.6 meters) higher, 3 feet (0.9 meters) higher, and they still might have gotten taken down,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency has spawned state-level DOGE initiatives as Republican governors and lawmakers aim to show that they're in step",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The brash and chaotic first days of President Donald Trump 's Department of Government Efficiency, once led by the world's richest man Elon Musk, spawned state-level DOGE mimicry as Republican governors and lawmakers aim to show they are in step with their party's leader.",
      "Governors have always made political hay out of slashing waste or taming bureaucracy, but DOGE has, in some ways, raised the stakes for them to show that they are zealously committed to cutting costs. Many drive home the point that they have always been focused on cutting government, even if they're not conducting mass layoffs.",
      "\u201cI like to say we were doing DOGE before DOGE was a thing,\u201d Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said in announcing her own task force in January.",
      "Critics agree that some of these initiatives are nothing new and suggest they are wasteful, essentially duplicating built-in processes that are normally the domain of legislative committees or independent state auditors.",
      "At the same time, some governors are using their DOGE vehicles to take aim at GOP targets of the moment, such as welfare programs or diversity, equity and inclusion programs. And some governors who might be eyeing a White House run in 2028 are rebranding their cost-cutting initiatives as DOGE, perhaps eager to claim the mantle of the most DOGE of them all.",
      "At least 26 states have initiated DOGE-style efforts of varying kinds, according to the Economic Policy Institute based in Washington, D.C.",
      "Most DOGE efforts were carried out through a governor\u2019s order \u2014 including by governors in Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, New Hampshire and Oklahoma \u2014 or by lawmakers introducing legislation or creating a legislative committee.",
      "The state initiatives have a markedly different character than Trump\u2019s slash-and-burn approach, symbolized by Musk\u2019s chainsaw-brandishing appearance at a Conservative Political Action Committee appearance in February.",
      "Governors are tending to entrust their DOGE bureaus to loyalists, rather than independent auditors, and are often employing what could be yearslong processes to consolidate procurement, modernize information technology systems, introduce AI tools, repeal regulations or reduce car fleets, office leases or worker headcounts through attrition.",
      "Steve Slivinski, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute who researches state government regulatory structures, said that a lot of what he has seen from state-level DOGE initiatives are the \u201csame stuff you do on a pretty regular basis anyway\u201d in state governments.",
      "States typically have routine auditing procedures and the ways states have of saving money are \u201crelatively unsexy,\" Slivinski said.",
      "And while the state-level DOGE vehicles might be useful over time in finding marginal improvements, \"branding it DOGE is more of a press op rather than anything new or substantially different than what they usually do,\u201d Slivinski said.",
      "Analysts at the pro-labor Economic Policy Institute say that governors and lawmakers, primarily in the South and Midwest, are using DOGE to breathe new life into long-term agendas to consolidate power away from state agencies and civil servants, dismantle public services and benefit insiders and privatization advocates.",
      "\u201cIt's not actually about cutting costs because of some fiscal responsibility,\u201d EPI analyst Nina Mast said.",
      "Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry rebranded his \u201cFiscal Responsibility Program\u201d as Louisiana DOGE, and promoted it as the first to team up with the federal government to scrub illegitimate enrollees from welfare programs. It has already netted $70 million in savings in the Medicaid program in an \u201cunprecedented\u201d coordination, Landry said in June.",
      "In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt \u2014 who says in a blurb on the Oklahoma DOGE website that \u201cI\u2019ve been DOGE-ing in Oklahoma since before it was cool\" \u2014 made a DOGE splash with the first report by his Division of Government Efficiency by declaring that the state would refuse some $157 million in federal public health grants.",
      "The biggest chunk of that was $132 million intended to support epidemiology and laboratory capacity to control infectious disease outbreaks.",
      "The Stitt administration said that funding \u2014 about one-third of the total over an eight-year period \u2014 exceeded the amount needed.",
      "The left-leaning Oklahoma Policy Institute questioned the wisdom of that, pointing to rising numbers of measles and whooping cough cases and the rocky transition under Stitt of the state's public health lab from Oklahoma City to Stillwater.",
      "Oklahoma Democrats issued rebukes, citing Oklahoma's lousy public health rankings.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t leadership,\u201d state Sen. Carri Hicks said. \u201dIt\u2019s negligence.\"",
      "Stitt's Oklahoma DOGE has otherwise recommended changes in federal law to save money, opened up the suggestion box to state employees and members of the general public and posted a spreadsheet online with cost savings initiatives in his administration.",
      "Those include things as mundane as agencies going paperless, refinancing bonds, buying automated lawn mowers for the Capitol grounds or eliminating a fax machine line in the State Board of Licensure for Professional Engineers and Surveyors.",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an executive order in February creating a task force of DOGE teams in each state agency.",
      "In the order, DeSantis recited 10 points on what he described as his and Florida\u2019s \u201chistory of prudent fiscal management\u201d even before DOGE.",
      "Among other things, DeSantis vowed to scrutinize spending by state universities and municipal and county governments \u2014 including on DEI initiatives \u2014 at a time when DeSantis is pushing to abolish the property taxes that predominantly fund local governments.",
      "His administration has since issued letters to universities and governments requesting reams of information and received a blessing from lawmakers, who passed legislation authorizing the inquiry and imposing fines for entities that don\u2019t respond.",
      "After the June 30 signing ceremony, DeSantis declared on social media: \u201cWe now have full authority to DOGE local governments.\u201d",
      "In Arkansas, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders launched her cost-cutting Arkansas Forward last year, before DOGE, and later said the state had done the \u201csame thing\u201d as DOGE.",
      "Her administration spent much of 2024 compiling a 97-page report that listed hundreds of ways to possibly save $300 million inside a $6.5 billion budget.",
      "Achieving that savings \u2014 largely by standardizing information technology and purchasing \u2014 would sometimes require up-front spending and take years to realize savings.",

      "Lahaina Street runs through the heart of Makaha, a neighborhood in a west Oahu community that's a lot like the Lahaina on Maui that burned down in a deadly wildfire in 2023",
      "WAIANAE, Hawaii -- When there's enough rain, the mountain-framed expanse of vacant land behind Calvin Endo's house looks like the lush and verdant landscape that makes tropical Hawaii famous. But in the summer, when the jungle of eyeball-high invasive grasses and spindly tree branches fade to brown, he fears it could become a fiery hellscape.",
      "This isn't Maui, where most of Lahaina burned down during a massive wildfire in August 2023. Endo\u2019s duplex is in Waianae on the west side of Oahu.",
      "But Waianae and Lahaina have a lot in common. They're both situated on parched western island coasts, with road access pinched by topography, and are bastions of Native Hawaiian culture. Both have sections crisscrossed by overhead power lines atop aging wooden poles, like those that fell in high winds and caused the Lahaina fire.",
      "There's even a Lahaina Street through the heart of Makaha, Endo's neighborhood along the Waianae coast.",
      "\u201cIt can happen to us,\u201d said Endo, who moved to the Makaha Meadows subdivision in 1980, soon after it was built. \u201cWe can have a repeat of Lahaina if somebody doesn\u2019t do anything about the brush in the back.\u201d",
      "In recent days, two wildfires a few miles away, including a July 6 blaze that left a 94-year-old woman dead, proved his worst fears could become reality.",
      "It's been nearly two years since Lahaina provided a worst-case scenario of the destruction from wind-whipped flames fueled by overgrown brush. With 102 deaths, it's the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century.",
      "In the months afterward, the number of Hawaii communities participating in the Firewise network, a nationally recognized program that helps communities with resources for safeguarding homes, more than doubled to 35 \u2014 but none in western Oahu.",
      "Even though Waianae residents have long known about their wildfire risks, only now is one of its neighborhoods close to gaining Firewise status.",
      "Communities become Firewise by organizing a committee, creating a hazard assessment, developing an action plan and volunteering hours toward reducing risk, such as removing overgrown brush. Firewise tracks a community\u2019s progress, connects residents with experts, and provides ideas and funding for mitigation, workshops and training.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service considers Lahaina and Waianae to be at much higher risk than other U.S. communities for a wildland fire, noted Honolulu Fire Department Battalion Chief Keith Ito.",
      "\u201cThe weather, the winds, they\u2019re pretty much identical,\u201d he said. \u201cWith all that being said, I think that the high-risk wildfire potential is a state-wide problem, not really specific to Waianae or Lahaina.\u201d",
      "Nani Barretto, co-director of the Hawaii Wildfire Management Organization, struggles to understand why fire-prone communities like Waianae have yet to join the Firewise movement. There are also no Firewise communities on the island of Kauai.",
      "\u201cJust because we are proactive in getting the word out, it doesn\u2019t mean the right people are getting the information,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Maui, it took a very devastating event for them to join.\u201d",
      "Organizing a community can be challenging because it requires residents to put in time and step up as leaders, she said.",
      "Endo, who is a longtime member of the Waianae Coast Neighborhood Board, had never even heard of Firewise until recently.",
      "A development called Sea Country, near the neighborhood that was recently ordered to evacuate during a wildfire, is close to becoming the fist Firewise community in Waianae, said Andria Tupola, a resident who also represents the coast on the Honolulu City Council.",
      "The process got underway around 2018 but picked up momentum after Lahaina, she said.",
      "Sea Country recently completed a hazard assessment and has planned some mitigation events, including a park cleanup in August, said Ashley Bare, the Firewise support specialist for Oahu.",
      "Lahaina also provided the spark for opening an emergency access route in Waianae, Tupola said. Farrington Highway, the main artery along the coast, can get clogged with just an accident.",
      "Military officials who control a mountain pass above Waianae started talking about letting civilians access the route after Lahaina, she said. During the July 6 fire, state and military officials were ready to open the road as a way out of the coast and into central Oahu, said state Rep. Darius Kila, who represents the area.",
      "A Hawaiian homestead community in Waianae's Nanakuli Valley is also trying to achieve Firewise status, said Diamond Badajos, spokesperson for the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands.",
      "Home to the largest concentration of Native Hawaiians, Waianae is rich in Hawaiian culture and history. But much of the coast also struggles with poverty and homelessness.",
      "Residents have grown accustomed to wildfires in the dry summer months, said Republican state Rep. Chris Muraoka: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like if it doesn\u2019t burn, something\u2019s not right.\u201d",
      "However, Muraoka said he thinks communities along the coast would benefit more from fire-prevention and safety education in schools rather than organizing to be Firewise. Muraoka, who lives in Makaha, said communities in Waianae have unique needs that being Firewise might not address, including sections with neighborhoods that are more spread out than in Lahaina and blazes that are often started by arsonists or kids playing with fire.",
      "Some residents already do what they can, especially with the dry season underway.",
      "Endo often tries to clear brush on private property behind his home himself, to create a firebreak. Some properties in Waianae Valley use sheep to eat the overgrown vegetation.",
      "Retired firefighter Shermaih \u201cBulla\u201d Iaea recalls fighting blazes in the brush near Endo\u2019s home and Makaha Elementary School.",
      "In 2018, his farm burned down during high winds from a passing hurricane. He was using a herd of sheep on his property until wild dogs killed them in April. Neighborhoods banding together to become Firewise is another tool that will help, he said.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a 100 percent chance that will happen here,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it would never happen to me. Now I\u2019m trying to ring the bells. I\u2019m trying to sound the alarm.\u201d",
      "Being one of the poorest communities in the state is a major factor preventing Waianae from becoming Firewise, said Kila, who lives near where the July 6 fire happened.",
      "Before the summer, the Democratic lawmaker sent a letter to Hawaiian Electric and telecom companies urging \u201cimmediate and coordinated action\" to address dangerous, sagging utility lines on aging wooden poles along the coast.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why Makaha ended up with a long street named Lahaina, which can mean \u201crelentless sun\u201d in Hawaiian. But like the west Maui town, it fits the sunny west Oahu neighborhood, which is home to the world-famous Makaha surfing beach.",
      "Some neighborhoods above Lahaina Street are newer and have underground utilities, like Endo's. But toward the ocean, older neighborhoods are laced by overhead power lines.",
      "That worries Glen Kila, a Hawaiian cultural practitioner in Waianae, who is not related to Darius Kila. Power lines are blamed for sparking the Lahaina blaze.",
      "\u201cIf that happens to Waianae,\" he said, \"we\u2019re done.\u201d",

      "A Colorado dentist is set to go on trial next week, accused of killing his wife by poisoning her protein shakes",
      "DENVER -- Just days before she died after suffering symptoms that mystified her doctors, Angela Craig confronted her husband, James, in their suburban Denver kitchen over his lack of support.",
      "In that 2023 argument captured on home surveillance video, she accused him of suggesting to hospital staff that she was suicidal, court documents show.",
      "Prosecutors say James Craig caused the ailments that ultimately killed his wife by poisoning her protein shakes and trying to make it look as if she killed herself. His trial on murder and other charges is set to begin Monday with the questioning of potential jurors.",
      "Angela Craig, 43, died in March 2023 during her third trip to the hospital that month. Toxicology tests later determined she died of poisoning from cyanide and tetrahydrozoline, an ingredient that is found in over-the-counter eye drops.",
      "The couple were married 23 years and had six children.",
      "Craig has pleaded not guilty to charges including first-degree murder, solicitation to commit murder and solicitation to commit perjury.",
      "The 47-year-old dentist allegedly bought arsenic online around the time his wife began to experience symptoms like dizziness and headaches for which doctors could find no cause, prosecutors say.",
      "At the time of his arrest, police said Craig was trying to start a new life amid financial troubles and appeared to be having an affair with a fellow dentist. Prosecutors said he had affairs with two other women, but they have not detailed a motive in his wife's death.",
      "Craig's attorneys have argued police were biased against him and claimed testing of his wife's shake containers did not turn up signs of poison. They've questioned the reliability of a jail inmate who said Craig offered him $20,000 to kill the case's lead investigator, an alleged plot for which Craig is also on trial.",
      "To avoid being held accountable, prosecutors said, Craig tried to fabricate evidence to make it appear his wife killed herself.",
      "He tried to get another fellow inmate to plant fraudulent letters at Craig's home to make it look like his wife was suicidal, prosecutors said. Then, in the weeks before Craig had been set to stand trial in November, prosecutors said he also sent letters to the ex-wife of the inmate he allegedly tried to get to kill the investigator, offering her $20,000 for each person she could find to falsely testify that his wife planned to die by suicide, they said.",
      "As jury selection was about to begin, his lawyer at the time, Harvey Steinberg, asked to withdraw, citing a rule allowing lawyers to step down if a client persists in actions considered criminal or that they disagree with.",
      "Another attorney for Craig, Robert Werking, later argued that investigators did not look into whether Craig wrote the letters or check them against his handwriting. Werking also said that the inmate and his ex-wife were prosecuted for forgery for their roles in an alleged fraud ring in 2005, suggesting they could not be trusted.",
      "Werking withdrew from the case himself this month after being charged with arson of his own home, leaving his wife and law partner, Lisa Fine Moses, to defend Craig. Werking's attorney, David Beller, said he was getting mental health treatment and asked the public to show him grace.",
      "Moses did not immediately return telephone and email messages seeking comment.",
      "Over the objections of the defense, prosecutors plan to show the video of the argument in the kitchen to jurors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s your fault they treated me like I was a suicide risk, like I did it to myself, and like nothing I said could be believed,\u201d Angela Craig told her husband after her first trip to the hospital.",
      "Prosecutors convinced the judge jurors should see the video because they said it disproves potential claims that Angela Craig poisoned herself \u2014 possibly while trying to dissuade him from divorcing her \u2014 or to frame him and gain an advantage over him if they did divorce.",
      "\u201cHer mental state is anger and frustration, not suicidality or desperation to keep the defendant in the marriage,\u201d Senior Chief Deputy District Attorney Michael Mauro wrote in a recent court filing.",
      "One of Angela Craig's siblings, Mark Pray, said last year that James Craig not only orchestrated the \u201ctorment and demise\u201d of his sister but had shown disregard for others, including their children.",
      "Prosecutors say James Craig searched online for answers to questions such as \u201chow to make murder look like a heart attack\" and \u201cis arsenic detectable in an autopsy?\u201d",
      "After Craig\u2019s initial attempts to kill his wife failed, prosecutors allege, he ordered a rush shipment of potassium cyanide, supposedly for surgery. The shipment was accidentally discovered by an employee at his dental practice in the Denver suburb of Aurora on March 13, 2023. The employee reported it to the office manager two days later when Angela Craig returned to the hospital for a third and final time.",
      "Craig\u2019s business partner, Ryan Redfearn, told a nurse treating Angela Craig that he was concerned she could have been poisoned with the cyanide. The nurse reported that to police, who began their investigation the same day.",
      "Angela Craig died days later.",

      "In southern Arizona on Tuesday, Foxx is one of several Democrats hoping to step into a deep blue seat left vacant by the death of Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva, a longtime political power broker in Tucson. He had become one of the most senior lawmakers on Capitol Hill over two decades in Congress. Grijalva's daughter, Adelita, is one of the contenders, and three Republicans are vying in the GOP primary.",
      "But the push for younger leaders won\u2019t end there. In next year\u2019s midterm elections, primary challengers have already begun to emerge in states like California and Indiana that will give Democratic voters choices between longtime lawmakers and younger candidates.",
      "In Georgia, for example, 80-year-old Democratic Rep. David Scott\u2019s decades-long legacy could end with a primary he\u2019s expected to join. This has drawn challengers fed up with his refusal to step aside despite years of concern about his declining health and rare public appearances.

      "Blair agreed that Democrats have better policy prescriptions for addressing voters\u2019 economic concerns, but he said too many longtime lawmakers have stifled the party\u2019s ability to get that message across.

A large Texas flag stood on one end of the memorial, flapping in the breeze.",
      "Debi Leos, who grew up in the Hill Country town of Junction, said she stopped by the memorial to leave flowers in honor of Richard \u201cDick\u201d Eastland, the beloved director of Camp Mystic who died trying to save some of the young girls at his camp.",
      "\u201cHill Country is near and dear to me, and we came down here to pay our respects,\u201d Leos said. \u201cAs a parent, I can only imagine what the families are going through.\u201d",
      "Friday evening, about 300 people showed up at the memorial for a vigil with speakers that included faith leaders and some who told harrowing tales of narrowly escaping the flood.",
      "Michelle McGuire said she woke up July 4 at her apartment in Hunt, Texas, to find her bed and nightstand floating and quickly found herself in deep flood waters, clinging to a tree for life.",
      "\u201cThank God I'm a good swimmer,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn't want my mom to have to bury me.\u201d",
      "Marc Steele, bishop-elect of the Anglican Diocese of the Living Word, said the memorial has become a place where people of all different faiths and backgrounds can come together and share their grief.",
      "\u201cWe like to take opportunities like this to come together and pray to God,\u201d Steele said, \u201cand also Sunday mornings we come together and worship in prayer for our sorrow and thanksgiving for lives that were saved.\u201d",

      "HAVANA -- The United States government announced Friday it was sanctioning Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel and other top officials for human rights violations and restricting access to visas on the anniversary of the biggest protests on the island in recent decades.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on social media platform X that the State Department also would impose visa restrictions on Cuban judicial and prison officials \u201cresponsible for, or complicit in, the unjust detention and torture of the July 2021 protesters.\u201d",
      "The protests, which were not led by an opposition group, developed July 11 and 12, 2021, drawing attention to the depths of Cuba\u2019s economic crisis.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will continue to stand for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of Cuba, and make clear no illegitimate, dictatorial regimes are welcome in our hemisphere,\u201d Rubio said in the statement.",
      "The Trump administration has taken a harder line against Cuba's government than the Biden administration.",
      "In addition to D\u00edaz-Canel, the U.S. sanctioned Cuban Defense Minister \u00c1lvaro L\u00f3pez Miera and Interior Minister L\u00e1zaro \u00c1lvarez Casas.",
      "Shortly after the announcement, Johana Tablada, deputy director of the U.S. department in the Cuban Foreign Ministry, lashed out at Rubio, calling him a \u201cdefender of genocide, prisons and mass deportations.\u201d",
      "The rare protests in 2021 came about after repeated blackouts in Havana and other cities. One man died and some marches ended in vandalism.",
      "Groups supporting the government responded along with authorities to repress the protests. Human rights groups estimated there were more than 1,000 arrests but the government gave no official figures.",
      "At the time, the Cuban government said it was the result of a U.S. media campaign and decades of U.S. sanctions.",
      "In 2022, Cuban prosecutors said some 790 people were investigated for acts related to the protests ranging from disorder to sabotage and vandalism.",
      "The advocacy group 11J, whose name alludes to the protests, said late last year there were 554 people serving sentences related to the protests, but some were given conditional release in January after an appeal from Pope Francis.",

      "Gergen worked in the administrations of Presidents Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton. Over the years, he served as a speechwriter, communications director and counselor to the president, among other roles.",
      "Dean Jeremy Weinstein of the Harvard Kennedy School, with which Gergen had a long relationship, said Gergen died of a long illness. Gergen \u201cdevoted decades of his life to serving those who sought to serve,\u201d said Hannah Riley Bowles, a former co-director of the school's Center for Public Leadership, where Gergen was the founding director.",

      "Al Gore, who served as Clinton's vice president, posted on X, \u201cOf the countless ways that David Gergen contributed to our great country, what I will remember him for most was his kindness to everyone he worked with, his sound judgment, and his devotion to doing good in the world.\u201d",
      "David Richmond Gergen was born in North Carolina and graduated from Yale University and the Harvard Law School, according to a biography on the Harvard Kennedy School website. He would go on to receive 27 honorary degrees over the course of his career.",

      "After serving in the U.S. Navy in the 1960s, Gergen took his first White House job in 1971, serving as a speechwriting assistant for Nixon. Bipartisanship and collaboration were hallmarks of his long career, said colleagues who paid testimonials on social media Friday.",
      "He was also a media personality who worked as a senior political analyst for CNN.

    "summary": "You may not know his name, but there's a good chance you've seen Richard Kind \u2013 acting on TV, in films, on Broadway, or as the announcer-sidekick of \"Everybody's Live with John Mulaney\" \u2013 and he's fine making everyone else look good.",
    "story": [
      "If you turn on a TV or sit in a movie theater, it's likely you'll see one particular actor \u2026 and there's also a good chance you won't know his name: \"I'm walking from the subway to the theater and a woman \u2013 I was in Times Square, so she's obviously a tourist \u2013 she goes, 'Oh, my God, there's, hey, hey, hey, hey\u2026' Didn't even know the name!\"",
      "His name is Richard Kind, and he's quite happy being just a little famous.",
      "\"I'll walk down the street and somebody will go, 'Oh, you're a national treasure.' And then I pass 250 people who don't know who I am, and yet that person thinks I'm a national treasure!\" he said.",
      "National treasure Richard Kind has made a lot of people laugh, and sometimes, nap. I asked, \"When you're on the stage, do you ever look down and see somebody asleep?\"",
      "\"Sure!\"",
      "\"What's that feel like?\"",
      "\"I say, I don't blame you!\" he laughed.",
      "Over the years, Kind has shown up everywhere. Maybe you've seen him on \"Poker Face,\" or \"Mid-Century Modern,\" or \"Only Murders in the Building.\" He's also the announcer and sidekick on the Netflix talk show \"Everybody's Live with John Mulaney.\"",
      "For 45 years, he's worked on Broadway (earning a Tony nomination for \"The Big Knife\"), and in movies and television, to become a respected actor. But that wasn't always his goal. \"When I was young, lying in bed, dreaming of stardom, I wanted stardom,\" he said. \"I didn't wanna be a good actor; I wanted stardom.\"",
      "Kind thought he'd follow his father into his Princeton, N.J., jewelry business. \"That I'm an actor is so wrong,\" he said. \"I should have gone into my dad's store. I should be in business. I should have been a lawyer. I should have done what is expected of a suburban middle-class kid.\"",
      "He said growing up he was teased more than most: \"I was a fat kid. I bet I was a loser. I'd might have made fun of me!\"",
      "But at summer camp, a friend gave him what became an essential life lesson: \"He taught me how to laugh at myself,\" Kind said.",
      "\"Was that laugh-at-yourself-before-other-people-do a defense mechanism?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes, absolutely. Absolutely, absolutely. He was a fat kid, too, who then lost weight. I eventually lost weight. Still a fat kid even to this day. I'll never be a thin person\u2026. In my head, I'm a fat, fat person.\"",
      "In the 1970s, self-assurance developed on stage at Northwestern University, and at Chicago's legendary improv theater, the Second City. \"Six nights a week at Second City, that is my Harvard of acting,\" Kind said. \"Some people would say it's the Harvard of comedy. It's not. It was my Harvard of acting.\"",
      "Even with that on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9, there were still doubts: \"My dad used to ask my professors at school or my directors, and these were his exact words: 'Does he have it? Is he any good?' He would not trust himself to say, 'Oh, my son is a good actor.' He would ask somebody else, 'Is he a good actor?' What the hell? Look at me, I'm a good actor!\"",
      "Possibly his most memorable role to date: Bing Bong, an imaginary creature who ultimately sacrifices himself to save his young friend, Riley/Joy, in the Pixar film \"Inside Out.\" \"I died for her,\" Kind said. \"I died so that she might have a great life.\"",
      "According to John Mulaney, that moment \u2013 letting let go of the past, but remaining child-like \u2013 says a lot about Richard Kind. \"In many ways, by having him as our announcer, we've given our imaginary friend a place at a podium,\" Mulaney said. \"He's incredibly sweet, incredibly childlike, and a real man and a powerful actor, and a great father.\"",
      "And here's another of his many roles you may have missed: the science fiction comedy \"Sharknado 2: The Second One,\" in which tornadoes hurl sharks at New York City \u2013 and New York City doesn't take it lying down. \"I hit a shark out of the ballpark. Now that's something I don't think a lot of people have that on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s. I do!\"",
      "It seems like almost every place you go, you'll bump into Kind. Here we are at a recent New York Mets charity poker event. \"I used to be very good at this,\" he said. \"Then, I had children and moved to New York. Children can ruin a poker game \u2026 Every time I bet, I'm like this, thinking, Well, how will I pay for my kids' college?\"",
      "In some ways, Kind's success is all about the risks he's taken. \"This business is very cruel to actors,\" he said. \"Truly, it's very cruel. Some people call it insulting. I don't call it insulting, but I do say it is cruel. How much did I make my first episode of 'Curb Your Enthusiasm'? How much did I make?\"",
      "\"Not a clue,\" I said.",
      "\"Take a guess.\"",
      "\"First episode? $2,500?\"",
      "\"That's a good guess. $700!\" Kind said. \"You go in with the attitude that everybody who's casting this product wants to make 'Seinfeld money.' They wanna make a lot of money. I walk in saying, 'I can help you make this great. I am the right guy for this.'\"",
      "And with a flourishing career built on being exactly the right guy, Richard Kind is grateful just to be at the same table with other actors. \"I am parsley on a plate of meat and potatoes,\" he said. \"Now, I'm good. I look great there. I'm the freshest parsley! But they're meat and potatoes. What do I do? I help make the plate look great. That's fine. That's what I usually do. But I can be cut out. I'm just not necessary all the time. And I'm fine, fine, fine with that. I've made a career of it, haven't I?\"",

    "story": [
      "Here's a family puzzle: How do you showcase your grandfather's career in honor of his passing two years ago, a career that spans more than five decades?",
      "For co-curator and granddaughter Isca Greenfield-Sanders, a retrospective now on display in Manhattan is a chance for the world to brush up on \"Joop Sanders: The Last Abstract Expressionist.\" The exhibit at the Milton Resnick and Pat Passlof Foundation runs until July 19.",
      "\"We could've done this show with 15 entirely different paintings,\" said Greenfield-Sanders. \"But we had favorites and we had must-haves.",
      "\"Abstract Expressionism is the first movement tracthat is homegrown in the United States that is an international art movement,\" she said. \"You look at a lot of the geometric work, it's quite figurative. It's very human. It teaches you about how you are holding yourself in space and how you are looking at it on the wall.\"",
      "Joop Sanders emigrated from Amsterdam to the U.S. at age 17. He was among the youngest to take part in the landmark 9th Street Show in 1951, sharing the same billing with more familiar names like Willem and Elaine de Kooning, who would become lifelong friends. Elaine and Joop even posed for each other back when they couldn't afford models.",
      "\"He was always in there and always making great work,\" said Greenfield-Sanders. \"I think often about what it must have been like keeping up with these guys who had been painting for quite a while already, and holding his own.\"",
      "But during that scene's formative years in the mid- to late-1950s, Sanders and his new family left for his native Holland, exhibiting all over Europe, before coming back to New York. It was when Abstract Expressionism was hot.",
      "\"A handful of the Ab Ex painters made money, and the truth is no one else did,\" said Greenfield-Sanders. \"He's still living his life as a human being, and he has a young family and his parents want to know their grandchildren. His family was very important to him.\"",
      "And important for Greenfield-Sanders, who learned how to paint from Grandpa Joop at eight years old. The exhibit is part of a grieving process to honor the artist who died in 2023.",
      "Of Joop Sanders' \"Dream of the Red Chamber,\" I asked, \"Can you imagine not having this in your life?\"",
      "\"No,\" Greenfield-Sanders replied. \"I always think of it as the red painting, but there are so many other colors. As a painter, I see some of his moves. They're so much movement \u2013 it's a dance.\"",
      "Joop Sanders died just short of his 102nd birthday. \"I was born on his 57th birthday, and he and I shared a birthday for the next 44 years,\" Greenfield-Sanders said.",
      "His loss from the family has been lifted by being able to bring to light all of his paintings and share them with other people.",

In recent days, O'Donnell on social media denounced Mr. Trump and recent moves by his administration, including the signing of a massive GOP-backed tax breaks and spending cuts plan.",

      "Comedian and actor Patton Oswalt is recording his audio-only special \"Black Coffee and Ice Water\" in New York City this weekend that will be released later this year.",
      "\"It's a combination of experience my sadness and experience my confusion,\" the Emmy winner told \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "\"The times are so rapidly insane right now that there are times as a comedian when you're like, this insane story that I'm going to tell in a month is not going to seem insane anymore based on what people are going through.\"",
      "Part of the project involves life with a teenager, Oswalt said while talking about his own experiences, \"you really get to see, 'oh \u2026 that's the way that I used to be. Oh she either got that from me or some of this is in-born. How can I change this? How do we make this better?'\"",
      "Oswalt recalled how his daughter has reacted to his work, saying it's primarily positive.",
      "\"The only reaction that I've ever gotten that was negative and it wasn't even negative, she just said, 'You got one little fact wrong here. If you could change this' \u2014 and she wasn't even for embarrassment's sake,\" he said.",
      "The former \"Parks & Recreation\" actor said he enjoys spending time with his daughter, but added laughingly, \"I don't have the teenager that doesn't want to hang out with me. She actually digs hanging out with me and my wife, but we do have a teenager who's always slightly disappointed in us.\"",
      "For Oswalt, the family moments are full circle, \"we're hanging out and we're having fun and then daddy realizes what a goofball he is or I'm realizing, oh, wait a minute \u2026 I would get just as embarrassed by my dad at this. That's what she's doing right now.\"",
      "When asked why he wanted to do an Audible for \"Black Coffee and Ice Water\" instead of on a streaming platform, Oswalt said the reason centers around nostalgia.",
      "\"I miss the times when comedians would put out an album. All of my specials, I'm doing a thing now where I'm going back I'm putting them out on vinyl,\" he said. \"It's about ego \u2026 there's just less physical media being made.\"",
      "\"Black Coffee and Ice Water\" will be out Nov. 20 on Audible.",

      "The original Herm\u00e8s Birkin bag was built specifically for Jane Birkin after a chance meeting in 1984. While on an Air France flight, Birkin complained to then-Herm\u00e8s leader Jean-Louis Dumas that she couldn't find a purse big enough to hold everything she carried daily, Sotheby's said. She was a young mother and couldn't find a bag that fit her needs, according to Herm\u00e8s.",

    "story": [
      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is as difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service, called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",

      "In his letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the country has helped stem the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into the U.S. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a \"Narco-Trafficking Playground.\"",
      "\"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "The Mexican economy and foreign ministries, in a joint statement on Saturday, said they had been informed of the new tariffs during a meeting in Washington, D.C. on Friday.",
      "\"We mentioned at the table that it was an unfair deal and that we did not agree,\" the statement said.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's announcement, Sheinbaum asserted that the sovereignty of the Mexican people is non-negotiable, saying the tariff is \"for all the countries in the world, each one of them is being sent a letter.\"",
      "The Mexican president said the two countries are \"seeking to reach an agreement so that these tariffs do not exist.\"",
      "In his letter to the European Union, Mr. Trump said the relationship between the bloc and the U.S. has been \"far from Reciprocal,\" and that the U.S. trade deficit was a national security threat.",
      "\"We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and have concluded that we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump is in an announcement blitz of new tariffs with allies and foes alike, a bedrock of his 2024 campaign that he said would set the foundation for reviving a U.S. economy that he claims has been ripped off by other nations for decades.",
      "With the reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump is effectively blowing up the rules governing world trade. For decades, the U.S. and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay Round. Countries could set their own tariffs \u2013 but under the \"most favored nation'' approach, they couldn't charge one country more than they charged another.",
      "\"Our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners,\"\u00a0White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0\"And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.\"",
      "The European Union's chief trade negotiator said earlier this week that a trade deal to avert higher tariffs on European goods imported to the U.S. could be reached \"even in the coming days.\" Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France on Wednesday that the EU had been spared the increased tariffs contained in the letters Mr. Trump sent on Monday, and that an extension of talks would provide \"additional space to reach a satisfactory conclusion.\"",
      "The bloc collectively sells more to the U.S. than any other country. U.S. goods imports from the EU topped $553 billion in 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, acknowledged Mr. Trump's letter and said in a statement on Saturday that imposing the tariffs on EU exports would \"disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.\"",
      "\"Few economies in the world match the European Union's level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices. The EU has consistently prioritized a negotiated solution with the U.S., reflecting our commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership,\" she added. \"We remain ready to continue working towards an agreement by August 1. At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required.\"",
      "Steeper tariffs\u00a0that Mr. Trump announced on April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the\u00a0financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect, but he kept the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs. The freeze expired on Wednesday.",
      "With Saturday's letters, Mr. Trump has now issued tariff conditions on 24 countries and the 27-member European Union.",

    "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 09:07:17 -0400",
    "summary": "New law reduces the number of federal student loan repayment options and caps how much individuals can borrow for higher education.",
    "story": [
      "The millions of Americans with student loans, who have already experienced whiplash in federal policy since the pandemic, must again brace for change.",
      "The \"big, beautiful bill\" that President Trump signed into law on July 4 overhauls the federal student loan system by reducing the number of repayment plan options down to two from seven and capping the amount individuals can borrow for higher education.",
      "Here's how the new budget law will affect people with federal student loans.",
      "Repayment plan options",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act phases out a number of existing federal student loan repayment plans, including the SAVE, PAYE, IBR and ICR.",
      "Current borrowers enrolled in programs to be eliminated will have until July 1, 2028, to switch to a new plan. For the 7.7 million Americans enrolled in the Biden-era SAVE plan, interest collection will resume on Aug. 1, the Department of Education\u00a0announced\u00a0Wednesday.",
      "Beginning on July 1, 2026, new student loan borrowers will choose between one of two plans: a standard repayment plan or an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan called the Repayment Assistance Plan. The standard repayment plan will allow student loan borrowers to make fixed payments over the course of 10 to 25 years.",
      "That approach \"condenses a maze of loan options into two,\" simplifying the repayment process, according to the White House.",
      "The Repayment Assistance Plan will allow borrowers to pay 1% to 10% of their income on a monthly basis, for up to 30 years, Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at advocacy group Student Borrower Protection Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. That's a longer timeline than current IDR plans, which\u00a0are currently either 20 or 25 years.",
      "After the 30-year mark, the borrower's remaining loan balance will be canceled, as is currently the case after an individual's repayment window ends.",
      "The five-year payment extension on income-based payments concerns Ba\u00f1ez, who said \"borrowers are going to be forced to be in repayment for even longer,\" she said.",
      "However, Sarah Reber, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, thinks the binary repayment options a \"huge improvement\" from a policy design perspective. The current system is confusing for borrowers given all the options from which they have to choose, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The One Big Beautiful Bill gives families the freedom to choose the best education for their children while reforming a broken federal loan system to promote responsibility, affordability and opportunity,\" the White House said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Pell Grants",
      "The new law tightens eligibility rules for the Pell Grant program, the largest source of federal aid for low-income students. From 2021-2022, an estimated 92% of Pell Grant recipients had a total family income at or below $60,000,\u00a0according to Congress.gov.",
      "Under the law, students who receive a full scholarship from a college or university will no longer be eligible for additional funding through the Pell Grant program.",
      "By contrast, the law expands Pell Grant eligibility for students in workforce training programs. Previously, Pell Grants could only be used to pay for workforce training courses of less than 600 hours and 15 weeks, shutting out many short-term programs.",
      "That will enable \"Pell Grants to be used for short-term, high-quality workforce training programs to support Americans who choose a career or technical education path for career advancement,\" the White House said.",
      "The budget law also increases scrutiny of the Student Aid Index, which is used to determine the size of an individual's federal aid eligibility. As a result, higher-income families will have a harder time getting Pell Grant funding, according to the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP).",
      "Borrowing caps",
      "The new law sets borrowing caps on certain loans beginning July 1, 2026.",
      "Parent PLUS loans \u2014 federal loans available for parents of dependent undergraduate students \u2014 will now be restricted to $20,000 a year and a total cap of $65,000. That's a change from the current limit, which amounts to the total cost of attendance minus any student aid an individual receives.",
      "The new law also does away with\u00a0Grad PLUS loans,\u00a0which help people finance higher education degrees. Starting July 1, 2026, new students will no longer be able to apply for the loans. However, current borrowers will be grandfathered and still allowed to access the loans, according to EdSource.",
      "With the elimination of Grad PLUS loans, graduate students in need of federal tuition assistance will have to take out Direct Unsubsidized Loans. Those seeking unsubsidized federal loans for professional degrees, such as law or medicine, will be restricted to $50,000 per year and a $200,000 lifetime cap. Those seeking advanced degrees in nonprofessional areas, such as history or philosophy, will be subject to an annual borrowing cap of $20,500 and a lifetime limit of $100,000.",
      "Economic hardship, unemployment deferment",
      "Currently, student loan borrowers can apply for up to three years of deferment based on economic hardship or unemployment, according to the Federal Student Aid website.",
      "Starting July 1, 2026, the new law eliminates deferment provisions for borrowers facing economic hardship. For example, someone who falls behind on the bills because of job loss would no longer qualify to defer student loan payments, Ba\u00f1ez said.",
      "According to the White House, the changes to the deferment rules will streamline the process while also better protecting students and taxpayers.",

    "story": [
      "A top Trump administration official accused Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of leading an \"ostentatious\" office renovation project that may be \"violating the law\" on Thursday, a new broadside against the central bank chief as President Trump tangles with him over interest rates.",
      "\"The President is extremely troubled by your management of the Federal Reserve System,\" Office of Management and Budget Chair Russell Vought wrote in a letter Thursday.",
      "The letter came after months of criticism from Mr. Trump over the Fed's decision not to slash interest rates. Economists say lowering rates may accelerate economic growth, but also runs the risk of causing inflation to spike. That has led the Fed's interest rate-setting committee \u2014 which Powell chairs \u2014 to keep rates steady so far this year after cutting rates slightly last year.",
      "Mr. Trump has called on Powell to resign from his post, and last month, the president called Powell a \"numbskull\" over his interest rate decisions and said \"maybe\" he'll try to fire Powell \u2014 though federal law states the Fed chair can only be fired \"for cause,\" which typically refers to firings due to specific misconduct or performance issues. In the past, Mr. Trump had said he doesn't plan on trying to fire Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends next year.",
      "Vought's letter took aim at Powell and the central bank over its years-long office renovation project in Washington, D.C. The letter said plans for the project \"called for rooftop terrace gardens, VIP private dining rooms and elevators, water features, premium marble, and much more.\" Vought also asked whether the Fed has made changes to its plans without seeking approval from a government commission that oversees D.C.-area federal building projects.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Federal Reserve for comment.",
      "In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project \"misleading and inaccurate.\" He told lawmakers there isn't any new marble aside from what's necessary to replace broken old marble, and said there are no \"special elevators,\" new water features or rooftop gardens.",
      "\"All of the sort of inflammatory things that the media carried are either not in the current plan or just inaccurate,\" Powell said.",
      "Vought's letter argued that comment to the Senate \"appears to reveal that the project is out of compliance with the approved plan,\" suggesting the Fed may have run afoul of a law requiring D.C.-area projects be approved by the National Capital Planning Commission. In a post on X, the Office of Management and Budget alleged Powell \"slipped up and revealed he might...be violating the law.\" The Fed's renovation plans were reviewed by the commission several years ago.",
      "The Fed typically operates with a much higher degree of independence than most other government institutions. Federal law gives the Fed the power to make decisions about acquiring and remodeling buildings in Washington to serve as its office spaces.",
      "The Fed has previously acknowledged\u00a0that the price tag for its office renovations had jumped due to \"significant increases in raw materials costs,\" along with higher labor costs.",
      "On its website, the Fed says the two headquarters buildings that are getting overhauled \"have not been comprehensively renovated since their construction in the 1930s.\" The central bank said there are no private elevators or new VIP dining rooms \u2014 instead, the project will refurbish old elevators and conference rooms, including ones that are sometimes \"used for mealtime meetings.\" It also said plans for new water features were scrapped, though existing fountains will be repaired, and the garden terrace is actually a \"ground-level front lawn.\"",
      "Last week, Bill Pulte, the Trump-nominated head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, accused Powell of \"deceptive\" testimony to the Senate about the office project.",
      "Asked about the allegation in a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Mr. Trump said: \"Then he should resign immediately. We should get somebody in it that's going to lower interest rates.\"",

      "Lula said he would trigger Brazil's reciprocity law approved by Congress earlier this year if negotiations with the U.S. fail.",
      "\"If there's no negotiation, the reciprocity law will be put to work. If he charges 50 (% tariffs) from us, we will charge 50 from them,\" Lula told TV Record in excerpts of an interview that will be fully aired later in the day. \"Respect is good. I like to offer mine and I like to receive it.\"",
      "Lula's comments raise the risk of a tariffs war erupting between the two countries, similar to what has happened between the U.S. and China. Trump has vowed to respond forcefully if countries seek to punish the U.S. by adding tariffs of their own.",
      "The president of Brazil's Senate, Sen. Davi Alcolumbre, and Chamber of Deputies Speaker Hugo Motta, a pair of moderates who have recently been at odds with Lula, agreed that the recipricity law gives Brazil \"the means ... to protect our sovereignty.\"",
      "\"We will be ready to act with balance and firmness in defense of our economy, our productive sector, and the protection of Brazilian jobs,\" they said in a joint statement.",
      "The tariffs letter that Trump sent to Brazil \u2014 and posted on social media Wednesday \u2014 railing against the \"witch hunt\" trial against Bolsonaro opened up a new front in his trade wars, with the U.S. leader directly using import taxes to interfere with another nation's domestic politics.",
      "Trump has already tried to use tariffs to ostensibly combat fentanyl trafficking and as a negotiating tool to change how other nations tax digital services and regulate their economies.",
      "In Brazil's case, Trump is trying to dictate the outcome of the criminal trial of Bolsonaro, an ally who like Trump has been charged with attempting to overturn a presidential election. Bolsonaro maintains that he is being politically persecuted by Brazil's Supreme Court over his charges on the alleged plot to remain in power after his 2022 election loss to Lula.",
      "\"There's nothing Lula or Brazil can do about Bolsonaro's trial,\" said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. \"Any change in that would be Brazil's capitulation. Bolsonaro's situation here won't change. How do you negotiate over that?\"",
      "Lula ordered his diplomats on Thursday to return Trump's letter if it physically arrives at the presidential palace in Brasilia. The document attacks the country's judiciary and mentions recent rulings on social media companies among the reasons why goods from the South American nation will have higher tariffs from Aug. 1.",
      "Trump has initiated his tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act, saying in April that the persistent deficit between what the U.S. exports and what it imports is a national crisis.",
      "But the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, undermining some of the rationale.",
      "A staffer of Brazil's foreign ministry told The Associated Press that trade negotiations that were ongoing since Trump imposed a first set of tariffs in April are now \"up in the air.\"",
      "Some members of the Lula administration say Trump's move is actually aimed at Brazil's connection with other Southern economies, as displayed on Sunday at the summit of BRICS nations hosted in Rio de Janeiro. Brazil's president once again mentioned the hope for an alternative currency to the dollar for transactions, a topic that frequently draws Trump's ire.",
      "\"Trump was never worried about democracy anywhere, much less with Bolsonaro's destiny,\" said Gleisi Hoffmann, Brazil's institutional relations minister.",
      "Trump's interference in Brazilian affairs has brought a sense of unity that was largely absent in the politically divided nation. Some of Bolsonaro's allies claimed Lula had drawn the U.S. president's anger with other decisions, including criticism of Israel's war in Gaza. But other supporters of the former president chose to ask for prudence in negotiations.",
      "Daily O Estado de S. Paulo, a frequent critic of Lula and his administration, said in an editorial on Thursday that Trump's move against the Brazilian government is \"a mafia thing.\" It also said Lula's reaction was correct, a rare feature for the newspaper.",
      "Analysts also see Trump's attempt to interfere in the country's domestic affairs as a potential backfire for Bolsonaro during his trial and a push for Lula, whose reelection bid was facing unpopularity headwinds this year.",
      "Canadians recently elected Mark Carney as prime minister, with his Liberal Party reenergized by Trump's tariffs and threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state.",
      "\"The reaction of a lot of people is that this is a political gift to Lula,\" said Andre Pagliarini, a professor of history and international studies at Louisiana State University who is also affiliated with the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.",
      "Thomas Traumann, an independent political consultant and former Brazilian minister, called Trump's move \"a game changer\" for next year's election.",
      "\"Trump put Lula back in the game,\" Traumann said. \"This gives Lula a narrative, puts Bolsonaro as the guilty part for any economic problems.\"",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled in May that Trump had exceeded his authority by declaring an emergency to impose tariffs without congressional approval. The Trump administration is appealing that decision, but opponents plan to use his Brazil letter to bolster their case.",
      "\"This is a brazenly illegal effort by Donald Trump to sacrifice the economy to settle his own personal scores, and it is far outside his legal authority,\" said Democratic Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden.",
      "The Republican administration has argued that their tariffs are now relatively harmless for the U.S. economy, since inflation has trended down in recent months. But many companies stockpiled imports to get ahead of the import taxes, and it's unclear what happens when their inventories dwindle and consumers consider the risk of higher prices. Most outside economic analyses expect growth to decline.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday threatened to impose 35% tariffs on goods from Canada starting next month, hiking import duties on one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners.",
      "The president announced the 35% tax in a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney posted to Truth Social, citing Canada's alleged \"failure to stop the drugs from pouring into our country,\" as well as retaliatory tariffs Canada has imposed on U.S. goods. The new tariffs are set to take effect Aug. 1, the president said.",
      "The move is an escalation from the 25% tariffs on Canadian \u2014 and Mexican \u2014 imports announced by Mr. Trump shortly after taking office. He later exempted goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement, which was negotiated during Mr. Trump's first term. It's unclear whether the same exemption will apply to next month's 35% tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump has sent similar letters to the leaders of more than 20 other countries this week, telling them to expect higher tariffs starting next month. He told NBC News' Kristen Welker on Thursday, \"all of the remaining countries\" will likely face tariffs of 15% to 20% \u2014 higher than the baseline 10% rate that's currently applied to all countries.",
      "But Canada is the largest American trading partner to receive a letter so far. Canada was the world's largest buyer of American goods and the third-largest seller of goods to the U.S. last year, according to Census Bureau data. The country bought some $350 billion worth of American goods and sold $412 billion to the U.S. market in 2024.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter to Carney says he will \"consider an adjustment to this letter\" if \"Canada works with me to stop the flow of Fentanyl.\" For months, the president has cast tariffs against Canada and Mexico as a way of getting the U.S.'s two neighbors to stem illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking, though very little fentanyl appears to enter the U.S. via Canada. Just 43 pounds were seized at the Canadian border last year, compared to 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border.",
      "\"Throughout the current trade negotiations with the United States, the Canadian government has steadfastly defended our workers and businesses,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney wrote in a social media post late Thursday night. \"We will continue to do so as we work towards the revised deadline of August 1.

      "The president also assailed Canada for \"retaliat[ing] with its own Tariffs.\" And he said Canada has imposed other barriers on U.S. imports.",
      "Mr. Trump has held on-and-off discussions with Canada for months, but his relationship with the United States' northern neighbor has occasionally been rocky, with U.S. tariffs drawing retaliatory duties from Canada. The president\u00a0briefly called off all trade talks\u00a0with Canada last month due to a planned digital services tax that could hit U.S. tech companies, but the talks\u00a0resumed days later\u00a0after Carney rescinded the tax.",
      "Mr. Trump has also\u00a0repeatedly mused about annexing Canada, and Carney's party won this year's parliamentary elections after the prime minister ran on a platform\u00a0of defending Canada from the Trump administration's ambitions.",
      "Trump boosts tariffs on dozens of countries",
      "The president is sending out this week's spate of tariff letters about three months after first unveiling \"reciprocal tariffs\" against dozens of countries on \"Liberation Day\" in early April, along with a 10% tariff on everybody else. The move unnerved financial markets and sparked recession and inflation fears, and Mr. Trump quickly suspended most of the duties for 90 days \u2014 aside from the 10% baseline rate \u2014 saying he planned to negotiate trade deals.",
      "With that 90-day pause set to expire this week, Mr. Trump began sending out letters to dozens of trading partners from Japan to South Africa informing them of their planned tariffs. The U.S. has trade deficits with most countries that received Mr. Trump's letters, though Brazil was also threatened with a 50% tariff despite the U.S. running a trade surplus. The letter cited the prosecution of right-wing former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called a \"Witch Hunt.\"",
      "On top of country-specific tariffs, the president has also imposed hefty \"sectoral\" tariffs on foreign steel, copper and other specific categories of goods.",
      "Mr. Trump says the tariffs are necessary to revive American manufacturing and correct trade imbalances. But many economists warn that tariffs lead to higher consumer prices and slower economic growth. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has said concerns about tariffs are partly to blame for the central bank's decision not to cut interest rates so far this year.",
      "Still, the president has stood by his trade strategy.",
      "\"I think the tariffs have been very well-received,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News on Thursday. \"The stock market hit a new high today.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 11 Jul 2025 15:32:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Unemployment is rising among recent college grads as employers turn to artificial intelligence to handle entry-level work.",
    "story": [
      "The rise of generative AI is making it harder for recent college graduates to get a foothold on the corporate ladder as they start their careers.",
      "Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to young grads have declined 15%, while the number of applications per job has surged 30%, according to data from Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z workers.",
      "Although people fresh out of college often struggle to land entry-level positions in their chosen field, \"there are early warning signs\" that AI is taking jobs away from the least experienced\u00a0 workers, Doug Calidas, senior vice president of government affairs for Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on emerging technologies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The unemployment rate for recent college graduates being unusually high seems relevant,\" he said.",
      "As of March, the U.S. unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 through 27 was 5.8%, considerably higher than the nation's overall 4% jobless rate at the time,\u00a0according\u00a0to the New York Federal Reserve.",
      "To be sure, most recent college grads are finding work, Calidas emphasized, adding that the latest job figures point to a \"deterioration,\" not a collapse, in opportunities for young people.",
      "Still, \"It's tough for students who feel like they have done the right thing their whole lives \u2014 they went into STEM careers or computer science because they expected software hiring to grow and grow, and that may not happen,\" he said.",
      "Just ask Michael Macaluso, 22, who this year earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Connecticut. Despite applying for roughly 200 positions, he has yet to land a job in his chosen field. For now, he's working as an assistant pool director at the Lake Isle Country Club in Eastchester, New York, his hometown.",
      "\"I was told by a lot of people, that I was going to get a job right out of college,\" he told CBS News' Ali Bauman. \"And then all of a sudden, there's no jobs.\"",
      "AI redefining the entry-level job",
      "Experts say that because AI is currently best at the kind of rote, repetitive tasks that are a staple of entry-level work, the very nature of what such roles consist of is likely to change.",
      "\"The AI piece is becoming more integrated, which is requiring a redefinition of what an entry-level role looks like and the types of skills that might be be needed,\" Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it's critical for new graduates to make sure they are exposing themselves to AI and learning how to use it.\"",
      "Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, according to Handshake.",
      "Liya Palagashvili, a labor economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch that jobs with low barriers to entry are being swallowed by AI. She points to a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School, Purdue University, and Stanford Graduate School of Business showing that generative AI is weighing on hiring in occupations that require little education, knowledge or training.",
      "\"Any job requiring lower levels or skills or training, that's where we are seeing a reduction in hiring due to an exposure to generative AI,\" Palagashvili said.",
      "By contrast, the study found that, since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for workers in occupations requiring a higher level of knowledge and training has risen.",
      "\"So you're seeing a two-segmented market thing going on with ChatGPT having a positive effect on occupations with higher barriers to labor entry, and having a negative effect on occupations that have low barriers to entry,\" Palagashvili said. \"The latest empirical evidence shows hiring is down in low-skilled occupations, but high in those that require a\u00a0 higher skill level.\"",
      "New technologies have always shaped the labor market, snuffing out certain professions while breathing life into new sectors. One difference with the rise of AI that the technology excels at job functions typically associated with white-collar work.",
      "The acceleration of AI could push more young people into skilled trades that don't require a high-priced college education, Calidas said.",
      "\"Since the automation that began in the 1970s, a lot of manual jobs have gone away,\" he said. \"For a few generations, it's been an article of faith that white-collar jobs are more safe, whereas blue-collar work is more precarious. There's been a cultural push toward sending people to college, but it might make more sense to go into the trades.\"",

      "The deal comes as Ferrero, which was launched Italy in 1946, seeks to broaden its reach in the U.S. and other international markets.

    "summary": "Business is being accused by Sen. Chuck Grassley of having \"spent years fleecing taxpayers.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 During President Trump's first term, an Ohio company was admonished by Republicans and Democrats in Congress after an audit claimed it made millions in excess profit from federal defense contracts.",
      "Facing bipartisan frustration, TransDigm Group Inc. eventually of its own accord paid the money back. Yet after another review in 2021 outlined similar concerns, the company did not voluntarily refund millions of dollars in question. Since then, campaign finance records show the company's CEO Kevin Stein has donated to candidates from both major political parties and gave more than $300,000 to the National Republican Congressional Committee earlier this year as Mr. Trump and many others within the GOP sharply criticized what they viewed as waste in government.",
      "\"Both sides should be screaming from the rooftops about this,\" William Hartung, a defense spending expert at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft think tank, said about TransDigm's business practices which he views as having taken advantage of a dysfunctional system.",
      "TransDigm may be little known to the public at large, but the company has attracted attention in the halls of Congress. Within the last decade, Stein has testified to lawmakers amid scrutiny of the business, which deals in parts for both military and commercial aircraft.",
      "\"As my oversight has exposed, TransDigm has spent years fleecing taxpayers to the tune of millions of dollars,\" Iowa GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley said in a statement. \"The Department of Defense Inspector General needs to conduct aggressive oversight of TransDigm's abuses and ensure proper accountability is had. At the same time, the Defense Department must step up its game to implement enhanced internal controls and explore alternative pathways of production, including through reverse engineering of spare parts, to avoid being swindled by contractors like TransDigm.\"",
      "TransDigm did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "In February 2019, an audit released by the Department of Defense Inspector General's Office \"determined that for 112 contracts, TransDigm earned $16.1 million in excess profit for 46 parts it sold to the [Defense Logistics Agency] and the Army for $26.2 million between January 2015 and January 2017.\"",
      "Months later as part of a House Oversight Committee hearing, Stein refuted the report, arguing in a written statement that its findings were \"based on cost data that excludes many actual costs of doing business.\"",
      "Still, lawmakers took issue with the company.",
      "North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, who would later become Mr. Trump's chief of staff towards the end of the president's first term, encouraged the company during the hearing to \"chalk it up to marketing expense and pay the American taxpayer back immediately.\"",
      "Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz argued the business was \"grossly robbing the American taxpayers and impacting our military readiness and our ability to make sure that we have the ability to accomplish mission-critical goals.\"",
      "Across Capitol Hill that same day, Grassley said during a speech that the report \"exposes a galactic price gouging, colossal rip-off and out-of-this-world waste.\"",
      "The company later voluntarily repaid the $16.1 million.",
      "Close to three years later, during Democratic President Joe Biden's tenure, the Defense Department's Inspector General's Office released another report looking at January 2017 to June 2019. That audit alleged findings \"that TransDigm earned excess profit of at least $20.8 million on 105 spare parts on 150 contracts.\"",
      "A 2022 House hearing on that report was far more politically divisive than the similar one held in 2019. Stein testified again, and shared what he described as deep concern \"with the fundamental errors in this report,\" while some Republicans took issue with the attention being trained on TransDigm.",
      "\"I don't think we should be picking on any one company, particularly an American-owned company, here,\" North Carolina GOP Rep. Virginia Foxx said during the hearing.",
      "Democrats continued to challenge company leaders, along with Grassley, a Republican.",
      "\"You all are the perfect poster child of an out-of-control defense budget that puts the interests of wealthy, well-connected people like yourselves ahead of the best interests of the American people,\" progressive Michigan Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib said at the time.",
      "Later, Grassley signed a letter asking for the amount of money identified in the 2021 audit to be repaid. A response from Stein obtained by CBS News shows the CEO argued that \"while the headline from the audit report may be TransDigm made \"excess profit,\" the reality is that this conclusion is derived from the audit report inexplicably counting millions of dollars of real costs as profit and creating an artificial profit measure not found in law.\"",
      "The Defense Department, which has the largest discretionary budget in the federal government, has long been susceptible to price gouging contracts. According to the Pentagon's inspector general, the Government Accountability Office has included the Defense Department's contract management in its \"High\u2011Risk List\" of programs vulnerable to waste and fraud since 1992.",
      "A spokesperson for the federal government's Defense Logistics Agency told CBS news on Tuesday that in early 2022, it had \"requested voluntary refunds from TransDigm for the $20.8M identified in the 2021 report.\"",
      "\"To date, DLA has not received a refund and TransDigm has not indicated their intent to pay,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Before the 2024 general elections, Stein donated to help Mr. Trump's presidential run, as well as to political efforts for Republicans and Democrats. On occasion, that resulted in his giving to a Democratic incumbent \u2014 and the Republican challenger \u2014 as he did in a recent Senate race in Pennsylvania that ended with then Democratic Sen. Bob Casey narrowly losing to Republican Dave McCormick.",
      "Last year, after having donated to Republicans, Stein also gave money to a few House Democratic candidates including some from frontline seats in the 2024 cycle whose wins went on to play a part in keeping Republicans' majority narrow.",
      "Stein has also helped fund a political operation that received donations from TransDigm leaders. Records show from late 2019 until the end of last year, the group called TransDigm Group Inc. Employee Political Action Committee gave money to dozens of Democrats and Republicans, including candidates from both major parties who now hold roles on the House oversight panel that in the past has questioned the company, as well as politicians who are part of Democratic leadership.",
      "After starting at TransDigm in 2014, Stein rose through the ranks over time, according to an online biography. Earlier this year, the company announced that he would retire as CEO at the end of September. Republican Ohio Rep. Max Miller, whose campaign counts Stein as a donor, called him \"a great guy.\"",
      "\"In terms of my dealings with him, he's been very straight and narrow,\" Miller said. \"I've had dealings with other people who are not straight and narrow that I will not take money from and tell them, 'bye and there's the door.' And believe it or not, members of Congress do that more frequently than people would think.\"",
      "A clear focus of Stein's political donations in the early part of this year has been House Republicans. Through a joint fundraising group tied to Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer, the third highest-ranking Republican in the House, money from Stein has also gone towards a set of Republican campaigns that could be critical in deciding which party holds control of the House for the final two years of Mr. Trump's time in the White House.",
      "Republicans losing just three seats in the House could be the difference between the GOP having unified control of Washington for the final two years of Trump's presidency or the party's power and influence being limited before he leaves office.",
      "Outside of the House chamber last week, New York GOP Rep. Mike Lawler maintained that congressional Republicans and the Trump administration are looking to root out waste in government. He pushed back however on any concerns about the CEO's political spending after being asked about the dollars that have recently been given to his own campaign and other House Republican political operations.",
      "\"Obviously, in America, people are able to support whoever they want,\" Lawler said. \"We don't live in communist Russia, unless you would like to go down that road.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 10 Jul 2025 10:29:00 -0400",
    "summary": "One of the highest tariffs threatened by President Trump so far is against Brazil, with the president citing a criminal prosecution against Jair Bolsonaro.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Wednesday he would impose a 50% tariff on goods from Brazil next month, one of the steepest rates for any U.S. trading partner, citing the criminal prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, which Mr. Trump called an \"international disgrace.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sent open letters to about 20 countries this week \u2014 ranging from Japan to Iraq \u2014 telling them to expect higher tariffs starting Aug.\u00a01, after delaying his sweeping tariffs against dozens of nations in April. So far, the 50% tariff on Brazilian imports is the highest rate threatened against any country, and Brazil is the only country to get hit with a tariff this week after being spared by Mr. Trump's April \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.",
      "Unlike many other countries that have been threatened with tariff hikes, the U.S. runs a trade surplus with Brazil, meaning Brazil buys more American goods than the U.S. buys from Brazil. Last year, the U.S. exported about $49 billion worth of goods to Brazil, and Brazil exported just over $42 billion in goods to the U.S., according to Census Bureau figures.",
      "Mr. Trump's letter excoriated the South American country over the prosecution of Bolsonaro, who led the country before current Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The U.S. leader called the prosecution a \"Witch Hunt that should end immediately.\"",
      "Bolsonaro was indicted last year for allegedly attempting a coup to remain in office after Lula defeated him in the 2022 elections. The plan allegedly included dozens of people and involved a plot to poison Lula and shoot a Brazilian Supreme Court justice. Bolsonaro's defense team has vehemently denied the charges. Bolsonaro has also been barred from running for office until 2030, after casting doubt on the country's electronic voting machines.",
      "Mr. Trump has long expressed support for Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist sometimes known as \"Trump of the Tropics.\" He also lashed out at Brazil over the prosecution on Monday, calling it a \"terrible thing\" and an \"attack on a Political Opponent.\"",
      "\"LEAVE BOLSONARO ALONE!\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump also criticized Brazil in his tariff letter for what he called \"insidious attacks\" on the \"Free Speech Rights of Americans,\" an apparent reference to the Brazilian Supreme Court's scrutiny of Elon Musk-owned X and some other social media platforms. And he alleged Brazil has an \"unfair trade relationship\" with the U.S., citing \"Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers.\"",
      "In the letter, Mr. Trump ordered U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to open an investigation into Brazil over \"attacks on the Digital Trade Activities of American Companies\" and \"other unfair Trading Practices.\"",
      "A report by the U.S. Trade Representative earlier this year said Brazil charged an average tariff of 11.2% on imports as of 2023. The report says Brazil imposes \"relatively high tariffs on imports across a wide range of sectors,\" and \"U.S. exporters face significant uncertainty in the Brazilian market because the government frequently modifies tariff rates.\" It also lists some other trade restrictions, like a tariff on ethanol and import licensing rules.",
      "As with the other countries that have faced tariff threats, Mr. Trump said his administration would \"consider an adjustment\" if Brazil were to change its trade practices.",
      "Lula said in a post on X that Brazil will react to any tariff increases by invoking the country's economic reciprocity law, which allows Brazil to impose import restrictions and other countermeasures in response to unilateral tariffs. He also pointed to the U.S.'s trade surplus with Brazil, said the proceedings against Bolsonaro \"fall exclusively under the jurisdiction of Brazil\u00b4s Judicial Branch\" and wrote that companies \"must comply with Brazilian law in order to operate within our territory.\"",
      "\"Brazil is a sovereign nation with independent institutions and will not accept any form of tutelage,\" Lula wrote in the statement, as translated by Brazil's embassy in D.C.",
      "Separately, Mr. Trump threatened an additional 10% tariff on any countries aligned with \"the Anti-American policies of BRICS,\" referring to a group of developing countries and emerging markets that includes Brazil.",
      "Tariffs are a core part of Mr. Trump's economic strategy. The moves have sparked fears of rising consumer prices and an economic slowdown, but Mr. Trump argues tariffs are necessary to revive U.S. manufacturing and punish what he views as unfair trade practices.",
      "The president imposed steep tariffs on dozens of countries in early April, rattling markets, before quickly delaying most of them for three months while his administration sought to negotiate trade deals. With the three-month extension set to run out this week, the administration began sending letters to various countries informing them of higher tariffs starting in August.",

    "summary": "Manufacturers and construction companies \u2014 as well as consumers \u2014 would face higher prices if the U.S. jacks up tariffs on copper, analysts said.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's move to impose a 50% tariff on U.S. copper imports targets a vital metal that is widely used in many products and industries. That could lead to higher prices for everything from appliances and electronics to cars and home repairs, economists and industry experts said.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the copper duties late Wednesday on his Truth Social platform, saying they will take effect Aug 1.",
      "\"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many,\" he wrote. \"Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) 'Leaders' decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity. America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry.\"",
      "Price jump",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said copper is an integral component in electrical wiring and plumbing, as well being used as a heat conductor in radiators and household appliances. He worries that a hefty copper tariff will trigger inflation.",
      "Copper prices had already surged 13% on Tuesday, reaching a record high, after Mr. Trump floated the possible tariff.",
      "\"It's bad news all around,\" Young said of Mr. Trump's proposed copper tariff. \"If companies' costs go up they pass them along to consumers, so we'd see higher prices for home repairs and anything that uses copper.\"",
      "Copper tariffs could also make maintaining the nation's electric grid more expensive and drive up household energy costs, Young said. \"It would negatively affect the electricity industry and anybody who uses electricity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that tariffs provide financial incentives to ramp up domestic production, including of critical materials like copper, and help create manufacturing jobs.",
      "\"America cannot be reliant on foreign imports of the copper that's necessary for key military hardware, infrastructure and everyday electronics,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump administration is committed to reshoring manufacturing that's critical [to] our national and economic security with a two-pronged approach of tariffs and a full suite of supply-side reforms like deregulation and the pro-growth tax cuts of The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Ripple effects",
      "The biggest users of copper \u2014 and therefore most exposed to the tariff increase \u2014 include a vast range of industries, covering everything from construction to semiconductors, electric vehicles and renewable energy components such as solar panels, according to industry data.",
      "Daan de Jonge, copper demand and prices lead analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that \"a 50% price hike will have inevitable ripple effects on the cost of new infrastructure, the cost of housing the cost of fridges, cars, air conditioning.\"",
      "For consumers, that means the cost of appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as EVs, would likely rise if this 50% tariff goes into effect, according to analysts.",
      "\"Copper is an important element in development of semiconductors and electric vehicles. And the tariff announcement caused prices to go up quite dramatically, so you can tell it's a pretty big deal,\" Veronique de Rugy, a professor of political economy and senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The reason President Trump picked copper is because it's such a big deal for a lot of important things.\"",
      "Carveouts for key partners?",
      "The U.S. gets roughly two-thirds of its copper imports from Chile and Canada, with additional supply coming from Peru and Mexico.\u00a0 The U.S.'s net copper imports met 53% of U.S. demand for copper last year, according to Morgan Stanley research.",
      "Experts note that Mr. Trump isn't certain to hike duties on copper, saying his proposal could be aimed more at securing concession from exporters.",
      "\"These are two examples of countries that the U.S. could offer some sort of quota or export restraint relief to as part of a broader deal,\" UBS chief investment strategist Kurt Reiman told CBS MoneyWatch, referring to Canada and Chile. A revamped U.S. trade policy could also include carveouts for foreign copper suppliers, he added",
      "Although the U.S. could ramp up domestic copper production, it would take years to significantly increase output, Reiman said. \"We aren't ready. The mines would have to be built out, and that's typically a multi-year process.\"",
      "The sectoral tariff threats come after Mr. Trump this week announced stiff new tariff rates on 20 nations\u00a0that have not yet reached trade agreements with the U.S and that he said would take effect on Aug. 1. He outlined the new rates, posted in nearly identical letters on Truth Social, as a 90-day pause on so-called \"reciprocal\" levies was\u00a0set to expire\u00a0on Wednesday.",

      "McDonald's is reviving fan favorites, spicing up its menu and emphasizing low-cost items to bring inflation-weary customers back to the Golden Arches.",
      "The world's largest restaurant chain recently announced it was bringing back the popular Snack Wrap, which makes its return to McD's outlets on July 10, along with a new, limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin sandwich, which debuted on July 8. The refreshed menu comes as the company looks to boost sales as budget-conscious consumers pull back on spending.",
      "Same-store sales at McDonald's outlets in the U.S. declined 3.6% in the first quarter, the biggest drop since the COVID-19 pandemic closed stores nationwide. At the same time, traffic among low-income customers was down \"nearly double digits,\" CEO Chris Kempczinski said on the company's May earnings call, reflecting a customer base that the company acknowledged is still feeling the effects of inflation.",
      "McDonald's isn't the first fast-food chain to use promotions to drive business, but it has long been among the most adept at tweaking its menu and pricing, while its scale makes it a bellwether for customer tastes. In January, for example, it introduced\u00a0the McValue\u00a0menu, which includes the $5 meal deal, along with a \"buy one, add one for $1\" deal, as the company leaned into affordable offerings.",
      "McDonald's is reacting to a number of economic and competitive pressures, said Matthew Todd, a director at S&P Global Ratings. Chief among them is continuing to deliver value to low-income consumers in a time of economic uncertainty.",

      "Sara Senatore, a research analyst at the Bank of America, told CBS MoneyWatch that McDonald's move to expand its affordable offerings is an attempt to \"stay relevant\" with low-income consumers, who are \"under much greater pressure than other cohorts.\"",
      "Other fast-food chains and restaurants also have seen weaker sales as consumers battered by higher prices and the general cost of living look to save cash. For McDonald's, which has over 13,500\u00a0locations\u00a0nationwide, the difference now is it's not outperforming competitors as much as it once was, Senatore said.",
      "\"Their same-store sales versus their direct competitors have been much more similar than different,\" she said. \"Whereas, if you look at its long-term history, McDonald's has historically outpaced their competitors.\"",
      "McDonald's did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on the strategy behind its menu changes.",
      "Return of the Snack Wrap",
      "Perhaps the most highly anticipated new menu item is the Snack Wrap, which is returning to McDonald's establishments nationwide on this week after a nine-year hiatus. The wrap, which consists of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, was nixed in 2016, sparking a social media campaign by fans lobbying for its return.",
      "\"Given that they're looking for sales drivers, it makes sense that they would go to their archives, if you will,\" Senatore said.",
      "The revived Snack Wrap will come in two flavors \u2014 Ranch and Spicy \u2014 and will be priced at $2.99, according to a McDonald's spokesperson. The main protein will consist of chicken strips \u2014 easier to prepare, and thus less labor-intensive, than the type of chicken McD's previously used in the wrap, which required more cutting, Senatore explained.",
      "Reviving the Snack Wrap is a strategic decision on McDonald's part given the item's cult following. Customers went so far ast to start a Change.org petition garnering more than 19,000 signatures urging McDonald's to bring back the Snack Wrap.",
      "\"Bringing back a product that customers really want to have come back, you typically have higher rate of success,\" Senatore said.",
      "McDonald's is also introducing a new take on its classic Egg McMuffin, with a trio of limited-time breakfast sandwiches featuring spicy pepper sauce. The new items coincide with the 50th anniversary of the Egg McMuffin, a McDonald's staple that consists of egg, cheese and Canadian bacon on an English muffin.",
      "\"Limited-time offerings are always something in the toolkit for quick service restaurants to drive traffic,\" Todd said.",
      "Other menu tweaks include a new home for the Daily Double, one of McDonald's burger offerings. The Daily Double will now be part of the the McValue deal, where it will be bundled with fries, Chicken McNuggets, and a small soft drink for $6 or $7, depending on the location.",
      "McDonald's has also upped its chicken offerings. In May, the chain launched a new item called McCrispy Strips nationwide, the first time since 2021 McDonald's debuted a new permanent menu item in the U.S, according to a company\u00a0statement.",
      "Todd said McDonald's and other industry players are emphasizing chicken meals given its popularity and that it is significantly cheaper than beef, which rose to record prices in May.",
      "\"We've been seeing tons of chicken offerings, and just chicken... in general being very successful,\" he said.",

    "summary": "As of Tuesday, passengers at U.S. airports are no longer required to remove their shoes during the TSA screening process.",
    "story": [
      "The Transportation Security Administration's shoe rule expired on Monday, relieving fliers of the requirement to remove their footwear\u00a0while passing through security before boarding a plane.",
      "Speaking at a press briefing on Tuesday at Washington, D.C.'s Reagan National Airport, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said that starting Tuesday, all passengers traveling through domestic airports can keep their shoes on while moving through TSA checkpoints.",
      "\"TSA will no longer require travelers to remove their shoes when they go through our security checkpoints,\" Noem said, adding that she expects travelers to be \"very excited\" at the policy change.",
      "Previously, only travelers enrolled in TSA PreCheck could keep their shoes on. The TSA on Monday did not issue a statement confirming the end of the policy, but sources familiar with the matter on Monday confirmed the change to CBS News.",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, an industry advocacy group, cheered the rule change. \"The days of removing your shoes at airport security checkpoints are finally behind us \u2014 and that's a win for all travelers,\" CEO Geoff Freeman said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "\"Thanks to cutting-edge screening technology and strong decision-making, all travelers will now experience a more secure, seamless and efficient process at Transportation Security Administration (TSA) checkpoints. Keeping shoes on will reduce wait times and streamline air travel for all Americans,\" he added.",
      "Here's what to know about the status of the TSA's updated shoe policy.",
      "What is the \"shoes-off\" rule?",
      "The TSA screening policy, known informally as the \"shoes-off rule,\" was instituted in 2006 after British terrorist Richard Reid unsuccessfully tried to detonate homemade bombs hidden in his shoes during a December 2001 flight from Paris to Miami. The shoes he wore on the flight contained 10 ounces of explosive material, according\u00a0to an FBI account of the incident.",
      "The shoe-removal policy went into effect in August 2006. \"Based on intelligence pointing to a continuing threat, TSA requires passengers to remove shoes to screen for explosives,\" the TSA states on a policy timeline on its website.",
      "Under the policy, the TSA required passengers in standard screening lines to remove and place their shoes on X-ray belts, along with laptops, liquids, belts and outerwear.",
      "Passengers with TSA PreCheck benefits were exempt from the shoe removal requirement.",
      "Do I still have to take my shoes off?",
      "Not as long as TSA screeners are following the revised policy. As of Tuesday, the agency will no longer require passengers who move through TSA checkpoints to remove their shoes.",
      "That said, TSA officers may still flag some travelers for additional screening measures. \"Once in a while, someone will have to remove their shoes if they need additional layers of screening,\" Noem said Tuesday.",
      "On Monday, before the rule change was announced, some airports across the U.S. had already started phasing out the security measure and begun allowing fliers to move through security with their shoes on, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News.",
      "Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA worker who now runs Gate Access, a site about passenger rights, was the first to report on the policy shift, calling it \"one of the biggest changes to TSA screening in over a decade.\"",
      "\"It marks a huge shift in what the average traveler is used to going through TSA,\" he said.",
      "The revised shoes-on policy was already in effect at seven U.S. airports on Monday, according to CBS News sources. The first airports to ditch the security measure include Baltimore/Washington International Airport; Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport; Fort Lauderdale International Airport; Philadelphia International Airport; Piedmont Triad International Airport in North Carolina; and Portland International Airport.",
      "Some passengers at New York's LaGuardia Airport also reported being allowed to keep their shoes on Monday.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday re-posted a CBS News report on the rule change on social media, describing it as \"Big news from @DHSgov!\" .",
      "Will this mean shorter security lines?",
      "Harmon-Marshall of Gate Access told CBS MoneyWatch that he expects the policy change to result in shorter airport screening lines and an expedited security process for all passengers. In come cases, TSA officers could still ask passengers to remove their footwear.",
      "\"They still have that discretion,\" he said.",
      "For passengers, Harmon-Marshall expects screening time to \"drop significantly.\"",
      "\"Allowing passengers to keep their shoes on in the standard line will make going through TSA a breeze,\" he predicted.",
      "The revamped shoe policy could also have implications for TSA PreCheck, which costs around $80 for five years, Harmon added.",
      "\"TSA has to figure out what the value proposition of PreCheck is,\" he said. \"Allowing passengers to access screening with their shoes on diminishes its value, which leads me to believe there is another shakeup coming with TSA PreCheck.\"",
      "Noem on Tuesday said PreCheck status still offers advantages to pass holders because they're not required to take off their belts or remove liquids and electronics from their bags, unlike other passengers.",
      "\"I believe PreCheck will still be something many travelers will want to utilize,\" she said.",
      "She added that DHS will continue to evaluate all TSA screening procedures for efficiency. Homeland Security also plans to test new security lanes at TSA checkpoints over the next six to nine months that allow travelers to move through security even more quickly.",

      "Despite the modest annual increase, the rise in the share of investor home purchases is more a reflection of how much the housing market has slowed as traditional buyers face growing affordability constraints, according to BatchData.",
      "Housing sales slump",

      "They've remained sluggish so far this year, as many prospective homebuyers have been discouraged by elevated mortgage rates and home prices that have kept climbing, though more slowly.",
      "As home sales have slowed, properties are taking longer to sell. That's led to a sharply higher inventory of homes on the market, benefitting investors and other home shoppers who can afford to bypass current mortgage rates by paying in cash or tapping home equity gains.",

      "CBS News found multiple paid advertisements on Meta's Instagram stories feature that promoted opportunities to meet women alongside URL links that led to the Telegram platform.

      "Meta also confirmed to CBS News that it had banned the administrators of the ad accounts from advertising on the company's social media platforms.",
      "Logan pointed to the company's human exploitation policy, which includes removing \"content where a third-party actor recruits for, facilitates or benefits from commercial sexual activity,\" as well as the company's adult sexual solicitation policy which, amongst other things, removes \"content that offers, asks or provides methods of contact for prostitution.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club's Telegram channel explicitly offered potential clients access to \"over 7,000 girls worldwide for fun dates, relationships and hot sex.\" That included advertising a \"VIP lifetime\" offer of $8,000 of \"top models, bloggers, actresses, athletes, magazine cover girls, adult stars.\"",

    "story": [
      "In Connecticut, construction workers in the Local 478 union who complete addiction treatment are connected with a recovery coach who checks in daily, attends recovery meetings with them, and helps them navigate their return to work for a year.",
      "In Pennsylvania, doctors applying for credentials at Geisinger hospitals are not required to answer intrusive questions about mental health care they've received, reducing the stigma around clinicians seeking treatment.",
      "The workplace is the new ground zero for addressing mental health. That means companies \u2014 employees and supervisors alike \u2014 must confront crises, from addiction to suicide. The two seemingly unrelated initiatives in Connecticut and Pennsylvania have one common factor: They grew out of the work of a little known federal agency called the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.",
      "It's one of the key federal agencies leading workplace mental health efforts, from decreasing alarmingly high rates of suicide among construction workers to addressing burnout and depression among health care workers.",
      "But after gaining considerable traction during the COVID-19 pandemic, that work is now imperiled. The Trump administration has fired a majority of NIOSH staffers and is proposing severe reductions to its budget.",
      "Private industry and nonprofits may be able to fill some of the gap, but they can't match the federal government's resources. And some companies may not prioritize worker well-being above profits.",
      "About 60% of employees worldwide say their job is the chief factor affecting their mental health, according to a survey by human resources consulting company UKG. A 2015 study in Management Science suggests workplace stress causes about 120,000 deaths and accounts for up to 8% of health costs in the U.S. each year.",
      "\"Workplace mental health is one of the most underappreciated yet critical areas we could intervene on,\" said Thomas Cunningham, a former senior behavioral scientist at NIOSH who took a buyout this year. \"We were just starting to get some strong support from all the players involved,\" he said. \"This administration has blown that apart.\"",
      "NIOSH, established in 1970 by the same law that created the better-known Occupational Safety and Health Administration, is charged with producing research that informs workplace safety regulations. It's best known for monitoring black lung disease in coal miners and for testing masks, like the N95s used during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "As part of the mass firing of federal workers this spring, NIOSH was slated to lose upward of 900 employees. After pushback from members of Congress \u2014 primarily over coal miner and first responder safety \u2014 the administration reinstated 328. It's not clear if any rehired workers focus on mental health initiatives.",
      "At least two lawsuits challenging the firings are winding through the courts. Meanwhile, hundreds of NIOSH employees remain on administrative leave, unable to work.",
      "Emily Hilliard, a press secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services, asserted in a statement that \"the nation's critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\" including support for coal miners and firefighters through NIOSH. \"Improving the mental health of American workers remains a key priority for HHS, and that work is ongoing,\" she wrote.",
      "She did not answer specific questions from KFF Health News about whether any reinstated NIOSH employees lead mental health efforts or who is continuing such work.",
      "Reducing suicides and addiction in construction and mining",
      "Over 5,000 construction workers die by suicide annually \u2014 five times the number who die from work-related injuries, according to the Center for Construction Research and Training. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows miners suffer high rates too. And nearly a fifth of workers in both industries have a substance use disorder, double the rate among all U.S. workers, according to a report from NORC at the University of Chicago and the National Safety Council.",
      "Kyle Zimmer recognized these issues as early as 2010. That's when he started a members' assistance program for the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 478 in Connecticut. He hired a licensed clinician on retainer and developed partnerships with local treatment facilities.",
      "At first, workers pushed back, said Zimmer, who recently retired after 25 years in the union, many as director of health and safety.",
      "Their perception was, \"If I speak up about this issue, I'm going to be blackballed from the industry,\" he said.",
      "But slowly, that changed \u2014 with NIOSH's help, Zimmer said.",
      "The agency developed an approach to worker safety called Total Worker Health, which identifies physical and mental health as critical to occupational safety. It also shifts the focus from how individuals can keep themselves safe to how policies and environments can be changed to keep them safe.",
      "Over decades, the concept spread from research journals and universities to industry conferences, unions, and eventually workers, Zimmer said. People began accepting that mental health was an occupational safety issue, he said. That paved the way for NIOSH's Miner Health Program to develop resources on addiction and for Zimmer to establish the recovery coaching program in Connecticut.",
      "\"We have beat that stigma down by a lot,\" Zimmer said.",
      "Other countries have made more progress on mental health at work, said Sally Spencer-Thomas, co-chair of the International Association for Suicide Prevention's workplace special interest group. But with the growth of the Total Worker Health approach, a 2022 surgeon general report on the topic, and increasing research, the U.S. appeared to finally be catching up. The recent cuts to NIOSH suggest \"we're kind of losing our footing,\" she said.",
      "Last year, Natalie Schwatka, an assistant professor at the Colorado School of Public Health's Center for Health, Work & Environment, received a five-year NIOSH grant to build a toolkit to help leaders in labor-intensive industries, such as construction and mining, strengthen worker safety and mental health.",
      "While many companies connect people to treatment, few focus on preventing mental illness, Schwatka said. NIOSH funding \"allows us to do innovative things that maybe industry wouldn't necessarily start.\"",
      "Her team planned to test the toolkit with eight construction companies in the coming years. But with few NIOSH employees left to process annual renewals, the funds could stop flowing anytime.",
      "The consequence of losing such research is not confined to academia, Zimmer said. \"Workers' health and safety is very much in jeopardy.\"",
      "Health care sector braces for fallout from NIOSH cuts",
      "For a long time, clinicians have had troubling rates of addiction and suicide risk. Just after the height of the pandemic, a NIOSH survey found nearly half of health workers reported feeling burned out and nearly half intended to look for a new job. The agency declared a mental health crisis in that workforce.",
      "NIOSH received $20 million through the American Rescue Plan Act to create a national campaign to improve the mental health of health workers.",
      "The results included a step-by-step guide for hospital leaders to improve systems to support their employees, as well as tips and suggested language for leaders to discuss well-being and for workers to advocate for better policies.",
      "Cunningham, the behavioral scientist who left NIOSH this year, helped lead the effort. He said the goal was to move beyond asking health workers to be resilient or develop meditation skills.",
      "\"We're not saying resilience is bad, but we're trying to emphasize that's not the first thing we need to focus on,\" he said.",
      "Instead, NIOSH suggested eliminating intrusive questions about mental health that weren't relevant to keeping patients safe from hospital credentialing forms and offering workers more input on how their schedules are made.",
      "The agency partnered on this work with the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Foundation, named after an emergency medicine doctor who died by suicide during the pandemic. The foundation extended the campaign by helping health systems in four states implement pieces of the guide and learn from one another.",
      "Foundation leaders recently appeared on Capitol Hill with Noah Wyle, who plays an emergency physician on the TV series \"The Pitt,\" to advocate for renewed federal funding for this work.",
      "Corey Feist, foundation CEO and co-founder, said renewing that funding to NIOSH is crucial to get this guide out to all hospitals.",
      "Without those resources, \"it's just going to really delay this transformation of health care that needs to happen,\" he said.",
      "Who can fill the gap?",
      "TJ Lyons, a multidecade construction industry safety professional who has worked at big-name companies such as Gilbane, Turner, and DPR Construction, is confident that workplace mental health will remain a priority despite the NIOSH cuts.",
      "General contractors and project owners have been incorporating budget lines for mental health support for years, he said, sharing an example of a $1 billion project that included a mental health clinician on call for four hours several days a week. Workers would make appointments to sit in their pickup trucks during lunch breaks and talk to her, he said.",
      "Now when these big companies subcontract with smaller firms, they often ask if the subcontractors provide mental health support for workers, Lyons said.",
      "But others are skeptical that industry can replace NIOSH efforts.",
      "Several workplace safety experts said smaller companies lack the means to commission research studies and larger companies may not share the results publicly, as a federal agency would. Nor would they have the same credibility.",
      "\"Private industry is going to provide what the people paying them want to provide,\" said a NIOSH employee and member of the American Federation of Government Employees union, currently on administrative leave, who was granted anonymity for fear of professional retaliation.",
      "Without federal attention on workplace mental health, \"people may leave the workforce,\" she said. \"Workers may die.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

Mr. Trump's threat came after a series of announcements last week that included warnings of a possible 50% levy on all copper imports and all goods from Brazil, 35% levies on Canadian goods, and a possible 200% tariff on imported pharmaceuticals.",
      "In announcing his latest intentions on Saturday, Mr. Trump cited Mexico's role in illicit drugs flowing into the United States and a trade imbalance with the European Union.",
      "The move threw months of painstaking talks with Brussels into disarray.",
      "European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen has insisted the EU still wants to reach an accord with the U.S. On Sunday, the bloc delayed its planned retaliation for separate U.S. duties on steel and aluminum. EU officials had threatened in May to impose tariffs on U.S. goods worth around $117 billion, including cars and planes, if talks fail, from July 14.",
      "Von der Leyen said Sunday that Mr. Trump's letter showed \"that we have until the first of August\" to negotiate.",
      "\"We have always been clear that we prefer a negotiated solution,\" von der Leyen said, adding: \"We will continue to prepare countermeasures so we are fully prepared.\"",
      "In April, Mr. Trump imposed tariffs on dozens of countries, quickly pausing them for three months to negotiate deals. As that 90 day period ended this week, Mr. Trump started sending tariff letters to leaders, but he pushed back the date of implementation of the threatened levies until August, The Associated Press reported.",
      "The EU's trade chief, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, said he planned to speak with his U.S. counterparts on Monday.",
      "\"I'm absolutely 100% sure that a negotiated solution is much better than the tension which we might have after the 1st of August,\" \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told journalists in Brussels. \"I cannot imagine walking away without genuine effort. Having said that, the current uncertainty caused by unjustified tariffs cannot persist indefinitely and therefore we must prepare for all outcomes, including, if necessary, well-considered proportionate countermeasures to restore the balance in our transit static relationship.\"",
      "He noted that the EU was also \"doubling down on efforts to open new markets\" beyond the United States.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron backed efforts to reach an agreement that \"reflects the respect that trade partners such as the European Union and the United States owe each other,\" but he urged the bloc to \"step up the preparation of credible countermeasures\" in the event the two sides fail to reach an agreement.",
      "Shares fell in Frankfurt and Paris, though London saw prices tick higher.",
      "In Asia, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Seoul, Singapore, Manila, Bangkok and Jakarta all rose, while Tokyo, Sydney, Taipei, Mumbai and Wellington edged down.",
      "Bitcoin hit a new record high of $123,205.",
      "\"It is hard to say whether the muted market response over the week is best characterised by resilience or complacency,\" National Australia Bank's Taylor Nugent said. \"But it is difficult to price the array of headlines purportedly defining where tariffs will sit from 1 August when negotiations are ongoing.\"",
      "Data showed Chinese exports jumped more than expected in June after Washington and Beijing agreed a tentative deal to lower levies on each other. That included a 32.4% surge in shipments to the U.S., which had dropped in May.",
      "Traders were also keeping a nervous eye on the Federal Reserve as Mr. Trump continued to berate boss Jerome Powell for not cutting interest rates soon enough, saying Sunday \"I hope he quits,\" and \"he should quit.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump is set to meet with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte this week on the heels of the U.S. leader announcing plans to sell NATO allies weapons that it can pass on to Ukraine.",
      "In a statement, NATO said Rutte will be in Washington on Monday and Tuesday and will also meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and members of Congress.",
      "CBS News reached out to the White House for additional comment.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham confirmed on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal will be meeting with Rutte on Monday.",
      "\"A turning point regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine is coming,\" Graham said.",
      "While NATO's statement did not state a reason for Rutte's trip, it comes after Mr. Trump teased last week that he would make a \"major statement\" on Russia on Monday, as Ukraine struggles to repel massive and complex air assaults launched by Russian forces.",
      "The president also hinted that his administration will send more defensive weapons to Ukraine amid its war with Russia, days after\u00a0pausing\u00a0some weapons shipments.",
      "\"We're going to send some more weapons. We have to. They have to be able to defend themselves,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a White House event with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday night.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Sunday the U.S. would be sending more Patriot missiles to Ukraine, but that he hadn't yet\u00a0decided how many.",
      "Graham said on \"Face the Nation\" to \"stay tuned for a plan where America will begin to sell to our European allies tremendous amounts of weapons that can benefit Ukraine.\"",
      "\"The idea of America selling weapons to help Ukraine is very much in play,\" Graham said. \"We've given Ukraine a lot. We give them the money, we give them military aid. We now have a minerals agreement with Ukraine that's worth trillions of dollars. So, I don't want to get ahead of the President, but stay tuned about seized assets. The Europeans want to limit the interest on the assets to go to Ukraine.\"",
      "Rubio said Friday that some of the U.S.-made weapons that Ukraine is seeking are deployed with NATO allies in Europe. Those weapons could be transferred to Ukraine, with European countries buying replacements from the U.S., he said.",
      "\"It's a lot faster to move something, for example, from Germany to Ukraine than it is to order it from a (U.S.) factory and get it there,\" Rubio told reporters last week during a visit to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.",
      "Mr. Trump is also facing calls from Republicans and Democrats, as well as European allies, to support legislation in the Senate that aims to cripple Russia's oil industry and hit Moscow with U.S. sanctions for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The legislation, in part, calls for a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that continue to buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports. It would have an enormous impact on economic behemoths China and India, which account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade.",
      "Graham said he and Blumenthal have support for \"congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer\" that will \"go after\" Russian President Vladimir Putin's economy and \"all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine.\"",
      "\"This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia, and props up Putin's war machine,\" Graham said. \"He can dial it up or down. He can go to 0%, to 500%. He has maximum flexibility. But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.\"",
      "Blumenthal said this is a \"critical moment\" for these sanctions and \"bringing down this sledgehammer at this moment was emphasized by all of the European allies who were at the meeting that Sen. Graham and I attended in Europe.\"",
      "Elsewhere, multiple diplomatic sources told CBS News that Mr. Trump is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since he took office in January.",
      "The sources indicated the new funding could be intended to send a message to Russia. U.S. officials told CBS News Mr. Trump has $3.85 billion in leftover Biden-era presidential drawdown authority sitting at his fingertips, which could be used to send American military equipment to Ukraine. Former officials also told CBS News the president\u00a0has the authority to seize\u00a0around $5 billion in foreign Russian assets and direct the funds to Ukraine, though neither he nor former President Joe Biden has used that power.",
      "Congress has been prepared to act on the legislation, sponsored by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Democrat Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, for some time.",
      "The bill has overwhelming support in the Senate, but Republican leadership has been waiting for Trump to give the green light before moving ahead with it. The White House had expressed some reservations about the legislation.",

    "story": [
      "One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the shooter's motive is still unclear. It may stay that way, said Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican from Kentucky who also chairs the Senate committee that released its final report Sunday detailing what it characterized as failures by the U.S. Secret Service that allowed the attempt to happen.",
      "\"I think we aren't going to know the motive, and I take that at face value,\" Paul told \"Face the Nation\" moderator Margaret Brennan, adding that despite his own personal doubts over government transparency in other scenarios, he believes \"they've tried their best\" in this case.",
      "\"I don't think there's an answer that they're not revealing to us,\" the senator said. \"I think they just don't know.\"",
      "A 20-year-old gunman opened fire on Mr. Trump during his Butler rally on July 13, 2024, shooting into the crowd of attendees from the rooftop of a nearby building. A bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear, but he was otherwise not harmed. Two attendees were critically wounded, and one, Corey Comperatore, died from his injuries.",
      "The gunman, Thomas Crooks, was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper stationed at the event. Afterward, the agency faced a litany of criticisms and multiple formal investigations into its practices as many questioned how Crooks could come so close to carrying out the assassination successfully and ultimately charged the Secret Service with enabling the attack.",
      "In its latest report on the matter, the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, of which Paul serves as chairman, accused the Secret Service of \"inexcusable negligence, communication breakdowns, systemic weaknesses, and limited accountability.\"",
      "The report found that the Secret Service \"denied or left unfulfilled at least 10 requests\" from Mr. Trump's security detail to provide additional resources for his protection during his 2024 presidential campaign. Some of the requests included a stronger counter drone system, counter assault team and counter snipers on the premises, according to the report.",
      "Paul cited the results of several investigations, including the one conducted by his committee, which found that the gunman was seen more than 90 minutes before the shooting and operated a drone, undetected, hours earlier.",
      "\"Three minutes before the shooting, the crowd is chanting, man on a roof, man on a roof,\" Paul said. The senator noted that additional time passed as Crooks assembled his gun, yet Mr. Trump was not advised to move from the stage where he was giving a campaign speech, something Paul called \"inexcusable, terrible security.\"",
      "Although little direct evidence exists as to why Crooks wanted to shoot Mr. Trump, who was the Republican presidential candidate at the time, documents reviewed by CBS News in May offered some insights into the gunman's mind.",
      "The documents included emails, personal essays and other academic records, which showed Crooks to be a conscientious and intelligent college student with an interest in engineering as well as a clear skepticism of the federal government and corporations.",
      "In one essay, Crooks praised George Orwell's \"Shooting an Elephant,\" widely considered a metaphor for western colonialism, as \"a powerful allegory warning against adopting imperialistic policies.\"",
      "He wrote about Mr. Trump in his coursework at least once, criticizing a decision made during his first term in another essay that touched on the spread of nuclear weapons. Crooks also wrote at least once about former President Joe Biden, reviewing a 2021 opinion piece in the Washington Post, which he said persuasively argued against Biden's position on free tuition for community college.",

      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Sunday that \"a turning point regarding Russia invasion of Ukraine is coming\" amid a bipartisan effort in Congress to impose new economic sanctions aimed at ramping up pressure on the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"For months, President Trump has tried to entice [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to the peace table. He's put tariffs against countries that allow fentanyl to come in our country, other bad behavior \u2014 he's left the door open regarding Russia. That door is about to close,\" Graham said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Graham outlined that he and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" are leading 85 cosponsors on a sanctions bill that he said would make a \"sledgehammer available to President Trump to go after Putin's economy and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine.\"",
      "The South Carolina Republican explained that countries like China, India and Brazil buy oil and other goods from Russia, saying \"that's the money Putin uses to prosecute the war.\" Graham said the sanctions package would give the president the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia. And he noted that the president would have the discretion to dial the tariffs up or down, giving him \"maximum flexibility.\"",
      "\"We're going after the people who keep Putin in business, and additional sanctions on Russia itself,\" Graham said. \"This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.\"",
      "Graham introduced the legislation in April, gaining momentum in recent weeks as Mr. Trump expressed frustration with Putin.",
      "After a call with the Russian leader earlier this month, Mr. Trump told reporters he was \"very disappointed\" and \"didn't make any progress.\" And Mr. Trump said last week that his administration would send more defensive weapons to Ukraine days after some weapons shipments were paused, as Russia pounded Ukraine with drone and missile attacks in what Ukraine described as the largest such attacks since the invasion began in February 2022.",
      "\"Putin is not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting. \"So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I've approved that.\"",
      "The president also said during the Cabinet meeting that he is \"very strongly\" considering the sanctions bill.",
      "The measure appeared sidelined in recent weeks amid other priorities in Congress and as the White House sought changes to the measure that would grant more flexibility to the president on imposing the sanctions. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that GOP leaders have made \"substantial progress\" on the legislation, and he forecasted that the measure could be ready for consideration on the Senate floor as early as this work period, which ends Aug. 1.",
      "Graham and Blumenthal met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Europe late last week. The Ukrainian president praised the sanctions bill in a post on X after the meeting, saying \"Without a doubt, this is exactly the kind of leverage that can bring peace closer and make sure diplomacy is not empty.\"",
      "Blumenthal said Sunday that European leaders are \"absolutely in solidarity\" with the U.S. on the sanctions, saying \"bringing down this sledgehammer at this moment was emphasized by all of the European allies who were at the meeting that Sen. Graham and I attended in Europe.\"",
      "The Connecticut Democrat added that the language on the president's waiver authority in the legislation is similar to previous measures, allowing the president to act while also providing congressional oversight. He called the assurance \"very important\" to his Democratic colleagues.",
      "\"What is most important, I think, at this moment, is our unity,\" Blumenthal said. \"Sen. Graham and I, Republican and Democrat, coming together, the European leaders with diverse views, also in unity.\"",
      "The comments come as Mr. Trump is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since he took office in January, multiple diplomatic sources told CBS News. Asked about additional U.S. support for Ukraine, Graham teased an announcement the president is expected to make on Russia Monday, adding that \"the idea of America selling weapons to help Ukraine is very much in play.\"",
      "\"We've given Ukraine a lot,\" Graham said. \"We've given the money. We've given them military aid. We now have a minerals agreement with Ukraine that's worth trillions of dollars. So I don't want to get ahead of the president, but stay tuned about seized assets.\"",
      "Blumenthal also said Europeans leaders are making a plan to access at least part of the seized assets from Russia, noting that the $5 billion that the U.S. has seized could also be accessed. \"I think it's time to do it,\" Blumenthal said.",
      "Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" spearheaded legislation during the Biden administration giving the president authority to seize foreign assets. And although consensus couldn't previously be reached on the move, Hill said now is the time to act.",
      "\"I think it's time for the president to convert those seized assets to a trust account for the benefit of Ukraine,\" Hill said.",
      "No American president has ever seized the sovereign central bank assets of a country that the U.S. is not at war with. Former U.S. officials told CBS that the Biden administration declined to use that authority because of European opposition related to the unintended consequences on their own banking systems and economy that might result from seizing those state assets.",
      "Graham said he expects in the coming days \"you will see weapons flowing at a record level to help Ukraine defend themselves,\" along with new tariffs and sanctions available to Mr. Trump and more support from Europe.",
      "\"Putin made a miscalculation here,\" Graham said. \"For six months, President Trump tried to entice Putin to the table. The attacks have gone up, not down. One of the biggest miscalculations Putin has made is to play Trump.\"",

      "Ahead of the assassination attempt one year ago on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service denied multiple requests from Mr. Trump's Secret Service detail to bolster his security apparatus during his 2024 presidential campaign, according to a Senate report released Sunday.",
      "The report from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs found that the Secret Service \"denied or left unfulfilled at least 10 requests\" from Mr. Trump's detail for \"additional resources,\" including an enhanced counter drone system, counter assault team personnel and counter snipers.",
      "On July 13, 2024, a 20-year-old gunman opened fire on Mr. Trump from the rooftop of a nearby building during a campaign rally in Butler. The president was grazed in the ear by one of the bullets, while one rallygoer was killed and two others were critically wounded in the shooting. The gunman, Thomas Crooks, was shot and killed by a Secret Service sniper. The incident prompted several investigations into the Secret Service's practices and protocols.",
      "In an interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, called the Secret Service's reaction to the shooting a \"cascade of errors.\"",
      "Paul said he believed there is a \"cultural cover-up\" within the Secret Service, and said he believed that there wouldn't have been any discipline within the agency if he hadn't subpoenaed their records.",
      "\"This report reveals a disturbing pattern of communication failures and negligence that culminated in a preventable tragedy,\" Paul, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security Committee, wrote in the report. \"What happened was inexcusable and the consequences imposed for the failures so far do not reflect the severity of the situation.\"",
      "The report accuses then-Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle of \"falsely\" testifying to Congress that \"no USSS asset requests were denied for the Butler rally.\" Cheatle resigned nearly a year ago after testifying before Congress.",
      "In response to the report, Cheatle said in a statement that while she agrees that \"mistakes were made and reform is needed,\" she said \"that fateful day was a perfect storm of events.\"",
      "\"At the time I provided my congressional testimony, ten days after the assassination attempt, the information provided to me by personnel from Headquarters and the Trump detail, to include the current agency Director, confirmed my statement that no requests for additional support had been denied to our agents at Butler,\" she said. \"Any assertion or implication that I provided misleading testimony is patently false and does a disservice to those men and women on the front lines who have been unfairly disciplined for a team, rather than individual, failure.\"",
      "Richard Giuditta Jr., chief counsel to the Secret Service, told the committee that there was no evidence that \"political animus\" was behind the denials, the report reads.",
      "Specifically concerning the Butler rally, the committee did not find that there was an \"explicit denial\" for enhanced counter drone systems. However, in a transcribed interview to the committee, a Secret Service counter-unmanned aircraft systems agent alleged that such a request was denied via phone by a Secret Service technical security division advance agent, the report states.",
      "That denial was corroborated by Secret Service documents, the report found.",
      "This would appear to contradict previous testimony from then-Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe, who had replaced Cheatle in the post.\u00a0During a contentious July 30, 2024, hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Judiciary committees, Rowe testified that \"all assets requested were approved\" for the Butler rally.",
      "Rowe, however, also testified regarding requests for assets other than Butler: \"There are times when assets were unavailable and not able to be filled, and those gaps were staffed with state and local law enforcement tactical assets.\"",
      "Furthermore, the new report found that, prior to the Butler shooting, the Secret Service had no formal process for submitting resource requests, and \"therefore there was no standard response concerning approvals or denials of such requests from USSS Headquarters.\"",
      "Documents obtained by the committee \"revealed a pattern of certain categories of requests being either blatantly denied, unfulfilled, or required to be supplemented by local law enforcement or other federal agencies,\" the report said.",
      "In a statement, Secret Service director Sean Curran said the agency \"took a serious look at our operations and implemented substantive reforms to address the failures that occurred that day.\"",
      "A \"lack of structured communication was likely the greatest contributor to the failures\" of the Secret Service at Butler, the report stated, echoing a previous 180-page House report released\u00a0last December on the assassination attempt which found that there was \"fragmented communications\" at Butler because local law enforcement and the Secret Service had separate command posts.",
      "According to the Senate committee's findings, the Secret Service agent tasked with leading communications at Butler \u2014 a role known as the \"security room agent\" \u2014 was the special agent in charge of the Secret Service's Buffalo, New York, field office, and was assigned the Butler role on July 11, 2024, only two days before the rally.",
      "That agent \"only discovered the existence of the second command post\" after he overheard conversations between a Pennsylvania State Police officer who was stationed in the Secret Service's command post, and other law enforcement.",
      "\"By his own admission, he never had direct contact with local law enforcement throughout the day, and that his only method of communication with them was through the PSP officer in the USSS Security Room,\" the report said of the security room agent.",
      "The report also addressed the announcement this week that six Secret Service personnel\u00a0were suspended following an internal investigation into the Butler shooting response. The six personnel were issued suspensions without pay or benefits ranging from 10 to 42 days.",
      "However, the Senate committee's investigation found that the security room agent at Butler was not among those disciplined, even though, the report writes, \"according to testimony and documents received by the committee,\" he \"failed to relay critical information he obtained from\" the Pennsylvania State Police officer stationed in the Secret Service's command post \"regarding a suspicious individual with a range finder\" to the Secret Service agents \"who could have removed or prevented President Trump from taking the stage.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, U.S. Secret Service Director Sean Curran said that his agency had received the report \"and will continue to work cooperatively with the committee as we move forward in our mission.\"",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: One year ago today, a shooter in Butler, Pennsylvania, killed one man and nearly assassinated Donald Trump. We will have a look at the new findings on what went wrong in an exclusive interview with the Senate chairman behind it.",
      "There are still questions about what motivated the shooter at that Trump rally in Butler and also the miscommunication and poor planning on the part of the Secret Service and other law enforcement agencies.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): There were mistakes made and that shouldn't have happened. But I was satisfied in terms of the bigger plot, the larger plot. I was satisfied.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Rand Paul, joins us with the conclusions from his new report.",
      "In Texas, the grueling task of cleanup and recovery continues 10 days after massive flooding killed at least 129 people, with dozens more still missing. Was it a preventable tragedy? We will talk with Washington's Maria Cantwell.",
      "With Russian attacks on Ukraine intensifying and the president's increasing annoyance with Vladimir Putin, we will get an update from the two senators pushing for punishing sanctions on Russia, South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham and Connecticut Democrat Richard Blumenthal.",
      "Finally, House Financial Services Committee Chairman French Hill will be here to talk about his plans to make the complicated world of cryptocurrency go mainstream.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot to get to this morning.",
      "So, let's begin with Senator Lindsey Graham in Clemson, South Carolina, and Senator Richard Blumenthal in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They both just returned from Europe, where they met with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy.",
      "Good morning to you both, Senators.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL (D-Connecticut): Good morning.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, I want to start with you.",
      "Russia is escalating. They're not ending this war in Ukraine.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina): Yes, right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: NATO's Secretary-General is going to be here in Washington this week, and will be meeting with President Trump, who is, according to our reporting, considering fresh funding for Ukraine.",
      "That would be the first time since he's taken office. What do you know about what is coming?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I don't want to get ahead of the president, but I'm having dinner, along with Senator Blumenthal and other senators, with Secretary-General Mark Rutte tomorrow night.",
      "A turning point regarding Russia invasion of Ukraine is coming. For months, President Trump has tried to entice Putin to the peace table. He's put tariffs against countries that allow fentanyl to come in our country, other bad behavior. He's left the door open regarding Russia. That door is about to close.",
      "Dick and I have got 85 co-sponsors in the United States Senate for congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer available to President Trump to go after Putin's economy and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine. China, India, and Brazil buy oil and petroleum products and other goods from Russia. That's the money Putin uses to prosecute the war.",
      "And this congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500 percent tariffs on any country that helps Russia and props up Putin's war machine. He can dial it up or down. He can go to zero, to 500. He has maximum flexibility.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, on those sanctions, the president said he expects the Senate to pass this measure you put together. And he described being able to terminate it \"as totally at my option. It very respectfully lets the president do whatever he wants\" and decide whether or not to exercise it.",
      "I know that has raised some concerns among your fellow Democrats, like Senators Kaine and Senator Coons. How do you assure them that this is as tough as you promise?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: This has to be a critical moment for these sanctions. And bringing down this sledgehammer at this moment was emphasized by all of the European allies who were at the meeting that Senator Graham and I attended in Europe.",
      "They are absolutely in solidarity. One after another in that closed-door setting expressed the view that these sanctions have to be tough and rigorous to change behavior.",
      "And so the waiver language that we will have in this bill is very much alike the provisions that have existed in past similar measures that give the president the ability to act in the national security, but also provide congressional oversight. And I think that kind of assurance to my Democratic colleagues is very important.",
      "But what is most important, I think, at this moment, is our unity. Senator Graham and I, Republican and Democrat, coming together, the European leaders with diverse views, also in unity. And we want to make use of the seized assets, again, in a unified way.",
      "I think a multifaceted approach here is the only way to bring Putin to the table, because he's a thug. He understands only force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to follow up on that, the \u2013 the seized assets, there's, what, $300 billion in Europe. There's about $5 billion here in the United States. Do you get the sense that the president is going to be willing to tap that and that the European leaders are going to be willing to seize and use that money?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Part of the plan that I think will be sought in this meeting involving the secretary-general is for Ukraine to be given assets by NATO and their purchasing those military assets from the United States.",
      "But the seized property, the seized assets from Russia, can be accessed by the Europeans. They are devising a plan to do it, at least for a part of those assets, billions of dollars, and the interest that is derived from them, very, very important resources for Ukraine. And the $5 billion that the United States has also could be accessed, and I think it's time to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be talking to one of the congressmen who put together that law to be able to seize those assets later in the program.",
      "Senator Graham, I want to ask you, on the battlefield and when it comes to weapons, CBS' Jim LaPorta has learned, a recent defense intelligence assessment shows Ukraine's shortfall in artillery and in drones will lead to marked Russian territorial gains in 2026, with Russia gaining 7-1 firepower superiority by this winter.",
      "How can you get them what they need if Congress will not approve in the House any new funding? Is it what Senator Blumenthal just laid out?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, just stay tuned for tomorrow's announcement.",
      "The idea of America selling weapons to help Ukraine is very much in play. We've given Ukraine a lot. We have given them money. We give them military aid. We now have a minerals agreement with Ukraine that's worth trillions of dollars. So, I don't want to get ahead of the president, but stay tuned about seized assets.",
      "The Europeans want to limit the interest on the assets to go to Ukraine. Secretary Bessent wants to go further. Stay tuned about a plan to go after the seized assets more aggressively. Stay tuned for a plan where America will begin to sell to our European allies tremendous amounts of weapons that can benefit Ukraine.",
      "Putin has calculated that we would get tired and Europe would get weary. He made a huge mistake. NATO is bigger and stronger, and we're more committed to ever to make sure he does not take Ukraine by force. So, Congress is on the verge of passing the most consequential sanction package in the history of the \u2013 of the country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: It will give President Trump tools he doesn't have today, a literal sledgehammer. And the big offenders here is China, India, and Brazil. India buys oil from Russia cheap and resells it. That's despicable.",
      "I am \u2013 I have talked to President Trump. He said last week, it's time to move. He's tried to entice Putin to the table. But my goal is to end this war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And the only way you're going to end this war is to get people who prop up Putin, make them choose between the American economy and helping Putin. And you can only have one negotiator, and that's going to be President Trump, with maximum flexibility to end this war.",
      "China, India, and Brazil, you're about to get hurt big time if you keep helping Putin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator, respectfully, the president's rhetoric has changed this week on Russia. He is making clear his patience is very thin.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he's got right now at his fingertips\u2026",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 just short of $4 billion in presidential drawdown authority. He doesn't need to ask Congress. He doesn't need to ask the Europeans for that money. He's got it if he wants to tap it.",
      "Wouldn't it be a stronger sign if he just sent those weapons or surged them?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well \u2013 well, the $4 billion is not nearly enough. I expect him to exercise that drawdown authority.",
      "But the game regarding Putin's invasion of Russia is about to change. I expect, in the coming days, you will see weapons flowing at a record level to help Ukraine defend themselves. I expect in the coming days that there will be tariffs and sanctions available to President Trump he has never had before.",
      "I expect in the coming days more support from Europe regarding their efforts to help Ukraine. Putin made a miscalculation here. For six months, President Trump tried to entice Putin to the table. The attacks have gone up, not down. One of the biggest miscalculations Putin has made is to play Trump.",
      "And you just watch. In the coming days and weeks, there's going to be a massive effort to get Putin to the table. And to those who are helping him, China, buying cheap Russian oil and having no accountability, those days are about over.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, on \u2013 on Ukraine, North Korea has been sending troops, as you know, to fight for Russia in Ukraine. Russia's top diplomat was just meeting with Kim Jong-un.",
      "We know that the missile technology Russia is providing them is sort of their payment for sending bodies to fight. Is that going to make a measurable difference in the North Korean nuclear program? Is there more of a threat today to the U.S. because of it?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: The threat of cooperation on that score, in sending missile technology to North Korea, as well as support for Iran that potentially could come from Russia, is a major piece of evidence why we need to be strong with our allies against this axis.",
      "It still exists. The success against Iran's nuclear program ought not to make us complacent about the dangers of proliferating nuclear arms. And, absolutely, yes, we should be coming down stronger, not only on Russia, but North Korea.",
      "And our plan has to be to deter this kind of nuclear arms cooperation, which is why our working with our allies is so important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: As they went around the room, these are the major European leaders, all of them, assembled together last Thursday in Rome, thanking us for being there, Senator Graham and myself, and General Kellogg representing Trump.",
      "This moment of unity must be seized, and the timing is absolutely critical. President Zelenskyy has been robust and stalwart, but his people are being killed by bombs and drones, children kidnapped. We need to really express the strength of the United States, because only strength can get Putin to the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, on another topic here, you have been an advocate for the allies of the United States who were left behind in Afghanistan following that chaotic 2021 withdrawal by the last administration.",
      "On Friday, the State Department laid off the personnel in the department that helps place those refugees and other allies in the United States. Two sources with direct knowledge told CBS that there are about 1,400 Afghan allies with connections to the Pentagon, with connections to U.S. intelligence, and they're stuck there.",
      "They don't know what's happening next. Can you stop them from being sent back to the Taliban?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, I don't think there's any desire by anybody to send people who helped us in Afghanistan back to the Taliban control. That's not going to happen.",
      "As to trimming up the State Department, if you're telling me we can't reduce the number of people working in the State Department and still run it effectively, I don't buy that. We can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013 well, there are some questions about who's going to actually help prevent them from going back to Afghanistan, which is why I was asking you that if you're going to advocate on their behalf.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, you sit on the Judiciary Committee, I believe.",
      "CBS has reported yesterday that the attorney general, Pam Bondi, fired 20 DOJ employees who worked on the classified documents cases and the January 6 investigations. There are more firings expected. These are career officers and lawyers who don't pick their assignments. They're handed out to them.",
      "Is there anything that Congress can do to protect some of these civil servants?",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Margaret, that's a really important question, because Pam Bondi has so politicized and weaponized the Department of Justice, and now firing these career professionals who have devoted their lives to the Department of Justice, it's only one facet of the continuing politicization.",
      "And, yes, Congress ought to be investigating. The Judiciary Committee ought to begin right away its inquiry. But I'm calling for an inspector general investigation, not only of these firings, but also of the dropping of a prosecution into the Utah physician who was mid-trial on charges of conspiracy, fraud against the government in connection with a COVID vaccine scheme, apparently at the behest of politicians who were deeply angry about the MAGA issue there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: And I believe strongly that now Congress must investigate.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, do you want to quickly respond to those allegations of politicized handling up at the Justice Department?",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, you all missed a lot.",
      "The Justice Department was used to destroy President Trump, his family, and tried to change the election by bringing a bunch of B.S. charges against him for years. We're going to clean that mess up. As to Pam Bondi, I have all the confidence in the world she will do her job. And if somebody has been terminated, they have rights under civil service law to say it was wrongfully done.",
      "But I'm almost amused at the idea that people are now suddenly worried about politicization of the Justice Department, while everybody sat quiet for all those years. Literally, the Justice Department under Biden tried to change\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: \u2026 the election by prosecuting Trump based on a bunch of B.S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are mass firings, which is why I was asking you about them, sir.",
      "Senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview\u2026",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 up until that last section.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Appreciate it.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Well, we're so used\u2026",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Senator Maria Cantwell, who is the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, which has oversight of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, and the National Weather Service.",
      "Good morning, Senator.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL (D-Washington): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These agencies are being looked at carefully right now, as you know.",
      "Just this morning in Texas, we are seeing the National Weather Service issue another flash flood warning for that very same part of Central Texas, Kerrville. In fact, the ground search for victims had to be halted because of this warning.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: There's been so much scrutiny of what went wrong or what more could have been done. In your view, at the federal level, is the National Weather Service doing everything it should be doing?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: You mean at this moment? At this moment\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did it function as intended?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, I think what \u2013 what's happening here \u2013 and we need to take a pause. Glad the president and first lady went. And, definitely, there's a lot of things being said.",
      "But what the real question is, is, what can we do to improve the weather forecasting of this nation, to use science, to use better assets, to really do a once-in-a-lifetime investment to upgrade the system so that we could have given people in Kerrville a \u2013 more time, more warning? And the same for tornadoes and hurricanes and fires.",
      "And so I think what we're learning is that, in this last week, we've had four events that have all broken huge records for weather and precipitation. That means more flooding. So we know now we're having more extreme weather. What is our response to that to make sure we never have another Kerrville again?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, more extreme weather, more stresses on the system.",
      "At the same time, you have the Trump administration at least proposing that they're going to do a 27 percent budget cut to NOAA. The commerce secretary, though, said he's not going to touch public forecasting.",
      "We've seen, though, on the Democratic side, Leader Schumer say there should be an investigation about whether staff cuts, for example, led to or contributed to the Texas disaster. Are Democrats being too quick here to blame the politics?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: You know, I liked your\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: I liked your opening story about the GAO report and saw what my colleagues presented. You know, I was on that call the day the president was shot and basic \u2013 shot, and bas\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about Butler.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: In Butler.",
      "And I basically asked the question on the call that day, did you guys use drones? There was like dead silence.",
      "So I'm glad now that GAO, a respected arm of our organization and government, is producing a report. Do you want the same kind of report a year from now? Yes. What we want is to make sure that we understand what happened. But doing blame gaming isn't going to bring people back.",
      "But the press has every right to ask hard questions to try to figure out, what \u2013 what do we need to do to improve weather forecasting? So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask that because the DNC and Democratic leaders have said things like this. You're talking in substantial, specific\u2026",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Yes, yes. And let\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 policy language. That's not what's coming from leadership. That's why I'm asking.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, what's important to know is that, in this particular storm, what we had is very warm surface conditions in the Gulf.",
      "We had \u2013 that meant the storm was going to move slower. It meant it was going to drop more precipitation. We as a nation shouldn't be second to Europe or anybody in being a weather-ready nation. We should be the smartest government in the world, using technology, analyzing the data and putting a forecast system into place that gives people that kind of system.",
      "So, just recently, in \u2013 in the Midwest, that work by NOAA and the weather forecasting system and the labs helped give information about how to get out of the way of a tornado two hours in advance, not 15 minutes or 13 minutes, but two hours.",
      "And I'm going to send a letter to the president making five recommendations, and some of them are very bipartisan recommendations, things that Senator Cruz or Wicker or Moran support, that basically make this once-in-a-lifetime investment, so we have the best information, the best analysis, the best people to interpret that on the ground for the local responders.",
      "And let's help Americans get out of the way of a storm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, on that point, in your recommendations, we are still seeing a proposed budget cut, we are still seeing staff cuts, and the administration is talking about privatizing parts of NOAA.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you do all of that and then accomplish the outcome you're asking for?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, I think that's what we're going to try to draw attention to.",
      "Senator Cruz and I both support upgrading our Doppler radar system. That is having a system that gives you more information about what the storm is likely to do. It's one of the reasons why Europe is a little ahead of us and you hear about their forecasting system is because they do more analytics around data that give them higher predictability.",
      "I think we're in the same place. Let's get the best system in the country. Senator Wicker and I support these ocean buoys. Those buoys tell you the temperature of the ocean. Why was that so important in this case? Because you needed to know. That temperature tells you how \u2013 how much that storm might move or hold in a pattern and how much precipitation it might move forward and dump in a community.",
      "So\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you believe this has to happen at the federal level? It's not a state-led response in that way \u2013 or forecasting, rather?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Well, this is \u2013 this is a national responsibility.",
      "And I think of, you know, if you want your snow shoveled, yes, you want the mayor to show up.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: But if you want accurate weather information, it's not community to community. It's a national system. And we share that with the local people and help them best respond.",
      "And, today, my state has a red flag warning out. It's right on the \u2013 in \"The Seattle Times,\" telling the whole state, very bad conditions today, very hot temperatures, very high winds. That means a fire could be explosive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, so a lot of warning ahead of time.",
      "Let's talk more about this on the other side of this break.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Stay with us, if you will.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If you're looking for more Face the Nation, including extended interviews and special content, you can visit our YouTube page.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We returned to our conversation with Senator Maria Cantwell.",
      "Just to pick up where we left off in talking about how to at least warn people further in advance of potential weather related disasters, you know, there is still no Senate confirmed head of NOAA. You did go through with a hearing on the committee very recently. And the nominee, Dr. Jacobs, told you that the main mission will still be preserved under this administration. Do you feel comfortable in the potential leadership of Dr. Jacobs? Will you vote to confirm?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL (D-WA): I haven't decided yet. I \u2013 I have to see, for the record. He did say some very positive things that he wanted a NOAA organic (ph) act. He wants the weather act that Senator Cruz and I have proposed. He said he wanted some other resources there.",
      "I've got to drill down on exactly what he things is going to happen on the science mission and how we're going to preserve that because the nation is now spending billions of dollars on storms. In fact, Susan Collins and I had a report from GAO a few \u2013 in the last year that showed how much we were spending on the impacts of \u2013 of climate and extreme weather. So, the point is, it's a minuscule investment to keep some of these science research functions at NOAA to help them better prepare people for hurricanes, for tornadoes and floods. It's a minuscule amount of money.",
      "And so we want to be smarter about it. And the more you can move people and resources out of the way of a storm, the more you can predict what might happen, the better prepared we're going to be. And that's going to help us save lives and certainly save dollars.",
      "So, I want to \u2013 I want to get from him exactly how he thinks that this is \u2013 is going to work. But he did say some positive things about the structure. People don't understand, but NOAA is really a science arm of our government to make all of this for the nation and the Weather Service. So, they literally have to fund the hurricane hunters. Those are the planes that fly into a hurricane.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: And we've helped support that in the past in a bipartisan way. It basically funds these \u2013 the research that really, I think, probably where Europe is right now is they just do better analysis of the data.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: They're not doing anything extraordinarily better than us. They're probably just spending more time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: And if that is a few million dollars and supercomputing time, we should do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaking of Europe and the trade conversation the president has renewed just on Saturday, saying he's going to put tariffs on the European Union and up them on \u2013 on Mexico as well by August the 1st.",
      "You know, there's been a lot of concern about what it would do to the economy. The stock market seems to be brushing off the impact.",
      "Out in your state, Boeing, a huge contributor to the U.S. economy, is headquartered there. In fact, they had a 27 percent increase of airplane deliveries in June, eight to China because there's been this sort of cooling off with them.",
      "If that's on the back burner, are you less concerned about the trade war?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Oh, no, no. No. No, I'm \u2013 I'm very concerned we're in a endless summer of trade war tariffs and chaos. I'm very concerned about this. It is impacting our businesses. We are one of the most trade - dependent states in the nation. But it's impacting our ports. I mean, literally, trade with our ports is, you know, at least 20 percent down over last year, in the month of May, from the previous year.",
      "The Association of Washington business is releasing a study that they've previewed with us. And of their membership, 75 percent of them have said they already are impacted by the tariffs. About \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These are like medium-sized businesses or \u2013",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Yes, there are probably a few would define as \u2013 as large, but they're \u2013 they're saying that \u2013 30 percent of them are saying that they basically have already raised costs in \u2013 in some way. And 15 percent of them said, we've either laid off people or are planning to lay of people in the future.",
      "So, for us, we are seeing the economic impacts of this and our competitiveness, even though people have planned with storing a lot of material, you know, getting supplies in, trying to prepare for this, this up and down, you know, is really having an effect on costs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, for \u2013 it sounds like you're saying at this point, we haven't yet seen fully or felt fully the economic impact. So, for the market to be betting that the president is either going to back down or that this isn't as hurtful as some predicted, you're saying, just wait and see?",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Oh, I think the market has been very clear. When he says he's going forward with tariffs, they don't like it, and you see a drop.",
      "And \u2013 and \u2013 and \u2013 and when he takes a pause that \u2013 but that's not the issue. The issue is small business. We have \u2013 you know, 75 percent of jobs are created by small businesses. And those small businesses don't have the same flexibility that a big company does \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: To move out of the way of a supply chain that is now being disrupted or, you know, there was a Japanese company, a big supplier to U.S. auto manufacturing, that went out of business. So, we now have aluminum prices that affects everything from our transportation infrastructure investment, to, you know, I \u2013 I heard on Amazon that tea kettles went up, you know, like 40 or 50 percent in cost.",
      "So, it's affecting all sorts of products.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: And, you know, while we may not see all of that at this moment, I guarantee you, as the next quarter results come in, I'm sure we will see some effects of these tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: So, let's get back to using our alliances to create",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: You know, why aren't we working with Europe right now to counter, you know, Russia \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Instead of being in an argument with them on some of these issues that could be resolved in a different form.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see if an agreement is reached before August the 1st.",
      "Senator, thank you very much for joining g us today.",
      "SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back with more FACE THE NATION.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the chair of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky.",
      "Good morning to your, Senator.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL (R-KY): Thank you. Thank you for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Today is that one year mark since then candidate Trump was shot at in Butler, Pennsylvania. You have released an accountability report. We've had a look at it. And it details that assets were requested by the Secret Service, including requests made over the phone, and they were denied. You also say that the former Secret Service director made false claims under oath when Kimberly Cheatle said there were no denials. Was she misled or are you accusing her of lying?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: She did not tell the truth. She said that there were no assets that were requested in advance. We found at least four occasions, actually maybe five occasions where requests were made.",
      "The primary request that was made by both Trump's Secret Service detail, as well as his campaign, was for counter snipers. Counter snipers were denied until Butler. So, thank God, on that day, in Butler County, Pennsylvania, that was the first time he was allowed counter snipers. If he had not had counter snipers, that assassin would have popped up again \u2013 he did pop up again to continue firing, and that's when he was taken out. But thank God we had the counter snipers there. But why were they denied for months and months. When they finally did ask for them, they mysteriously, magically appeared. They found them where they needed. They just weren't trying hard enough.",
      "So, it was a cascade of errors. It was just one error after another. When we talk to the people in charge of security, everybody pointed a finger at someone else. We said, who is responsible for the roof? The roof where the assassin lay with a direct sight line. Nobody wanted responsibility. Everybody said it was somebody else. There was plenty of time to take him off the stage. The suspicious person with a range finder who because the shooter, many times he was spotted by police with suspicion. That should have been enough to take the president off the stage.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Even with him on the roof, there was about a three- minute period when he could have been taken on the stage, and yet no one was fired. Some of these people could be in charge of security for another presidential candidate. And really that's a danger that some one \u2013 someone of the people that were in charge at Butler could be in charge again. That's not right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013 well, the president of the United States has said he is satisfied with the answers he's received in regard to what went wrong. But back on the point about not telling the truth to Congress. The report found that there were 10 occasions where resources were requested or denied or not filled. And, in fact, when it came to Butler, the countersurveillance drone request was made over the phone.",
      "So, when you say someone is not telling the truth, is it that there was no record of request and denials? Was this knowingly misleading Congress? Or was this like a culture of cover-up within the agency?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I think it was a cultural cover-up for the agency. They did not want to assess blame. They did not want to look internally. And they wanted to discount any of their actions that might have led to this. This was a cover your ass sort of moment. And I do believe that they did know. There's no way that the director of Secret Service, that she did not know that these requests had been made.",
      "And so, yes, it was a huge failure. And if you talk to the current head of the Secret Service, who is Trump's lead detail, and Trump has a great deal of confidence in, he'll admit that these failures existed.",
      "But even the disciplinary action that they finally took, they only took because I subpoenaed. I wanted to know, who is disciplined. We weren't going to release the names. But I wanted to know, who was disciplined and what the discipline was. They refused for a year to tell me that. They told me that a week ago. You saw the news reports.",
      "But some of the people were just disciplined two weeks ago. So, they weren't going to discipline anybody until I subpoenaed and asked them what they had done. But, in the end, no one was fired.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: And the supervisor who heard about the person on the roof, who did not tell the detail immediately to take the president off the stage, there was a several minute delay there, he stayed in his job. He did retire recently, but stayed in his job.",
      "So, no, I think even the investigation by the Secret Service was inadequate. But that's why we need to have congressional oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to request that all \u2013 all requests for assets be made in writing and not over the phone so people can deny that they were ever asked for help?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Yes, I think they were made in writing as well. And I think some were made by phone. But I think the ones that were made by phone were following up on things they made in writing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Got it.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Somebody was just begging for \u2013 for assets.",
      "And think about it. President Trump has had extraordinary rallies. No matter what political perspective you come from, he has extraordinary rallies which have ordinary risk. Much better \u2013 much greater risk than having, you know, 200 people in an auditorium where everybody's thoroughly screened and the location is secure. These things really take a lot of detail. But when we ask the Secret Service, who was in charge of the roof? How could you walk through at 3:00 in the afternoon and see the roof? Nobody walked through. Nobody was in charge. Everybody said, oh, she was in charge of the roof, or he was in charge of the roof. No one would actually admit to being in charge of security for Butler.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, they're \u2013 the \u2013 the big, beautiful bill that the president asked for gives $1.2 billion to the Secret Service. Does money fix that? And what do you say to the family member of \u2013 of the gentleman killed that day? Are we ever going to know the motive of the shooter?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I think we aren't going to know the motive. And I take that at face value. I know a lot of times, when we don't get something and we suspect something, we think government's lying to us.",
      "And, look, I have my doubts about government on many levels. But I think, on this level, they've tried their best. And I don't think there's a secret answer that they're not revealing to us. I think they just don't know.",
      "What we do know is the failures in security and that Corey Comperatore could have possibly been saved by having better security that day. And this boy was seen four hours before the shooting. He was seen again 45 minutes before. Three minutes before the crowd, the crowd is chanting, \"man on a roof, man on a roof.\" Forty-five seconds to go as he's assembling his gun. Forty-five seconds is a long time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: Nobody told them to take the president off the stage. Inexcusable, terrible security. But whoever is in charge should have been fired and really should never be in charge of this type of \u2013 or have this type of responsibility again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the question of forewarning, but on a different topic, this Friday is the deadline for both the Senate and House to vote on a plan to claw back about $9 billion for foreign aid, including also support for NPR and PBS. Some of your fellow Republicans, like Rounds, like Murkowski and Collins have said they are worried about cuts to local radio and public broadcasters in their areas. We looked, and in your state of Kentucky, public broadcasters provide critical emergency warnings for the government. If there's a storm, for example.",
      "Are you concerned that these kind of cuts are going to endanger people?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: You know, I got my start on public television, KET, in Kentucky, being a commentator for my tax payer group that I started. So, you know, I am not an enemy of public TV. But at the same time, we have a $2 trillion deficit. And what we'll be presented with is a $9 billion cut in spending. And, can we and should we at least start cutting $9 billion, yes. If I had my druthers and I could plan it and I could present the package, I like the idea of across- the-board cuts of a smaller percentage. So, instead of taking 100 percent of public TV, what you do is you take 6 percent of everything.",
      "But the only way that works is you literally have to take 6 percent of every dollar, and then you have to figure out how to make it work so it's not absorbed by the poor or the needy in our country. And you could do that. With a penny plan, you can balance your budget within six \u2013 within five years. But it takes a real 6 percent cut of everything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: But I think people are more willing to accept a haircut on things they like if everybody is accepting the same sort of level of cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, are you saying there that you are still going to vote for this? Are there 51 Republicans who are going to vote to cut all this funding and pull it back?",
      "SENATOR RAND PAUL: I suspect it's going to be very close. I don't know if it will be modified in advance. But I cannot really honestly look Americans in the face and say that I'm going to be doing something about the deficit if I can't cut 9 billion. Even though there are people who make arguments for it, and I can make an argument for a different way to cut it, we're going to be presented with a $9 billion cut and a $2.2 trillion deficit. So, we have to cut spending. We absolutely have to cut spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a \u2013 and a record boost to the debt ceiling that just happening in the bill you did not vote for, but Republicans did.",
      "Senator Paul, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Congressman French Hill. He is the chair of the House Financial Services Committee.",
      "Welcome back to the broadcast.",
      "Your ears must have been ringing with the two senators who started the program because they were talking about grabbing some of those frozen Russian assets. You moved a bill and gave the president authority to actually seize them during the last administration under the Repo Act. The U.S. has never before seized central bank assets from another country.",
      "Do you know of the Treasury Department is going to do so now?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL (R-AR): Well, Margaret, it's good to be with you.",
      "Yes, I certainly worked very hard with former Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul and others to put that in our 2024 national security package during the Biden administration because we wanted another arrow in the quiver for the president to not just seize those assets, but to convert them to the benefit of Ukraine, but we could never get consensus between the United States and Europe for doing that, despite a unanimous vote of the council - - the parliamentary assembly of the council of Europe supporting it.",
      "So, I continued to urge President Biden to do that. We got the interest of those frozen assets to benefit Ukraine. But I think it's time for the president to convert those seized assets to a trust account for the benefit of Ukraine. I'm glad to hear both Senators Blumenthal and Graham support that idea. It's time to do it. And I've encouraged Secretary Bessent that this should be a priority for President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On another topic, because you have some oversight in the financial space, I want to ask you about comments made in regard to Fed Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "The president says the economy is in good shape, but he still complains about the \u2013 the head of the central bank. Says he's doing a terrible job because he's not lowering interest rates.",
      "On another network today, the president's top economic advisor said the White House is looking into whether the president has the authority to fire Chair Powell. Do you believe the president has the power and authority to fire the Fed president?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: You know, Margaret, I don't. And I believe President Trump has spoken about this several times over the past two years, including recently. Mr. Powell's governorship, his chairmanship, is up next spring. The president has vacancies coming up on the Fed board, where he could name another governor.",
      "But, look, just because Congress created the Fed and the \u2013 we believe that it should be independent in the setting of monetary policy, it doesn't mean that it's immune from criticism. And every president since World War II has had choice words for the Fed chair when they've not been in sync with the direction of the president.",
      "And so, look, Congress continues to do oversight. I set up a special task force to oversee the Fed's decision-making since the 2008 financial crisis. We have the investigation review and oversight underway. And we'll continue it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you'd acknowledge that most presidents might have had those choice words behind closed doors, not on social media posts, on a regular basis, Congressman.",
      "But on crypto, I want to as you, crypto has been the wild west, right, in many ways because they don't have the same kind of regulation in the digital asset space that there does exist for banks and financial services. You've got a few measures coming up this week. How do you make sure, as you put these regulations in place that kind of help crypto become more mainstream, that it doesn't also benefit some of those on the black market, for example, who use this to evade oversight?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Exactly. Well, in the work in the Senate, led by Bill Haggerty and Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis on the Genius Act, to create a dollar-backed stable coin, we've heavily influenced that legislation over the two years of previous work by the House. In our Clarity Act, which sets up the rules of the road for what's a commodity, what's a security, how to use digital assets, how to store them, how to (INAUDIBLE) them, these are the rules that will protect consumers. We'll limit access to our market and our investors from entities outside the United States trying to influence the crypto market. We have none of that today.",
      "What we've had is a mismatch of rules by enforcement in the Biden administration. And I believe the bills we'll have on the House floor this week will protect investors, consumers and make American, as President Trump wants, a leader in financial technology and crypto and digital assets innovation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, you know, sir, that the concern is that this is the patina of protection of consumers without actual muscle behind it. It was interesting to see, and many Americans who hold mortgages might have noticed, that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, who buy and sell mortgages, that the head of the agency, the Federal Housing Agency, Bill Pulte, told them, they'll have to prepare a proposal to review crypto as an asset on mortgage applications. Given the huge taxpayer stake in \u2013 in \u2013 in Fannie and Freddie, are you comfortable with people using crypto, something that isn't really, you know, tangible in many ways to pay for a down payment on a house?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, look at bitcoin, for example. One can now buy bitcoin. It is a commodity. It's been determined that it's a commodity by the CFTC and the SEC. One can hold it in their brokerage account through an exchange traded products, an ETF, ETP. It's now an asset for millions of Americans. And it certainly could be treated like a stock or a bond or cash as a contribution to someone's net worth to qualify for a mortgage.",
      "An if we pass Clarity this week, which I expect we will on a bipartisan basis, and we craft a dollar back stable coin, like Genius, offered by Senator Haggerty, we'll have the rules of the road. It won't be a patina of consumer enforcement, it will be real consumer enforcement, investor protections, both by the CFTC, the SEC and the bank \u2013 and the bank regulators.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a down payment for a house.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, look, again, bitcoin is an asset. You can determine if you think it's going to go up in value or down in value, just like stocks and bonds, or other investments that people have on their financial statement to secure their financial statement for a net \u2013 for net worth purposes, or to liquidate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: In the \u2013 for a \u2013 a down payment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: So, I think it's a financial asset. Our bill will make it a more secure world \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And one that's better for, I think, all households and businesses.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm out of time so I'm going to have to leave it there.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Thank you. Thank you for having",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Today is the one-year mark since then-candidate Trump was shot at in Butler, Pennsylvania. You have released an Accountability Report, we've had a look at it, and it details that assets were requested by the Secret Service, including requests made over the phone, and they were denied. You also say that the former Secret Service director made false claims under oath when Kimberly Cheadle said there were no denials. Was she misled, or are you accusing her of lying?",
      "SEN. PAUL: She did not tell the truth. She said that there were no assets that were requested in advance. We found at least four occasions, actually, maybe five occasions, where requests were made. The primary request that was made by both Trump's Secret Service detail, as well as his campaign was for counter-snipers. Counter-snipers were denied until Butler. So, thank God, on that day in Butler County, Pennsylvania, that was the first time he was allowed counter-snipers. If he had not had counter-snipers, that assassin would have popped up again- he did pop up again to continue firing, and that's when he was taken out. But, thank God we had the counter-snipers there. But why were they denied for months and months? When they finally did ask for them, they mysteriously, magically appeared. They found them where they needed them. They just weren't trying hard enough. So, it was a cascade of errors. It was just one error after another. When we talked to the people in charge of security, everybody pointed a finger at someone else. We said, who was responsible for that roof, the roof where the assassin lay with a direct sight line. Nobody wanted responsibility. Everybody said it was somebody else. There was plenty of time to take him off the stage. The suspicious person with the range finder who became the shooter, many times he was spotted by police with suspicion. That should have been enough to take the president off the stage. Even with him on the roof, there was about a three-minute period when he could have been taken from the stage. And yet, no one was fired. Some of these people could be in charge of security for another presidential candidate. And, really, that's a danger that someone- one of the people that were in charge at Butler, could be in charge again. That's not right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President United States has said he is satisfied with the answers he's received in regard to what went wrong. But, back on the point about not telling the truth to Congress: The report found that there were 10 occasions where resources were requested and denied or not filled. And, in fact, when it came to Butler, the counter-surveillance drone request was made over the phone. So, when you say someone is not telling the truth, is it that there was no record of requests and denials? Was this knowingly misleading Congress? Or was this like a culture of cover-up within the agency?",
      "SEN. PAUL \u00a0I think it was a cultural cover-up for the agency. They did not want to assess blame. They did not want to look internally. And they wanted to discount any of their actions that might have led to this. This was a cover your ass sort of moment, and I do believe that they did know. There's no way that the director of Secret Service, that she did not know that these requests had been made. And, so, yes, it was a huge failure. And, if you talk to the current head of the Secret Service, who was Trump's lead detail, and Trump has a great deal of confidence in, he'll admit that these failures existed. But even the disciplinary action that they finally took. They only took because I subpoenaed. I wanted to know who was disciplined. We weren't going to release the names, but I wanted to know who was disciplined and what the discipline was. They refused for a year to tell me that. They told me that a week ago, you saw the news reports, but some of the people were just disciplined two weeks ago, so they weren't going to discipline anybody until I subpoenaed and asked them what they had done. But, in the end, no one was fired. The supervisor who heard about the person on the roof, who did not tell the detail immediately to take the president off the stage, there was a several-minute delay there. He stayed in his job. He did retire recently, but stayed in his job. So, no, I think even the investigation by the Secret Service was inadequate. But that's why we need to have congressional oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to request that all, all requests for assets be made in writing and not over the phone, so people can deny that they were ever asked for help?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Yeah, I think they were made in writing as well, and I think some were made by phone, but I think the ones that made by phone were following up on things they made in writing. Somebody was just begging for assets. And think about it, President Trump has had extraordinary rallies, no matter what political perspective you come from, he has extraordinary rallies which have extraordinary risk, much better, much greater risk than having, you know, 200 people in an auditorium where everybody's thoroughly screened and the location is secure. These things really take a lot of detail. But we asked the Secret Service who was in charge of that roof? How could you walk through it three o'clock in the afternoon and see that roof? Nobody walked through. Nobody was in charge. Everybody said, oh, she was in charge of the roof or he was in charge of the roof. No one would actually admit to be in charge of security for Butler.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there, the big, beautiful bill that the president asked for gives $1.2 billion to the Secret Service. Does money fix that? And what do you say to the family member of the gentleman killed that day? Are we ever going to know the motive of the shooter?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: You know, I think we aren't going to know the motive, and I take that at face value. I know a lot of times when we don't get something and we suspect something, we think government's lying to us. And look, I have my doubts about government on many levels, but I think on this level, they've tried their best and I don't think there's a secret answer that they're not revealing to us. I think they just don't know. What we do know is the failures in security, and that the Corey Comperatore could have possibly been saved by having better security that day. And this boy was seen four hours before the shooting. He was seen again 45 minutes before. Three minutes before the shooting the crowd is chanting, man on a roof, man on a roof. 45 seconds to go as he's assembling his gun. 45 seconds is a long time. Nobody told them to take the president off the stage. Inexcusable, terrible security, but whoever is in charge should have been fired, and really should never be in charge of this type of, or have this type of responsibility again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the question of forewarning, but on a different topic. This Friday is the deadline for both the Senate and House to vote on a plan to claw back about $9 billion for foreign aid, including also support for NPR and PBS. Some of your fellow Republicans, like Rounds like Murkowski and Collins, have said they are worried about cuts to local radio and public broadcasters in their areas. We looked and in your state of Kentucky, public broadcasters provide critical emergency warnings for the government if there's a storm, for example. Are you concerned that these kind of cuts are going to endanger people?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: You know, I got my start on public television, KET in Kentucky, being a commentator for my taxpayer group that I started. So, you know, I am not an enemy of public TV, but at the same time we have a $2 trillion deficit, and what we'll be presented with is a $9 billion cut in spending. And can we, and should we at least start cutting 9 billion? Yes, if I had my druthers and I could plan it, and I could present the package, I like the idea of across the board cuts of a smaller percentage. So instead of taking 100% of public TV, what you do is you take 6% of everything. But the only way that works is you literally have to take 6% of every dollar, and then you have to figure out how to make it work so it's not absorbed by the poor or the needy in our country. And you could do that. With a penny plan, you can balance your budget within six, within five years, but it takes a real 6% cut of everything. But I think people are more willing to accept a haircut on things they like if everybody is accepting the same sort of level of cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you saying there that you are still going to vote for this? Are there 51 Republicans who are going to vote to cut all this funding and pull it back?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I suspect it's going to be very close. I don't know if it will be modified in advance, but I can't really honestly look Americans in the face and say that I'm going to be doing something about the deficit if I can't cut 9 billion. Even though there are people who make arguments for it, and I can make an argument for a different way to cut it, we're going to be presented with a $9 billion cut and a $2.2 trillion deficit. So we have to cut spending. Absolutely have to cut spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a record boost to the debt ceiling that just happened in the bill you did not vote for, but Republicans did. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Senator Maria Cantwell, who is the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, which has oversight of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, and the National Weather Service. Good morning, Senator.",
      "SEN. MARIA CANTWELL: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These agencies are being looked at carefully right now, as you know. Just this morning in Texas, we are seeing the National Weather Service issue another flash flood warning for that very same part of Central Texas, Kerrville. In fact, the ground search for victims had to be halted because of this warning. There's been so much scrutiny of what went wrong or what more could have been done. In your view, at the federal level, is the National Weather Service doing everything it should be doing?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL:\u00a0 You mean at this moment?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yes, did it function as intended?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, I think what- what's happening here, and we need to take a pause. Glad the president and first lady went, and definitely there's a lot of things being said, but what the real question is, is what can we do to improve the weather forecasting of this nation? To use science, to use better assets, to really do a once in a lifetime investment to upgrade the system so that we could have given people in Kerrville a- more time, more warning and the same for tornadoes and hurricanes and fires. And so I think what we're learning is that in this last week, we've had four events that have all broken huge records for weather and precipitation. That means more flooding. So we know now we're having more extreme weather. What is our response to that to make sure we never have another Kerrville again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So more extreme weather, more stress is on the system. At the same time, you have the Trump administration at least proposing that they're going to do a 27% budget cut to NOAA. The Commerce Secretary, though, said he's not going to touch public for- forecasting. We've seen, though, on the Democratic side, Leader Schumer say there should be an investigation about whether staff cuts, for example, led to or contributed to the Texas disaster. Are Democrats being too quick here to blame the politics?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: You know, I liked your--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: I liked your opening story about the GAO report and saw what my colleagues presented. You know, I was on that call the day the President was shot and base- shot and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about Butler.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: In Butler. And I basically asked the question on the call that day, did you guys use drones? There was like dead silence. So I'm glad now that GAO, a respected arm of our organization and government, is producing a report. Do you want the same kind of report a year from now? Yes. What we want is to make sure that we understand what happened, but doing blame gaming isn't going to bring people back. But the press has every right to ask hard questions to try to figure out what- what do we need to do to improve weather forecasting, to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask that because the DNC and Democratic leaders have said things like this, you're talking in substantial, specific--",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Yes, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --policy language. That's not what's coming from leadership. That's why I'm asking.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, what's important to know is that in this particular storm, what we had is very warm surface conditions in the Gulf. We had- that meant the storm was going to move slower. It meant it was going to drop more precipitation. We as a nation shouldn't be second to Europe or anybody in being a weather-ready nation. We should be the smartest government in the world, using technology, analyzing the data and putting a forecast system into place that gives people that kind of system. So just recently, in- in the Midwest, that work by NOAA and the weather forecasting system and the labs helped give information about how to get out of the way of a tornado two hours in advance, not 15 minutes or 13 minutes, but two hours. And I'm going to send a letter to the President making five recommendations, and some of them are very bipartisan recommendations, things that Senator Cruz or Wicker or Moran support, that basically make this once in a lifetime investment. So we have the best information, the best analysis, the best people to interpret that on the ground for the local responders and let's help Americans get out of the way of a storm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, in your recommendations, we are still seeing a proposed budget cut, we are still seeing staff cuts, and the administration is talking about privatizing parts of NOAA.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Yup.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you do all of that and then accomplish the outcome you're asking for?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, I think that's what we're going to try to draw attention to. Senator Cruz and I both support upgrading our Doppler radar system. That is having a system that gives you more information about what the storm is likely to do. It's one of the reasons why Europe is a little ahead of us, and you hear about their forecasting system, is because they do more analytics around data that give them higher predictability. I think we're in the same place. Let's get the best system in the country. Senator Wicker and I support these ocean buoys. Those buoys tell you the temperature of the ocean. Why was that so important in this case? Because you needed to know, that temperature tells you how- how much that storm might move or hold in a pattern, and how much precipitation it might move forward and dump in a community. So--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And so believe this has to happen at the federal level? It's not a state-led response in that way, or forecasting rather.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, this is- this is a national responsibility. And I think of, you know, if you want your snow shoveled, yeah, you want the mayor to show up, but if you want accurate weather information, it's not community to community. It's a national system, and we share that with the local people and help them best respond. And today, my state has a red flag warning out right on the- in the Seattle Times, telling the whole state very bad conditions today, very hot temperatures, very high winds. That means a fire could be explosive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So a lot of warning ahead of time. Let's talk more about this on the other side of this break. Stay with us, if you will. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with Senator Maria Cantwell. Just to pick up where we left off in talking about how to, at least, warn people further in advance of potential weather-related disasters. You know, there is still no Senate confirmed head of NOAA. You did go through with a hearing on the committee very recently. And the nominee, Dr. Jacobs, told you that the main mission will still be preserved under this administration. Do you feel comfortable in the potential leadership of Dr. Jacobs? Will you vote to confirm him?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: I haven't decided yet, I have to see. For the record, he did say some very positive things that he wanted a NOAA Organic Act. He wants the Weather Act that Senator Cruz and I have proposed. He said he wanted some other resources there. I gotta drill down on exactly what he thinks is going to happen on the science mission and how we're going to preserve that, because the nation is now spending billions of dollars on storms. In fact, Susan Collins and I had a report from GAO a few- in the last year that showed how much we were spending on the impacts of- of climate and extreme weather. So the point is, it's a minuscule investment to keep some of the science research functions at NOAA to help them better prepare people for hurricanes, for tornadoes and floods. It's a minuscule amount of money. And so we want to be smarter about it, and the more you can move people and resources out of the way of a storm, the more you can predict what might happen, the better prepared we're going to be, and that's going to help us save lives and certainly save dollars. So I want to- I want to get from him exactly how he thinks that this is going to work. But he did say some positive things about the structure. People don't understand, but NOAA is really a science arm of our government to make all of this for the nation and the weather service. So they literally have to fund the hurricane hunters, those are the planes that fly into a hurricane, and we've helped support that in the past in a bipartisan way. It basically funds these- the research that really- I think probably where Europe is right now is they just do better analysis of the data. They're not doing anything extraordinarily better than us. They're probably just spending more time. And if that is a few million dollars and supercomputing time, we should do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaking of Europe and the trade conversation the President has renewed just on Saturday, saying he's going to put tariffs on the European Union, and up them on- on Mexico as well, by August 1st. You know, there's been a lot of concern about what it would do to the economy. The stock market seems to be brushing off the impact. Out in your state, Boeing, huge contributor to the U.S. economy, is headquartered there. In fact, they had a 27% increase in airplane deliveries in June. Eight to China, because there's been this sort of cooling off with them. If that's on the back burner, are you less concerned about the trade war?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Oh no, no, no, no. I'm very concerned we're in an endless summer of trade war, tariffs and chaos. I'm very concerned about this. It is impacting our businesses. We are one of the most trade dependent states in the nation, but it's impacting our ports. I mean literally, trade with our ports is, you know, at least 20% down over last year, the month of May from the previous year. The Association of Washington Businesses is releasing a study that they've previewed with us, and of their membership, 75% of them have said they already are impacted by the tariffs. About--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are medium sized businesses, or--",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Yes, there are- probably a few would define as large. But they're saying that- 30% of them are saying that they basically have already raised costs in some way, and 15% of them said we've either laid off people or are planning to lay off people in the future. So for us, we are seeing the economic impacts of this and our competitiveness, even though people have planned with storing a lot of material, you know, getting supplies in, trying to prepare for this, this up and down, you know, is really having an effect on costs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you're saying at this point, we haven't yet seen fully or felt fully the economic impact. So for the market to be betting that the President is either going to back down or that this isn't as hurtful as some predicted, you're saying just wait and see.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Oh, I think the market has been very clear. When he says he's going forward with tariffs, they don't like it, and you see a drop and- and- when he takes a pause- But that's not the issue. The issue is small businesses. We have- you know, 75% of jobs are created by small businesses, and those small businesses don't have the same flexibility that a big company does to move out of the way of a supply chain that is now being disrupted. Or, you know, there was a Japanese company, big supplier to U.S. auto manufacturers, that went out of business. So we now have aluminum prices that affects everything from our transportation infrastructure investment to- you know, I heard on Amazon that tea kettles went up, you know, like 40 or 50% in cost. So it's affecting all sorts of products. And, you know, while we may not see all of that at this moment, I guarantee you, as the next quarter results come in, I'm sure we will see some effects of these tariffs. So let's get back to using our alliances to create- you know, why aren't we working with Europe right now to counter, you know, Russia, instead of being in an argument with them on some of these issues that could be resolved in a different form.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see if an agreement is reached before August the 1st. Senator, thank you very much--",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --for joining us today. We'll be right back with more Face the Nation.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot to get to this morning. So, let's begin with Senator Lindsey Graham in Clemson, South Carolina, and Senator Richard Blumenthal in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They both just returned from Europe, where they met with Ukrainian President Zelensky. Good morning to you both, Senators.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Good morning.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good Morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, I want to start with you. Russia is escalating. They're not ending this war in Ukraine. NATO's Secretary General is going to be here, in Washington, this week and will be meeting with President Trump, who is, according to our reporting, considering fresh funding for Ukraine. That would be the first time since he's taken office. What do you know about what is coming?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I don't want to get ahead of the President, but I'm having dinner, along with Senator Blumenthal and other senators, with Secretary General Mark Rutte, tomorrow night. A turning point regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine is coming. For months, President Trump has tried to entice Putin to the peace table. He's put tariffs against countries that allow fentanyl to come in our country. Other bad behavior. He's left the door open regarding Russia. That door is about to close. Dick and I have got 85 co-sponsors in the United States Senate for congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer available to President Trump to go after Putin's economy, and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine. China, India, and Brazil buy oil and petroleum products and other goods from Russia. That's the money Putin uses to prosecute the war. And this congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia, and props up Putin's war machine. He can dial it up or down. He can go to 0%, to 500%. He has maximum flexibility. But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, on those sanctions, the President said he expects the Senate to pass this measure you put together. And he described being able to terminate it as totally at my option. It, very respectfully, lets the President do whatever he wants, and decide whether or not to exercise it. I know that has raised some concerns among your fellow Democrats, like Senators Kane and Senator Coons. How do you assure them that this is as tough as you promise?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: This has to be a critical moment for these sanctions and bringing down this sledgehammer at this moment was emphasized by all of the European allies who were at the meeting that Senator Graham and I attended in Europe. They are absolutely in solidarity. One after another, in that closed-door setting, expressed the view that the sanctions have to be tough and rigorous to change behavior. And so, the waiver language that we will have in this bill is very much alike the provisions that have existed in past, similar measures that give the President the ability to act in the national security, but also provide congressional oversight. And, I think that kind of assurance to my Democratic colleagues is very important. But, what is most important, I think, at this moment, is our unity. Senator Graham and I, Republican and Democrat, coming together, the European leaders with diverse views, also in unity. And we want to make use of the seized assets, again, in a unified way. I think a multi-faceted approach here is the only way to bring Putin to the table, because he's a thug. He understands only force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to follow up on that, the- the seized assets. There's what, $300 billion in Europe. There's about $5 billion here, in the United States. Do you get the sense that the President is going to be willing to tap that, and that the European leaders are going to be willing to seize and use that money?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Part of the plan that I think will be sought in this meeting involving the Secretary General is for Ukraine to be given assets by NATO and their purchasing those military assets from the United States. But the seized property, the seized assets from Russia, can be accessed by the Europeans. They are devising a plan to do it, at least for a part of those assets, billions of dollars, and the interest that is derived from them. Very, very important resources for Ukraine. And the $5 billion that the United States has also could be accessed, and I think it's time to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be talking to one of the congressmen who put together that law to be able to seize those assets later in the program. Senator Graham, I want to ask you on the battlefield, and when it comes to weapons. CBS' Jim Laporta has learned a recent defense intelligence assessment shows Ukraine's shortfall in artillery and in drones will lead to marked Russian territorial gains in 2026, with Russia gaining seven to one firepower superiority by this winter. How can you get them what they need if Congress will not approve, in the House, any new funding? Is it what Senator Blumenthal just laid out?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well, just stay tuned for tomorrow's announcement. The idea of America selling weapons to help Ukraine is very much in play. We've given Ukraine a lot. We give them the money, we give them military aid. We now have a minerals agreement with Ukraine that's worth trillions of dollars. So, I don't want to get ahead of the President, but stay tuned about seized assets. The Europeans want to limit the interest on the assets to go to Ukraine. Secretary Bessent wants to go further. Stay tuned about a plan to go after the seized assets more aggressively. Stay tuned for a plan where America will begin to sell to our European allies tremendous amounts of weapons that can benefit Ukraine. Putin has calculated that we would get tired, and Europe would get weary. He made a huge mistake. NATO is bigger and stronger, and we're more committed to ever to make sure he does not take Ukraine by force. So, Congress is on the verge of passing the most consequential sanction package in the history of the- of the country. It will give President Trump tools he doesn't have today, a literal sledgehammer. And the big offenders here is China, India, and Brazil. India buys oil from Russia cheap and resells it. That's despicable. I've talked to President Trump. He said last week, it's time to move. He's tried to entice Putin to the table. But my goal is to end this war, and the only way you're going to end this war is to get people who prop up Putin make them choose between the American economy and helping Putin. And you can only have one negotiator, and that's going to be President Trump, with maximum flexibility to end this war. China, India, and Brazil, you're about to get hurt big time if you keep helping Putin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Senator, respectfully, the President's rhetoric has changed this week on Russia. He is making clear his patience is very thin. But, he's got, right now, at his fingertips, just short of $4 billion in presidential drawdown authority. He doesn't need to ask Congress. He doesn't need to ask the Europeans for that money. He's got it if he wants to tap it. Wouldn't it be a stronger sign if he just sent those weapons or surged them?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well, the $4 billion and not nearly enough. I expect him to exercise that draw-down authority. But the game, regarding Putin's invasion of Russia, is about to change. I expect, in the coming days, you will see weapons flowing at a record level to help Ukraine defend themselves. I expect, in the coming days, that there will be tariffs and sanctions available to President Trump he has never had before. I expect, in the coming days, more support from Europe regarding the efforts to help Ukraine. Putin made a miscalculation here. For six months, President Trump tried to entice Putin to the table. The attacks have gone up, not down. One of the biggest miscalculations Putin has made is to play Trump. And you just watch, in the coming days and weeks, there's going to be a massive effort to get Putin to the table. And to those who are helping him, China, buying cheap Russian oil and having no accountability, those days are about over.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, on- on Ukraine, North Korea has been sending troops, as you know, to fight for Russia in Ukraine. Russia's top diplomat was just meeting with Kim Jong Un. We know that the missile technology Russia is providing them is, sort of, their payment for sending bodies to fight. Is that going to make a measurable difference in the North Korean nuclear program? Is there more of a threat today to the US because of it?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: The threat of cooperation on that score in sending missile technology to North Korea, as well as support for Iran, that potentially could come from Russia, is a major piece of evidence why we need to be strong with our allies against this axis. It still exists. The success against Iran's nuclear program ought not to make us complacent about the dangers of proliferating nuclear arms. And, absolutely, yes, we should be coming down stronger, not only on Russia but North Korea, and our plan has to be to deter this kind of nuclear arms cooperation, which is why our working with our allies is so important. As they went around the room, these are the major European leaders, all of them, assembled together last Thursday in Rome, thanking us for being there, Senator Graham and myself, and General Kellogg, representing Trump. This moment of unity must be seized, and the timing is absolutely critical. President Zelensky has been robust and stalwart, but his people are being killed by bombs and drones. Children kidnapped. We need to, really, express the strength of the United States, because only strength can get Putin to the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, on another topic here, you have been an advocate for the allies of the United States who were left behind in Afghanistan following that chaotic 2021 withdrawal by the last administration. On Friday, the State Department laid off the personnel in the department that helps place those refugees and other allies in the United States. Two sources with direct knowledge told CBS that there are about 1,400 Afghan allies with connections to the Pentagon, with connections to US intelligence, and they're stuck there. They don't know what's happening next. Can you stop them from being sent back to the Taliban?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I don't think there's any desire by anybody to send people who helped us in Afghanistan back to the Taliban control. That's not going to happen. As to trimming up the State Department, if you're telling me we can't reduce the number of people working in the State Department and still run it effectively, I don't buy that. We can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are some questions about who's going to actually help prevent them from going back to Afghanistan, which is why I was asking you that if you're going to advocate on their behalf. Senator Blumenthal, you sit on the Judiciary Committee, I believe. CBS has reported yesterday that the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, fired 20 DOJ employees who worked on the classified documents cases and the January 6 investigations. There are more firings expected. These are career officers and lawyers who don't pick their assignments. They're handed out to them. Is there anything that Congress can do to protect some of these civil servants?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Margaret, that's a really important question, because Pam Bondi has so politicized, and weaponized the Department of Justice and now firing these career professionals who have devoted their lives to the Department of Justice, it's only one facet of the continuing politicization. And, yes, Congress ought to be investigating. The Judiciary Committee ought to begin, right away, its inquiry. But, I'm calling for an Inspector General investigation, not only of these firings, but also of the dropping of a prosecution into the Utah physician who was mid-trial on charges of conspiracy, fraud against the government, in connection with a COVID vaccine scheme, apparently, at the behest of politicians who were deeply angry about the MAGA issue there. And, I believe strongly that now Congress must investigate",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, do you want to quickly respond to those allegations of politicized handling up at the Justice Department?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, y'all missed a lot. The Justice Department was used to destroy President Trump, his family, and tried to change the election by bringing a bunch of B-S charges against him for years. We're going to clean that mess up. As to Pam Bondi, I have all the confidence in the world she will do her job. And if somebody has been terminated, they have rights under civil service law to say it was wrongfully done. But, I'm almost amused at the idea that people are now suddenly worried about politicization of the Justice Department, while everybody sat quiet for all those years. Literally, the Justice Department, under Biden, tried to change the election by prosecuting Trump based on a bunch of B-S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are mass firings, which is why I was asking you about them, sir. Senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview, up until that last section. Appreciate it. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell said Sunday the federal government must take responsibility for investigating the breakdown in flood warnings during the recent deadly storms in Texas, calling it a \"national responsibility\" to improve forecasting systems and prevent future disasters.",
      "\"It's not community to community. It's a national system,\" said Cantwell on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And we share that with local people to help them best respond.\"",
      "Since the July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, officials have confirmed at least 129 people are dead and more than 170 remain missing as of Sunday morning. Over the weekend, search and recovery efforts were temporarily halted for the first time due to new flood threats, as additional rain and rising water levels prompted fresh warnings from the National Weather Service.",
      "The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said Sunday that she plans to send a letter to President Trump outlining bipartisan recommendations to upgrade the country's forecasting infrastructure. Among them are improvements to Doppler radar, increased use of ocean buoys to track sea temperatures, and enhanced data analytics and computing power for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "\"What the real question is, is what can we do to improve the weather forecasting of this nation,\" Cantwell said. \"To use science, to use better assets, to really do a once in a lifetime investment to upgrade the system.\"",
      "She pointed to more accurate tornado forecasts in the Midwest \u2013 where residents received two hours of warning \u2013 as evidence that federal investment in weather science can save lives.",
      "\"We should be the smartest government in the world using technology, analyzing the data, and putting a forecast system into place that gives people that kind of system,\" she said.",
      "The senator also warned against proposed budget cuts and privatization efforts under the Trump administration, which she said could undermine NOAA's mission. During the Texas floods, key forecasting and IT positions at the National Weather Service were unfulfilled, according to the union that represents NWS staffers. The vacancies raise questions about whether staffing shortages may have contributed to delays in emergency alerts.",
      "But Cantwell said \"it's a miniscule amount of money\" compared to the cost of disaster recovery, and she added\u00a0 that small businesses and first responders rely on government-issued alerts.",
      "Cantwell said she hasn't decided whether she will vote to confirm NOAA administrator nominee Dr. Neil Jacobs. The senator said she was pleased in a Senate hearing this week that Jacobs made \"some very positive\" commitments about supporting the Organic Act, which is aimed at establishing the NOAA as an independent agency. Before making a decision, Cantwell said she wants to \"drill down\" on Jacobs' thoughts about how to preserve the science mission amid increased spending on storms.",

    "story": [
      "The Justice Department and FBI are struggling to contain the fallout from this week's decision to withhold records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation, which rankled influential far-right media personalities and supporters of President Trump.",
      "The move, which included the acknowledgment that one particular sought-after document never actually existed, sparked a contentious conversation between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino at the White House this week. The spat threatened to shatter relations between them and centered in part on a news story that described divisions between the FBI and the Justice Department.",
      "The cascade of disappointment and disbelief arising from the refusal to disclose additional, much-hyped records from the Epstein investigation underscores the struggles of FBI and Justice Department leaders to resolve the conspiracy theories and amped-up expectations that they themselves had stoked with claims of a cover-up and hidden evidence. Infuriated by the failure of officials to unlock, as promised, the secrets of the so-called \"deep state,\" Trump supporters on the far right have grown restless and even demanded change at the top.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed frustration in a lengthy social media posting on Saturday over the divide among diehards of his \"Make America Great Again\" movement over the matter, and expressed support for Bondi. His lengthy post made no mention of Bongino.",
      "\"What's going on with my 'boys' and, in some cases, 'gals?'\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening.\"",
      "He later said: \"One year ago our Country was DEAD, now it's the 'HOTTEST' Country anywhere in the World. Let's keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\"",
      "Tensions that simmered for months boiled over on Monday when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement saying that they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a \"client list,\" even though Bondi had intimated in February that such a document was sitting on her desk, and had decided against releasing any additional records from the investigation.",
      "The department did disclose a video meant to prove that Epstein killed himself in jail, but even that raised the eyebrows of conspiracy theorists because of a missing minute in the recording.",
      "It was hardly the first time that Trump administration officials have failed to fulfill their pledge to deliver the evidence that supporters had come to expect.",
      "In February, conservative influencers were invited to the White House and provided with binders marked \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" and \"Declassified.\" But the binders contained information that had largely already been in the public domain.",
      "Afterward, Bondi said an FBI \"source\" informed her of the existence of thousands of pages of previously undisclosed documents and ordered the bureau to provide the \"full and complete Epstein files.\" She later said officials were poring over a \"truckload\" of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI.",
      "But after a months-long review of evidence in the government's possession, the Justice Department determined in the memo Monday that no \"further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\" The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims, and \"only a fraction\" of it \"would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.\"",
      "The Trump administration had hoped that that statement would be the final word on the saga, with Mr. Trump chiding a reporter who asked Bondi about the Epstein case at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.",
      "However, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News that Bondi and Bongino got into a confrontation over the public rollout of the Epstein review during a White House meeting Wednesday. Also in the meeting was White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "Bongino did not show up to work on Friday, according to the sources.",
      "The news publication Axios was first to describe the conversation.",
      "Also Friday, far-right activist Laura Loomer, who is close to Mr. Trump, posted on X that she was told that Bongino was \"seriously thinking about resigning\" and had taken the day off to contemplate his future. Bongino is normally an active presence on social media but has been silent since Wednesday.",
      "The FBI did not respond to a request seeking comment, and the White House sought in a statement to minimize any tensions.",
      "\"President Trump has assembled a highly qualified and experienced law and order team dedicated to protecting Americans, holding criminals accountable, and delivering justice to victims,\" said spokesman Harrison Fields. \"This work is being carried out seamlessly and with unity.

The layoffs, called a reduction-in-force, or RIF, have been expected for months. Officials sent a reorganization plan to Congress in March, signaling the cuts. The Trump administration says the cuts are necessary to remove redundant offices and focus the department on its core responsibilities.",
      "Critics argue the cuts could undermine the State Department's work. All Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee penned a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday denouncing the RIFs.",
      "\"During a time of increasingly complex and wide-spread challenges to U.S. national security, this administration should be strengthening our diplomatic corps\u2014an irreplaceable instrument of U.S. power and leadership\u2014not weakening it,\" the senators wrote. \"However, RIFs would severely undermine the Department's ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy interests, putting our nation's security, strength, and prosperity at risk.\"",
      "Foreign service officers who received RIF notices will be separated in 120 days, the notice sent to employees said, while civil service officers will be separated in 60 days.",
      "The long-planned layoffs are taking place days after the Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration's sweeping plans to slash the size of the government workforce, pausing a lower court order that halted layoff plans at dozens of federal agencies.",
      "Department staff were informed of the impending reduction-in-force plans in a Thursday afternoon message from Deputy Secretary of State Michael Rigas, who thanked departing staff \"for their dedication and service to the United States.\" Two sources familiar with the matter said RIF notices started going out to affected employees on a rolling basis on Friday morning. The department previously told reporters it plans to conduct the reductions-in-force over the course of a single day.",
      "Some employees were told that due to the anticipated RIF, they would not be permitted to telework on Friday, and should report to work with all department-issued equipment, including laptops, telephones, diplomatic passports, travel cards and any other property owned by the State Department. An email with these instructions told staff that badges would be collected during \"out processing,\" and to ensure that any personal items be collected before that time.",
      "Signs were spotted in some State Department bathrooms Friday urging remaining staff to \"resist fascism\" and \"remember the oath you vowed to uphold.\"",
      "Layoffs hit human rights, refugee-focused departments",
      "Many of the reductions-in-force hit offices that were slated for elimination or cuts, including ones that focus on refugees, human rights and foreign assistance.",
      "The cuts included nearly all civil service officers in the Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration's office of admissions, which handles the program that resettles refugees in the U.S., according to two sources familiar. The move came as a surprise to staffers because the office had been handling a program to resettle Afrikaners from South Africa, a White House priority.",
      "The Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor's entire global programs office, which handles foreign assistance, was also let go. The office has 391 active grants, a source told CBS News. Staff were not told what will happen to those programs, but a source notes the money was already congressionally mandated. The bureau's office of multilateral and global affairs was also eliminated.",
      "Meanwhile, all leadership team members of the State Department's Coordinator for Afghan Relocation Efforts (CARE) office, which has relocated nearly 200,000 Afghan allies and family members since 2021, also received reduction-in-force notices, according to the group AfghanEvac. In a press release, the organization says that among those affected by the RIFs was a woman who gave birth to her first child just 12 hours before receiving the news.",
      "There are still about 1,400 Afghan refugees or special immigrant visa holders at a U.S. military base in Doha, Qatar, a former U.S. official and a Capitol Hill source familiar told CBS News Saturday.",
      "Some of those stuck on the U.S. base hold special immigrant visas (SIVs) and are thus exempted from the Trump administration's executive order restricting refugee admissions. But they await processing to the U.S.",
      "However, according to the former U.S. official, the majority of those left are classified as refugees and it is unclear whether the Trump administration will allow them into the U.S. despite their ties to U.S. intelligence and military personnel.",
      "The Capitol Hill source told CBS News that it is likely that many of the Afghans will be forced to go back to Afghanistan unless Mr. Trump lifts the travel restrictions on Afghanistan or ends his suspension of the refugee program. Another option would be if they were to qualify for a limited number of SIVs.",
      "The Afghans cannot leave the base in Qatar without U.S. authorization and thus are dependent on the U.S. facilitating their movement.",
      "CARE was established in the wake of the chaotic 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan as the Taliban took control of the country.",
      "One laid-off employee was Jose Mercado, who had worked at the agency for 29 years and served as deputy director of the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor's office of western hemisphere affairs. He told CBS News it was a \"sad day for foreign policy.\"",
      "\"It's a sad day for human rights in the world. This did not make us stronger, this made us weaker,\" Mercado said. \"We will come back. We will improve. This is going to be better. But right now, we're not in the best position when it comes to foreign policy.\"",
      "Members of the Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs faced reductions-in-force, including press officers, two sources familiar told CBS News.",
      "And an office that handled organizing Rubio's trip to Malaysia for the ASEAN Summit was eliminated, with its Civil Service employees receiving reduction-in-force notices \u2014 as the secretary was en route back from the summit. That department is the office of multilateral affairs in the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, according to two sources familiar.",
      "Sweeping State Department reorganization",
      "After the reduction-in-force notices go out, the agency will move into a \"transition period of several weeks\" to phase in the new organization chart, a senior State Department official told reporters on Thursday.",
      "The official said the changes are aimed at \"streamlining this bloated bureaucracy,\" cutting redundant departments, consolidating functions like human resources and finance, and shifting more focus to foreign embassies and offices assigned to handle specific regions.",
      "For example, the official said, the State Department has multiple offices that oversee sanctions.",
      "\"Now, no one's saying that the people who were working in any of those sanctions offices weren't doing a good job or weren't valuable members of the State Department family, but at the end of the day, we have to do what's right for the mission and what's right for the American people, and that means having one combined sanctions office,\" the official said.",
      "The department's Political Affairs bureau \u2014 which includes the country-specific desks that handle the United States' relations with individual nations and regions \u2014 is \"largely unaffected by the reductions,\" according to the official.",
      "Another senior State Department official told reporters the department \"identified offices where natural efficiencies could be found.\"",
      "\"We took a very deliberate step to reorganize the State Department to be more efficient and more focused,\" Rubio told reporters during a trip to Malaysia on Thursday.",
      "The State Department formally told lawmakers\u00a0in May that it intended to eliminate about 3,400 U.S.-based jobs and close or merge almost half of its domestic offices. At the time, the department said it planned to phase out some offices focused on democracy or human rights that it claimed were \"prone to ideological capture,\" and add new offices focused on \"civil liberties\" and \"free market principles.\"",
      "The plan also integrates the previous functions of the U.S. Agency for International Development into the State Department, after the Trump administration moved to shutter the foreign aid agency. That move has drawn stiff criticism, with Democrats arguing the agency was unlawfully shut down without permission from Congress and humanitarian groups warning the shutdown could endanger public health.",
      "Democrats \u2014 and department staff \u2014 push back",
      "The broader cuts to the State Department have drawn pushback from Democratic lawmakers, who argue the moves could undermine American diplomatic efforts.",
      "\"The notion that it's a plan dignifies it. It's just a willy-nilly effort to just sack a whole lot of people,\" Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, told reporters Friday.",
      "Many department staff have also expressed alarm at the changes. The American Foreign Service Association, which represents foreign service officers in the U.S. and abroad, said Friday the layoffs are \"untethered from merit or mission\" and could signal to other countries that \"the United States is pulling back from the world stage.\"",
      "\"They target diplomats not for how they've served or the skills they have, but for where they happen to be assigned. That is not reform,\" the association said in a statement Friday.",
      "For foreign service officers, who typically rotate between assignments every few years, the reductions-in-force are based on whether they worked in an office impacted by the reorganization on May 29, one of the two senior State Department officials told reporters Thursday.",
      "A current State Department employee told CBS News there are people who were in these positions six weeks ago but have since moved on to new assignments. \"So why would you punish them for previously having held a job that they're no longer in?\" they said. \"It makes absolutely no sense.\"",
      "The second senior State Department official told reporters, \"we've tried to do this in an anonymized, functional way.\"",
      "\"Some of these are positions that are being eliminated, not people,\" Rubio said Thursday.",
      "The first senior department official also said, \"We're going to work to handle this in a manner that preserves, to the maximum extent possible, the dignity of federal employees.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Saturday announced he is levying 30% tariffs against Mexico and the European Union. They are set to begin on Aug. 1.",
      "He announced the tariffs on two of the United States' biggest trade partners in letters posted on this Truth Social account.",
      "In his letter to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the country has helped stem the flow of undocumented migrants and fentanyl into the U.S. But he said the country has not done enough to stop North America from turning into a \"Narco-Trafficking Playground.\"",
      "\"Mexico has been helping me secure the border, BUT, what Mexico has done, is not enough,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "The Mexican economy and foreign ministries, in a joint statement on Saturday, said they had been informed of the new tariffs during a meeting in Washington, D.C. on Friday.",
      "\"We mentioned at the table that it was an unfair deal and that we did not agree,\" the statement said.",
      "Following Mr. Trump's announcement, Sheinbaum asserted that the sovereignty of the Mexican people is non-negotiable, saying the tariff is \"for all the countries in the world, each one of them is being sent a letter.\"",
      "The Mexican president said the two countries are \"seeking to reach an agreement so that these tariffs do not exist.\"",
      "In his letter to the European Union, Mr. Trump said the relationship between the bloc and the U.S. has been \"far from Reciprocal,\" and that the U.S. trade deficit was a national security threat.",
      "\"We have had years to discuss our Trading Relationship with The European Union, and have concluded that we must move away from these long-term, large, and persistent Trade Deficits, engendered by your Tariff, and Non-Tariff, Policies and Trade Barriers,\" he wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump is in an announcement blitz of new tariffs with allies and foes alike, a bedrock of his 2024 campaign that he said would set the foundation for reviving a U.S. economy that he claims has been ripped off by other nations for decades.",
      "With the reciprocal tariffs, Mr. Trump is effectively blowing up the rules governing world trade. For decades, the U.S. and most other countries abided by tariff rates set through a series of complex negotiations known as the Uruguay Round. Countries could set their own tariffs \u2013 but under the \"most favored nation'' approach, they couldn't charge one country more than they charged another.",
      "\"Our smaller trading partners could become much bigger trading partners,\"\u00a0White House National Economic Council director Kevin Hassett said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0\"And that's, I think, one of the reasons why countries are racing to set deals up with us ahead of the deadline.\"",
      "The European Union's chief trade negotiator said earlier this week that a trade deal to avert higher tariffs on European goods imported to the U.S. could be reached \"even in the coming days.\" Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d told EU lawmakers in Strasbourg, France on Wednesday that the EU had been spared the increased tariffs contained in the letters Mr. Trump sent on Monday, and that an extension of talks would provide \"additional space to reach a satisfactory conclusion.\"",
      "The bloc collectively sells more to the U.S. than any other country. U.S. goods imports from the EU topped $553 billion in 2022, according to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, acknowledged Mr. Trump's letter and said in a statement on Saturday that imposing the tariffs on EU exports would \"disrupt essential transatlantic supply chains, to the detriment of businesses, consumers and patients on both sides of the Atlantic.\"",
      "\"Few economies in the world match the European Union's level of openness and adherence to fair trading practices. The EU has consistently prioritized a negotiated solution with the U.S., reflecting our commitment to dialogue, stability, and a constructive transatlantic partnership,\" she added. \"We remain ready to continue working towards an agreement by August 1. At the same time, we will take all necessary steps to safeguard EU interests, including the adoption of proportionate countermeasures if required.\"",
      "Steeper tariffs\u00a0that Mr. Trump announced on April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the\u00a0financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect, but he kept the 10% baseline in place while raising the tariff rate on goods imported from China. Chinese goods are now subject to 30% across-the-board tariffs. The freeze expired on Wednesday.",

      "President Trump is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since he took office in January, multiple diplomatic sources told CBS News.",
      "The sources indicated the new funding could be intended to send a message to Russia, which has pounded Ukraine with drone and missile attacks in recent days. Russia this week launched what Ukraine described as the largest drone attack since its full-scale invasion began in February 2022 \u2014 the latest in a wave of aerial assaults that have pummeled Kyiv and other cities.",
      "Mr. Trump hinted earlier this week that he planned to send Ukraine more defensive weapons. Just days earlier, his administration paused some arms shipments \u2014 a move one White House official cast as one part of a wider global review of weapons transfers.",
      "The source of the possible new funding for Ukraine is unclear. But U.S. officials told CBS News Mr. Trump has $3.85 billion in leftover Biden-era presidential drawdown authority sitting at his fingertips, which could be used to send American military equipment to Ukraine. Former officials also told CBS News the president has the authority to seize around $5 billion in foreign Russian assets and direct the funds to Ukraine, though neither he, nor former President Joe Biden have used that power.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "The U.S. has sent tens of billions of dollars in military aid to Ukraine since early 2022. Mr. Trump has previously been critical of that spending, and has pressed Ukraine and Russia to work toward a peace agreement \u2014 periodically lashing out at both countries.",
      "In recent days, Russia has drawn the president's ire. He told reporters last week he was \"very disappointed\" with a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and he later suggested that Russia's strikes on Ukraine could prompt him to send more arms to Ukraine.",
      "\"Putin is not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people,\" Mr. Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting Tuesday. \"So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I've approved that.\"",
      "At other points, Mr. Trump has attacked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. A February Oval Office meeting with the Ukrainian leader descended into a verbal argument, leading to a brief pause on U.S. aid, and Mr. Trump has accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the war.",
      "Trump says \"NATO is paying\" for Ukraine aid",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has pushed European countries to take on a larger share of the burden of supporting Ukraine.",
      "NATO told CBS News on Friday it was working with member states to \"urgently\" move U.S.-made ammunition and air defenses to Ukraine, but declined to explain if any new mechanism had been established to do so. A day earlier, Mr. Trump spoke with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte to discuss European partners purchasing U.S.-made equipment, according to diplomatic sources.",
      "U.S. law requires countries to seek approval before transferring any American-made equipment to a third party such as Ukraine. Under both Mr. Trump and Biden, the federal government has approved transfers by other countries to Ukraine.",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested NATO would buy weapons from the U.S. to transfer to Ukraine. That would mark a dramatic shift in policy since, in the past, NATO as an institution has not directly armed non-member state Ukraine. Instead, individual members of the alliance have chosen to assist Ukraine on their own.",
      "\"We're sending weapons to NATO, and NATO is paying for those weapons, 100%,\" Mr. Trump told NBC News' Kristen Welker.",
      "When asked about the NATO plan during a press availability in Malaysia on Friday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio declined to detail any new mechanism and referred to plans for European countries to buy weapons.",

      "\"Copper is necessary for Semiconductors, Aircraft, Ships, Ammunition, Data Centers, Lithium-ion Batteries, Radar Systems, Missile Defense Systems, and even, Hypersonic Weapons, of which we are building many,\" he wrote. \"Copper is the second most used material by the Department of Defense! Why did our foolish (and SLEEPY!) 'Leaders' decimate this important Industry? This 50% TARIFF will reverse the Biden Administration's thoughtless behavior, and stupidity. America will, once again, build a DOMINANT Copper Industry.\"",
      "Price jump",
      "Ryan Young, a senior economist at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said copper is an integral component in electrical wiring and plumbing, as well being used as a heat conductor in radiators and household appliances. He worries that a hefty copper tariff will trigger inflation.",
      "Copper prices had already surged 13% on Tuesday, reaching a record high, after Mr. Trump floated the possible tariff.",
      "\"It's bad news all around,\" Young said of Mr. Trump's proposed copper tariff. \"If companies' costs go up they pass them along to consumers, so we'd see higher prices for home repairs and anything that uses copper.\"",
      "Copper tariffs could also make maintaining the nation's electric grid more expensive and drive up household energy costs, Young said. \"It would negatively affect the electricity industry and anybody who uses electricity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has said that tariffs provide financial incentives to ramp up domestic production, including of critical materials like copper, and help create manufacturing jobs.",
      "\"America cannot be reliant on foreign imports of the copper that's necessary for key military hardware, infrastructure and everyday electronics,\" White House Spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump administration is committed to reshoring manufacturing that's critical [to] our national and economic security with a two-pronged approach of tariffs and a full suite of supply-side reforms like deregulation and the pro-growth tax cuts of The One, Big, Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "Ripple effects",
      "The biggest users of copper \u2014 and therefore most exposed to the tariff increase \u2014 include a vast range of industries, covering everything from construction to semiconductors, electric vehicles and renewable energy components such as solar panels, according to industry data.",
      "Daan de Jonge, copper demand and prices lead analyst at Benchmark Mineral Intelligence, said in a research note that \"a 50% price hike will have inevitable ripple effects on the cost of new infrastructure, the cost of housing the cost of fridges, cars, air conditioning.\"",
      "For consumers, that means the cost of appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners, as well as EVs, would likely rise if this 50% tariff goes into effect, according to analysts.",
      "\"Copper is an important element in development of semiconductors and electric vehicles. And the tariff announcement caused prices to go up quite dramatically, so you can tell it's a pretty big deal,\" Veronique de Rugy, a professor of political economy and senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The reason President Trump picked copper is because it's such a big deal for a lot of important things.\"",
      "Carveouts for key partners?",
      "The U.S. gets roughly two-thirds of its copper imports from Chile and Canada, with additional supply coming from Peru and Mexico.\u00a0 The U.S.'s net copper imports met 53% of U.S. demand for copper last year, according to Morgan Stanley research.",
      "Experts note that Mr. Trump isn't certain to hike duties on copper, saying his proposal could be aimed more at securing concession from exporters.",
      "\"These are two examples of countries that the U.S. could offer some sort of quota or export restraint relief to as part of a broader deal,\" UBS chief investment strategist Kurt Reiman told CBS MoneyWatch, referring to Canada and Chile. A revamped U.S. trade policy could also include carveouts for foreign copper suppliers, he added",
      "Although the U.S. could ramp up domestic copper production, it would take years to significantly increase output, Reiman said. \"We aren't ready. The mines would have to be built out, and that's typically a multi-year process.\"",
      "The sectoral tariff threats come after Mr. Trump this week announced stiff new tariff rates on 20 nations\u00a0that have not yet reached trade agreements with the U.S and that he said would take effect on Aug. 1. He outlined the new rates, posted in nearly identical letters on Truth Social, as a 90-day pause on so-called \"reciprocal\" levies was\u00a0set to expire\u00a0on Wednesday.",

    "story": [
      "FIFA has opened an office in Trump Tower in New York City, the organization's president Gianna Infantino announced this week, in the latest sign of deepening ties between soccer's governing body and President Trump before the U.S. hosts next year's World Cup.",
      "Infantino announced the decision in a presentation at the Trump Organization's Manhattan headquarters Monday, where he was joined by the president's son Eric Trump and former Brazilian soccer star Ronaldo, a two-time World Cup winner.",
      "\"So today, we are opening an office of FIFA here in Trump Tower,\" Infantino said.",
      "The FIFA president added that soccer's governing body has \"received such a big support\" from the Trump White House and its World Cup task force. That government task force is chaired by Mr. Trump, whom Infantino called \"a big fan of soccer.\"",
      "He also thanked Eric Trump and the Trump Organization for their support. \"Our success is your success,\" the FIFA president said. Eric Trump, executive vice president at the Trump Organization, praised the FIFA president for \"bringing the tournament\" to the U.S.",
      "CBS News has reached out to FIFA and the Trump Organization for comment.",
      "The FIFA president has built close ties with Mr. Trump since he returned to office in January.",
      "Infantino has made several appearances alongside the U.S. leader: He attended the president's inauguration, has visited the Oval Office at least twice and met Mr. Trump during his overseas trip to the Middle East in May, during which the FIFA leader received a standing ovation.",
      "\"Great job, Gianni,\" Mr. Trump said at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum.",
      "Infantino was late to FIFA's annual congress held in Paraguay after joining Mr. Trump in Saudi Arabia and Qatar in May. In protest, delegates from FIFA's European confederation, UEFA, walked out of that session.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, UEFA called Infantino's delay \"deeply regrettable\" and backed its representatives, saying that the \"last minute\" request by FIFA to \"accommodate private political interests does the game no service.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, meanwhile, told reporters this week he plans to attend the final of the Club World Cup at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on Sunday.",
      "The Club World Cup trophy was also revealed to the public at Trump Tower earlier this week. It was first displayed in the Oval Office in March and will now stay in Mr. Trump's New York property until Sunday's finals, in which French champions and UEFA Champions League winners Paris Saint Germain will face English Premier League team Chelsea.",
      "The Club World Cup brings individual clubs from all six continental confederations of FIFA. Under the new format, 32 teams were selected for this year's tournament based on their domestic and international achievements. Although similar in name, the better-known World Cup features national teams only.",
      "The opening of an office in Trump Tower is another move to expand FIFA's presence in the United States ahead of the World Cup. Last summer, it opened a legal and compliance division office in Miami.",
      "The United States, Canada, and Mexico are set to co-host the World Cup next year. Two Canadian, three Mexican, and 11 American cities will welcome 48 nations to the iconic competition, up from 32, its first increase since 1998.",
      "Mr. Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a massive spending law that passed both chambers of Congress last week, allocates $625 million for World Cup security funding. It also offers $1 billion for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in the World Cup dates back to his first term, when FIFA awarded the event to the U.S. and its neighbors. The president urged other FIFA members to support the U.S. bid ahead of FIFA's 2018 decision.",
      "Hosting the World Cup has become as sought-after as the Olympics for nations around the world. The event attracts a massive television audience, with some 570 million viewers tuning into the 2022 Finals match, according to figures from FIFA.",
      "But the selection process has increasingly attracted controversy, with FIFA facing allegations of corruption and bribery in the way it has managed past contests to secure hosting and media rights. Federal officials in the U.S. have prosecuted the heads of various regional soccer bodies for taking bribes and kickbacks. The organization denies the accusations of widespread bribery and says the game is for everyone.",
      "\"We want to make football truly global and in order for football to become truly global, we need to embrace the entire globe,\" Infantino said in the draw ceremony of the 2023 Club World Cup in Saudi Arabia.",

    "published": "Sun, 13 Jul 2025 10:45:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Barbara Rae-Venter never anticipated that her genealogy hobby would lead to the capture of one of California's most notorious criminals, the Golden State Killer. Her pioneering use of genetic genealogy has since helped solve numerous cold cases.",
    "story": [
      "Barbara Rae-Venter, a 76-year-old patent attorney living in Marina, California, thought she'd spend her retirement leisurely playing tennis, traveling, and indulging in her favorite pastime: researching her ancestry and building a family tree. It didn't quite work out that way. For Rae-Venter, something she started as a hobby led to capturing one of the most notorious criminals in California.",
      "Seven years ago, Rae-Venter, using her genetic research skills, tracked down a fugitive in California who had eluded capture for more than three decades, and remarkably, she did it without ever leaving her home.",
      "The fugitive was the Golden State Killer. In April 2018, the FBI and California law enforcement made headlines with a stunning announcement: \"We found the needle in the haystack, and it was right here in Sacramento.\"",
      "Since 1974, investigators had sought the man responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 rapes in the state of California. But it wasn't until Rae-Venter joined the investigation that they learned his name: Joseph James DeAngelo. \"It's not that I'm so very special,\" said Rae-Venter. \"It's just I happened to be in the right place at the right time.\"",
      "Using DNA left by DeAngelo at a crime scene, Rae-Venter identified him by using a technique now known as investigative genetic genealogy. \"It's just basically doing the same as you would do if you're doing family history research, and augmenting that with DNA to make sure that the relatives that you find are really related to you,\" she said.",
      "Her crime-solving career began quite by accident. Rae-Venter, who also has a Ph.D. in biology, was volunteering as a search angel \u2013 a person who helps adoptees find their biological parents. \"It's such a fundamental desire,\" she said. \"They're just so focused. They just so want to know where they came from.\"",
      "A Living Jane Doe",
      "In 2015, Rae-Venter responded to an email sent by Peter Headley, then a veteran investigator with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, and fell into her first mystery. Headley was trying to uncover the true identity of a woman in her 30s who had been kidnapped as a child. \"She really wanted to know who she was,\" said Headley, referring to her as a living Jane Doe. \"She's alive, but we have no idea who she is,\" he said.",
      "That living \"Jane Doe\" went by the name of Lisa Jenson. At five years old, she had been abandoned at an RV park by a man called Gordon Jenson. \"It turned out she had been kidnapped by the suspect, and he just told everyone that he was her father,\" Headley said.",
      "Later, detectives learned that Gordon Jenson was just one of many aliases used by Terry Rasmussen, a notorious serial killer, who died in prison in 2010 without ever revealing who Lisa really was.",
      "Lisa Jenson did not know who her mother was, or if she had any sisters or brothers. Headley said that Lisa had heard about genetic genealogy and wondered if that could lead her to her real family: \"I said, 'Okay, let's try it.' So, opened an account for her, got her in Ancestry, and we had some distant matches, and I'm like, this might just work.\"",
      "But this was new territory for Headley, so he emailed DNA Adoption for help and found Barbara Rae-Venter. Asked why she agreed to collaborate, Rae-Venter replied, \"It was a puzzle!\"",
      "She began the laborious process of building family trees to find Lisa's real family, which involved more than just looking at DNA: \"The DNA is just the jump-off point. You're doing census records, you're doing birth, death and marriage records. My favorite is probably Facebook. I've actually built trees from the amount of stuff people have put in their Facebook pages.\"",
      "Headley helped by coaxing distant relatives to take DNA tests. \"People were skeptical, thought it was a scam,\" he said. \"One lady thought I was going to clone her.\"",
      "And DNA tests are expensive. Headley and Rae-Venter reached into their own pockets to help subsidize the costs.",
      "I asked, \"So, you're not only not getting paid to do this work, you're actually paying for these tests?\"",
      "\"We probably each spent a couple of thousand dollars on kits,\" Rae-Venter said.",
      "It took nearly a year, but in 2016, the DNA trail led to New Hampshire, and the case of a missing young mother, Denise Beaudin. She and her infant daughter had vanished from her home, along with a man named Bob Evans, which turned out to be yet another alias of that serial killer, Terry Rasmussen",
      "Investigators believe Rasmussen killed Denise and kidnapped her little girl. For the first time, Lisa Jenson was about to learn her real name: Dawn Beaudin.",
      "Headley said, \"I called Lisa up and I asked her if she wanted to know her real name, we had figured it out. And she just got real quiet, and very quietly said yes.\"",
      "Lisa has asked for privacy, but, in a phone call told Rae-Venter that she could finally move on in her life, including getting married.",
      "\"She just said it didn't feel right when she didn't really know who she was or where she'd come from,\" said Rae-Venter. \"And now that she knew that, she felt comfortable now going forward and getting married. I just thought that was so special.\"",
      "Building the Family Tree of a Killer",
      "It was one of the first times that genetic genealogy was used to solve a criminal case \u2013 and word spread fast. In 2017, Rae-Venter got a call: Could she use the same technique to find the Golden State Killer? At the time, there were six full-time investigators and three FBI agents on the case, and they couldn't find him. Rae-Venter thought the DNA would tell her who he was. \"I was absolutely certain of that,\" she said.",
      "Investigators provided a DNA profile left at a California crime scene, and Rae-Venter uploaded it to GED Match and Family Tree DNA. This time, she was building the family tree of a killer.",
      "Sixty-three days later, she said, \"I'm sitting there at three in the morning all by my little lonesome staring at my computer. I know who you are: You're Joseph DeAngelo.\"",
      "I asked, \"At that moment, were you the only person in the world who knew who the Golden State Killer was?\"",
      "\"Besides him? Probably,\" Rae-Venter replied.",
      "It was an astonishing breakthrough. But Rae-Venter's word was not enough to make an arrest. \"I'm providing an investigative lead. You still need some old-fashioned detective work,\" she said.",
      "So investigators got to work getting a DNA sample from DeAngelo himself to confirm he was the right guy. Within days, the brutal killer who had evaded law enforcement for decades was finally behind bars.",
      "In 2020, DeAngelo was sentenced to 13 consecutive life sentences. After DeAngelo was locked away, Rae-Venter decided that it was time to share her incredible story in a book, \"I Know Who You Are.\" She has been profiled in The New York Times, and appeared on Time Magazine's list of the most influential people.",
      "And she's come out of retirement. Her group, Firebird Forensics, works with law enforcement agencies nationwide to solve cases using genetic genealogy, and has solved approximately 60 cases. She even travels around the country teaching others her technique.",
      "In 2023 she described the process of using genetic genealogy as \"very addictive, because you know you're hot on the trail and you just know if you just keep going a little bit longer, you're going to find the connections you're looking for.\"",
      "But her line of work has also raised concerns about privacy. More than 53 million people have already uploaded their DNA profiles to public databases. Should police be able to use that information to track down the users' criminal relatives? \"Well, unfortunately, I think that horse left the barn a long time ago,\" Rae-Venter  said.",
      "And the trade-off may be worth it, says Rae-Venter and others, if it means getting killers and rapists off the streets. Michael O'Malley, the prosecuting attorney in Cuyahoga County, Ohio, said, \"There was a lot of light bulbs going off across the country saying, 'What great technology! How do we bring it to our community to solve violent crimes?'\"",
      "Watch Part Two of Erin Moriarty's report:",
      "Who is John Doe #147?",
      "O'Malley is a witness to a sad statistic in this country: more and more serious crimes are going unsolved. \"I get violent crime reports that come across my desk every day, and only a fraction of those are solved,\" he said.",
      "In 2020, O'Malley's office set up the G.O.L.D. Unit, a team of prosecutors who use the latest forensic tools to find criminals and get them off the streets. It's run by supervising assistant prosecuting attorney Mary Weston. \"We review cases, mostly sexual assaults and homicides at this time, that can be re-investigated using perhaps updated technologies,\" she said.",
      "Among them, cases involving sexual predators, like John Doe #147. \"That's all we knew him as,\" said Weston.",
      "On a hot afternoon in August 1997, a man grabbed a nine-year-old boy in the woods behind a school in the Cleveland suburbs, and sexually assaulted him.",
      "The nine-year-old victim is now a thirty-seven-year old man, who asked us to call him \"Michael,\" and not show his face. Describing the years since the assault, he said, \"It's just been a lot of ups-and-downs, you know? I had doubts, thinking, 'Would I ever, would we ever find the guy?'",
      "\"I remember running to my dad, him taking me to the hospital,\" Michael said. \"But the most I could remember is my mom. She was just crying hysterically on the front porch, just blaming herself, and the neighbors are trying to calm her down.\"",
      "Investigators knew little about the predator back in 1997, according to O'Malley: \"The young boy gave a description, roughly, of his age, and his body build. But really that was it,\" he said.",
      "There was DNA left on the child's clothing. In 2003, a profile was submitted to the federal database (known as CODIS), which contains DNA profiles of convicted offenders. There was no match. So, investigators had a DNA profile, but not a name to go with it.",
      "\"I was crushed,\" said Michael. \"I think, my only hope is just gone. He's gonna actually get away with it.\"",
      "To stop the statute of limitations for rape from running out, \"John Doe #147\" was indicted, but with no leads, the case went cold. Weston said, \"At the time, you know, we were at a loss. What are we gonna do for this boy? He's not a boy anymore, but what can we do to try to help solve his case?\"",
      "Michael said he was scared that the predator might find him again: \"Oh, yeah, I always thought, 'Could this guy be watching?' And he threatened to kill me if I had told anybody about the horrible incident.\"",
      "But in 2018, Michael \u2013 and the rest of the world \u2013 watched the Golden State Killer case play out on TV. \"And it was like a lightbulb lit above my head,\" he said. \"I'm like, 'Oh, there's another way.'\"",
      "The capture of notorious serial killer James James   DeAngelo introduced the world to investigative genetic genealogy. Could that same technique help solve Michael's case? Investigators would need a more complete profile of the rapist's DNA. But again, there was a hitch: when investigators went looking for the rape kit from Michael's case, they discovered that it had been destroyed.",
      "\"I'm not your victim anymore\"",
      "But investigators didn't give up, and got a stroke of luck when a key piece of evidence was discovered at the county's crime laboratory: an original tube used for testing that could have some leftover DNA. \"I was very, very excited,\" said Weston. \"But then there's the waiting. Is it gonna be enough? And then, 'Are you gonna be able to work with this very tiny amount of DNA?' It's nine nanograms.\"",
      "Astoundingly, it was enough, and in March 2022, they turned to someone familiar: Barbara Rae-Venter, the genealogist who tracked down the Golden State Killer. \"If I had faith in anybody to do it, it was her,\" said Weston. \"She had solved a few cases for us already, and I knew this case was in good hands.\"",
      "It took two months. Rae-Venter came up with a list of suspects, all brothers. Ohio investigators then were able to narrow that list down to just one, and asked Michael to view a photo lineup. \"Immediately, you know, my heart started pounding,\" he said. \"I started getting clammy and sweaty, sorta like a flashback, you know, to when I seen him standing there in the woods.\"",
      "The man he recognized was Dennis Gribble, an Ohio resident with a long history of sex crimes. It was all investigators needed to get a search warrant. Days later, they appeared on Gribble's doorstep to get a DNA sample, telling him, \"Please open your mouth.\"",
      "What was his reaction? \"He was stunned, but he complied,\" O'Malley said. \"And we took it back to our lab and confirmed that he was the individual who sexually assaulted Michael back in 1997.\"",
      "And that's how, in May 2023, John Doe #147, now identified as Dennis Gribble, appeared in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs in a Cleveland courtroom. Michael was there. He looked at Gribble (\"I was just disgusted\"), and read an impact statement to the court: \"I have learned to be a better person and a father than the monster you are and will always be.\"",
      "Michael said, \"I wanted to show him he didn't get the best of me. I'm not your victim anymore. I'm not somebody you prey on anymore.\"",
      "Gribble, now 75, pleaded guilty to one count of rape, and is currently serving 10 years in prison.",
      "With a federal grant to help cover the costs of testing, the G.O.L.D. Unit has now helped solve 13 rape cases in the Cleveland area, with Barbara Rae-Venter's help. Yet, neither O'Malley nor Weston has ever met Rae-Venter. \"We Zoom!\" Weston laughed.",
      "I asked, \"Is that a little odd, that you're working with this investigator who really never leaves her dining room table? That's where she does all her investigations.\"",
      "\"I hope she never leaves it again!\" O'Malley laughed.",
      "The technique that Rae-Venter used to track down Dennis Gribble has been used to identify other elusive criminals, including Bryan Kohberger, who earlier this month pleaded guilty to killing four University of Idaho students in 2022.",
      "O'Malley says he believes genetic genealogy will someday solve less serious offenses as well. \"Right now, it's still a very expensive tool, and it takes a lot of time,\" he said. \"But I do see it expanding in the future.\"",
      "Still, as the field expands, so have privacy concerns. Some states have set limits, although there are no national laws restricting the use of genetic genealogy by law enforcement.",
      "And for victims like Michael, the benefits outweigh the risks. Genetic genealogy was his only chance for justice. \"It was a needle in a haystack,\" he said. \"The guy would have got away scot-free. Had it not been for DNA and genealogy, I would have never been here today. We wouldn't even be talking about it.\"",

Pieces of Mars found on Earth are rare. According to the auction house, just 400 of the more than 77,000 officially recognized meteorites found on Earth \u2014 or about 0.6% \u2014 are from Mars. The meteorite represents approximately 6.5% of all Martian material currently known on Earth.",

      "The Cat's Paw Nebula is named after its resemblance to a feline footprint: The nebula appears to have three toes, colloquially called \"toe beans,\" and a wider heel. The nebula is near the Scorpius constellation and is about 4,000 light-years from Earth, NASA said in a news release. The James Webb Telescope focused its Near-Infrared Camera on one of the \"toe beans\" to look through the gas and dust that make up the nebula.",
      "The telescope found an \"active star-forming region.\" The young stars, shown in yellow, appear to be \"carving away at nearby gas and dust,\" NASA said.",
      "The stars are also emitting bright light, represented in blue in the Webb images. Glowing red spots in the Webb images show areas where star formation is underway, NASA said. Other stars look blue-white. These ones have no radiation between themselves and Webb's camera, NASA said. At the bottom of the \"toe bean\" are small, dense filaments of dust that may be dense enough to collapse in on themselves and begin the process of becoming stars. The dust itself is imaged in brown.",
      "The colorful scene is temporary, NASA said, but will shape the area's future.",
      "\"As a consequence of these massive stars' lively behavior, the local star formation process will eventually come to a stop,\" NASA said.",
      "The images were released to celebrate the third anniversary of the telescope, which\u00a0launched in July 2022. Since then, it has made a number of discoveries, including showing that the universe evolved faster than astronomers believed, NASA said. The telescope has also imaged a number of stars and planets, and identified asteroids that might come near Earth.",

    "published": "Sun, 13 Jul 2025 14:24:22 -0400",
    "summary": "People are turning to AI dating assistants for help in crafting wittier, more conversational messages to attract romantic partners on apps.",
    "story": [
      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is as difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service, called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",
      "\"The risk is when we use AI as a substitute for human connection, rather than a supplement to it,\" she said.",

As part of that effort, the company will fold Glassdoor operations into Indeed, the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong is stepping down.",
      "\"[W]hen we think about HR industry, which is $300 billion-plus industry, but it includes like 60% or 65% of human labor manual cost. It's very difficult to find that big industry with such a high percentage of human labor manual cost,\" Idekoba said in May at a JPMorgan Chase technology conference. \"And so what we believe is, basically, how can we simplify hiring with using AI and technology and data to reduce manual work. That's what we are focusing on.\"",
      "He added that about one-third of the company's new programming code is written by AI, and that he expects that figure to jump to one-half. \"It's going to be 50% pretty soon,\" he said.",

      "After the post was deleted, the chatbot walked back the statement and said it was \"an unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration.\"",

    "story": [
      "Meta\u00a0has removed paid advertisements for channels on the\u00a0Telegram\u00a0messaging app that promoted escort and sex work services in the U.S. and other countries from its Instagram platform.",
      "CBS News found multiple paid advertisements on Meta's Instagram stories feature that promoted opportunities to meet women alongside URL links that led to the Telegram platform. Several such ads were promoted by an Instagram account with over 100,000 followers called Royal Garden Club that marketed itself as a \"premium dating agency for wealthy men\" alongside a link to both a website and a Telegram channel.",
      "Meta spokesperson Erin Logan told CBS News the company had removed the accounts associated with the advertisements and disabled the ad accounts for violating Meta's content moderation policies.",
      "Meta also confirmed to CBS News that it had banned the administrators of the ad accounts from advertising on the company's social media platforms.",
      "Logan pointed to the company's human exploitation policy, which includes removing \"content where a third-party actor recruits for, facilitates or benefits from commercial sexual activity,\" as well as the company's adult sexual solicitation policy which, amongst other things, removes \"content that offers, asks or provides methods of contact for prostitution.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club's Telegram channel explicitly offered potential clients access to \"over 7,000 girls worldwide for fun dates, relationships and hot sex.\" That included advertising a \"VIP lifetime\" offer of $8,000 of \"top models, bloggers, actresses, athletes, magazine cover girls, adult stars.\"",
      "Royal Garden Club claimed on its Telegram that it is a \"full-service escort agency operating legally,\" pointing to the fact that the business, R GARDEN LLP, is registered in the United Kingdom. A CBS News review of public business records in the U.K. found the company R GARDEN LLP registered to a London address.",
      "Reached on Telegram, an anonymous moderator for the Royal Garden Club channel declined to comment when asked how it was able to promote ads on Instagram, and what type of service the company offers.",
      "Another paid Instagram ad was promoted by an account called men.s_dreams, which appeared to be a shell account with very little content and very few followers. That advertisement promoted \"meeting beautiful girls\" and included a link to a Telegram channel. The Telegram channel in question, called \"Meeting with Girls,\" had messages written in both Russian and English promoting \"girls ready to fly with you anywhere in the world.\"",
      "That channel posted profile pictures of hundreds of women and noted their nationalities. CBS News could not independently verify the identity of the women, nor verify if they had consented to their images being shared by the channel. The anonymous moderator of the account repeatedly posted messages on the public channel asking prospective clients to send private messages if they wanted to \"know something about girls, sex or anything.\"",
      "CBS News has also sought comment from this account about how it was able to pay for ads on Instagram.",
      "While Meta has strict content moderation policies, Telegram is known for its hands-off approach. The platform's content moderation policies outlined on its website do not include anything beyond banning \"illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels,\" or engaging in \"activities that are recognized as illegal in the majority of countries.\" CBS News has sought comment from Telegram as to whether the channels in question violate the platform's policies or will cause Telegram to review its policies.",
      "In recent months, Meta has struggled to combat a rise in sexualized paid advertisements appearing for some users, despite such ads violating its terms of use. A CBS News investigation last month\u00a0uncovered hundreds of ads\u00a0on its platforms promoting \"nudify\" apps \u2014 AI tools used to create sexually explicit deepfake images of real people.",
      "Many of these ads targeted male users between the ages of 18 and 65, in the United States and the European Union.",
      "Later in June, Meta sued one of the most prominent nudify app makers, filing a lawsuit in Hong Kong against Joy Timeline HK Limited, the entity behind the app \"CrushAI,\" to prevent it from advertising the app on Meta platforms.",

    "summary": "Ground search operations were suspended Sunday in Kerr County, Texas, where crews have continued to look for those still lost after catastrophic July 4 flooding.",
    "story": [
      "Emergency crews were able to resume some recovery efforts after being forced to suspend search operations in Kerr County, Texas, on Sunday, as the area hit hardest by catastrophic flash flooding earlier this month faced a renewed flood threat.",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said Sunday afternoon that rescue operations were underway in San Saba, Lampasas and Schleicher Counties. Evacuations are also ongoing in several Central Texas counties as authorities monitor rising water in Kerrville, the city hardest-hit city by the\u00a0destructive July 4 storms\u00a0that caused the Guadalupe River to overflow.",
      "Officials in Texas' rural, flood-prone Hill Country have said at least 161 people from the area remain missing and efforts to find them are ongoing.",
      "Abbott said on social media later Sunday that \"dozens\" of people had been rescued from the latest flooding in the Lampasas area.",
      "The serious threat unfolding in San Saba County is along the San Saba River, another area known to flood. Rains from this weekend\u00a0 \u2014 on top of the already soaked ground \u2014 were forecast to raise the river above 30 inches. The river was forecast to rise faster and higher than it did on July 4.",
      "Police in Kerrville announced that ground search operations had been paused before 8 a.m. local time Sunday due to \"flood danger.\"",
      "\"We will provide more information soon but for now, all search crews need to evacuate the river corridor until further notice. Any volunteer search parties in the Guadalupe River corridor need to heed this warning,\" the police department wrote in a social media post. \"The potential for a flash flood is high.\"",
      "The department also shared an emergency weather alert that warned of \"a high probability of the Guadalupe River at Hunt reaching flood stage today.\" It urged people, equipment and vehicles to move away from the water immediately. Hunt was the site of particularly disastrous flooding early in the morning on July 4, with officials saying the river swelled more than 20 feet in less than an hour and ultimately killed at least 106 people countywide, including dozens of children at a riverside summer camp called Camp Mystic.",
      "A\u00a0flash flood warning was issued for parts of Kerr County on Sunday morning, along with other pockets of Central Texas. The Austin-San Antonio branch of the National Weather Service issued the warning as thunderstorms began to dump heavy rain over the area, and rainfall was expected to continue at a rate of 1 to 2.5 inches per hour, according to the forecast bulletin. The Weather Service noted that flash flooding was \"ongoing or expected to begin shortly.\"",
      "A flood watch remained in effect until 9 a.m. Monday, and a flood warning remained in effect for the Guadalupe at Hunt. The Weather Service issues a watch when flooding is possible, and a warning when flooding is imminent. Kerrville Police said water levels at Hunt had reached nearly 8.5 feet by 6:30 a.m. and were expected to rise six more feet over the next four-and-a-half hours, which would be considered a \"moderate flood stage.\"",
      "\"This is a dangerous and life-threatening situation. Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order,\" the city of Kerrville wrote in another social media post, while the Weather Service emphasized that people should exercise serious caution around \"low water crossings,\" which are small bridges built close to the surface of the Guadalupe River.",
      "Kerr County officials said last week that the crossings easily flood, as they did on the morning of July 4, trapping people on small \"islands\" of dry land and making it very difficult for emergency responders to reach them.",
      "Although Kerr County suffered the most tragedy as a result of the inundation more than a week ago, several other counties across Central Texas felt its impacts, too. The death toll statewide has grown to at least 132, and 166 more are unaccounted for, according to the latest information from local officials.",
      "The subsequent search\u00a0for those missing among the debris has been massive. Volunteers, drones and search dogs joined the operation as crews from local, state and federal agencies probed on the ground, through the water and overhead in the air in hopes of uncovering anyone still lost. Difficult weather and harsh terrain have intermittently complicated their efforts, officials said.",

      "A fire near the Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona has destroyed dozens of structures, including the historic Grand Canyon Lodge and a water treatment facility, which caused a chlorine gas leak that forced firefighters to evacuate.",
      "The Dragon Bravo Fire\u00a0in the North Rim of the Grand Canyon \"exhibited extreme and volatile fire behavior\" overnight and expanded to about 5,000 acres, fire managers said Sunday. It was fueled by up to 40 mph wind gusts but firefighters were able to slow the fire's progression using aerial drops of flame retardant.",
      "Approximately 50 to 80 structures have been lost, including the National Park Service administrative buildings and visitor facilities. Photos posted to social media by national park officials on Sunday showed structures near the Grand Canyon Lodge \u2014 the only lodging inside the park at the North Rim \u2014 burned to the ground.",

      "Park Superintendent Ed Keable told park residents, staff and others in a meeting Sunday morning that the visitor center, the gas station, a waste water treatment plant, an administrative building and some employee housing were among the 50 to 80 structures lost. \"Numerous\" historic cabins in the area also were destroyed, the park said.",
      "Fire personnel had to evacuate from critical zones, officials said, as \"the use of aerial retardant was not feasible\" due to the chlorine gas leak, the National Park Service said.",
      "Chlorine gas is heavier than air, meaning it can settle into lower elevations such as the inner canyon and pose a health risk to fire personnel and hikers, according to NPS.",

      "The catastrophic\u00a0July 4 storm caused the Guadalupe River to swell to near-unprecedented levels. More than 100 of those killed, and most of those\u00a0missing, were in Kerr County, which bore the brunt of the disaster in the flood-prone Texas Hill Country west of Austin, the state capital.",
      "President Trump signed a federal disaster declaration at Abbott's request, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to deploy its own teams to support local rescue and recovery efforts as those operations press on. More storms after the initial flooding made efforts especially challenging, officials said.",
      "On Friday, July 11, one week after the disaster struck, Mr. Trump arrived in the region to meet with officials, rescue workers and the families of victims.",
      "\"I've never seen anything like it, a little narrow river that becomes a monster, and that's what happened,\" Mr. Trump said. \"But the first lady and I are here in Texas to express the love and support and the anguish of our entire nation in the aftermath of this really horrific and deadly flood.\"",
      "Camp Mystic tragedy",
      "A large majority of the flooding deaths\u00a0occurred in Kerr County, where officials have confirmed at least 106 people died.",
      "At Camp Mystic, a girls' summer camp with cabins along the river in a rural part of Kerr County near Hunt, at least 27 campers and counselors died in what the camp described as \"catastrophic flooding.\" Some survivors said they woke up to water rushing through the windows.",
      "Kerr County Sheriff Larry Leitha said Wednesday that crews continued to search for five missing campers and one counselor from Camp Mystic.",
      "One child not associated with the camp is also missing, Abbott said Tuesday.",
      "Hundreds of rescuers, including teams from local, state and federal agencies, as well as volunteers, are involved in the search, Texas Game Warden Ben Baker said Tuesday during a news conference.",
      "\"It's very tragic whenever you see human life. But to see a child in that loss of life, is extremely tragic,\" Baker told a reporter who had asked about the impacts on rescuers' mental health.",
      "Abbott said Tuesday he received a text message from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. that said the Department of Health and Human Services is set to declare a public health emergency for the Texas Hill Country flash floods.",
      "\"This will make it easier for health care and mental health providers from out of state to help both by traveling to the area and by telemedicine,\" Abbott said the message read.",
      "26 feet of water rose from Guadalupe River",
      "Friday, July 4, was the last time a missing person was found alive in Kerr County, according to authorities. But search crews continued to survey miles of the Guadalupe River\u00a0in the hope of locating others who may have been lost in the floods that inundated Kerr County, Baker told reporters.",
      "The river runs for approximately 230 miles through a region that sits between Austin and San Antonio, starting in Kerr County and ending along the Gulf Coast. It's nicknamed \"Flash Flood Alley\" because the terrain makes it vulnerable to inundation.",
      "Officials in five other Texas counties have also confirmed deaths in the flooding: Travis County, which includes Austin, as well as Burnet, Kendall, Williamson and Tom Green County.",
      "During the early hours of July 4, the Guadalupe River in Hunt, in Kerr County,\u00a0rose to about 26 feet \u2014 roughly the height of a two-story building \u2014 over the course of just 45 minutes, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said during a news conference.",
      "Camp Mystic was \"horrendously ravaged,\" Abbott later wrote in a social media post after visiting the site. About 650 people were staying there, including around 550 children, according to inspection records released by the Texas Department of State Health Services, which were dated July 2 \u2014 just two days before the flood.",
      "According to the records, Camp Mystic had \"a written plan of procedures to be implemented in case of a disaster,\" which was \"posted in the camp's administrative on-site office.\" But exactly what the plan contained isn't clear. Unlike at least one other camp along the Guadalupe River whose employees spoke to The Associated Press, Camp Mystic did not evacuate to higher ground ahead of the floods.",
      "Kerr County officials said Wednesday that evacuating from Hill Country is not always the best course of action during a storm, echoing an earlier statement released by a joint information center established in the wake of the floods, which said that disaster responses in the Hill Country terrain are complex.",
      "Rural areas, like Hunt, are full of single-lane bridges known as \"low water crossings\" that easily flood and create scattered \"islands\" of land that are impassable, said Johnathan Lam of the police department in Kerrville, a city in Kerr County. Those same locations have inconsistent cell service and are hard to reach for first responders.",
      "\"In Hunt, Highway 39 crisscrosses the Guadalupe again and again and again,\" Lam said. \"And all of those low water crossings, when they flood, they create islands where you can't get in and you can't get out, trapping people in their homes, trapping people in their vehicles. And that's what happened on the morning of July 4.\"",
      "A makeshift crew consisting of two Kerville officers, an emergency room doctor and some volunteer firefighters did what they could to fulfill the duties of a robust response team for 13 hours that first day, until emergency workers in high-profile vehicles were able to reach them at around 5 p.m., Lam said.",
      "Scrutiny over weather forecasts",
      "Whether communities in the path of the flooding received adequate warnings has been heavily scrutinized and is the subject of ongoing debate. Kerr County officials have largely declined to respond to reporters' inquiries on the matter during their daily news conferences.",
      "Some have questioned if the Trump administration's cuts earlier this year to the National Weather Service\u00a0and its parent agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, potentially prevented local forecast offices from sufficiently preparing the public for the extent of the flooding.",
      "Mr. Trump and his team have repeatedly rejected any suggestions that federal firings impacted forecasting or emergency preparedness ahead of the floods.",
      "A\u00a0CBS News analysis found that 22 warnings from the National Weather Service were issued for Kerr County around the storms and flash flooding, which used escalating language as time went on. But some local residents said they did not receive emergency alerts on their phones nor did they understand how serious the situation had truly become until it actually happened.",
      "The San Antonio and San Angelo weather service offices issued warnings for the areas affected by flooding. Officials with the union representing National Weather Service workers told CBS News there are 23 meteorologists staffed between those offices, which together have 10 vacant positions.",
      "In San Antonio, the office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist, a vital role that essentially liaises between forecasters and emergency management agencies in the region to plan how information about an extreme weather event will be disseminated to the public, and which steps to take to protect them.",
      "Nim Kidd, the chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, said his office received a forecast Wednesday that predicted several inches of rain, but \"the amount of rain that fell at this specific location was never in any of those forecasts.\"",
      "Dalton Rice, the city manager for Kerrville, in Kerr County, said during the same briefing that the storm \"dumped more rain than what was forecasted.\"",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly said at a news conference July 4 that the county does \"not have a warning system\" in place to alert the public about weather emergencies. County officials had previously\u00a0discussed a public alarm system but did not proceed with it because of the cost. Former Kerr County commissioner Tom Moser told CBS News the county had applied for a grant in the past to build the system but the application was not approved.",
      "\"If they can't afford to do it, then let us do it,\" Lt. Gov. Patrick said Monday, noting that the state could offer resources for Kerr County to implement a system. \"We have a special session starting two weeks from today, and I think we can take that up and do some other things of funding these sirens. ... If there had been a siren, maybe that would have sparked people to say 'Oh, we have a massive disaster like five minutes away.'\"",
      "When asked about the emergency warnings on Tuesday, Abbott said everything would be discussed at the state Legislature session.",
      "\"We're going to address every aspect of this storm to make sure we're going to have in place the systems that are needed to prevent deadly flooding events like this in the future,\" he told reporters.",
      "The board of the Upper Guadalupe River Authority had secured funding and a contract to begin developing a flood monitoring system for the area, with preliminary meetings about the project scheduled for mid-July, according to the joint information center set up since the floods. That project aims to create a \"centralized dashboard to support local flood monitoring and emergency response,\" a spokesperson for the center said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"While real-time streamflow and rainfall data are already available through various sources, this new tool will bring those datasets for Kerr County into one platform to enhance usability for emergency managers,\" the statement said, adding, \"This is not a public alert system, but a decision-support resource intended to complement existing infrastructure.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 14 Jul 2025 05:00:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Several states have registries to prioritize help for vulnerable residents in natural disasters. But many disability advocates say they endanger people with mobility problems by giving a false sense of security.",
    "story": [
      "In the wake of January's deadly wildfires, Los Angeles County leaders are weighing a disaster registry intended to help disabled and senior residents get connected to emergency responders to bring them to safety during disasters.",
      "County supervisors approved a feasibility study this spring for such a voluntary database. Supporters applauded the effort to give more notice and assistance to the more than 1 million county residents with some type of disability, such as cognitive impairment or limited mobility.",
      "\"If we know that people perish in these situations, what are our answers?\" said Hilary Norton, who runs FASTLinkDTLA, a nonprofit focused on mobility issues. \"This is the time for people to really understand the magnitude for people in need when things like this happen.\"",
      "Amid the increasing frequency of natural disasters across the U.S. \u2014 brought into sharp relief by the recent deadly floods in Texas \u2014 state and local governments from Oregon to North Carolina have turned to disaster registries to prioritize help for vulnerable residents when fires, hurricanes, and other environmental catastrophes strike. But while some politicians say these registries are a potential solution to a public health problem, many disability advocates see them as ineffective tools that give people a false sense of security because there is no guarantee of evacuation help.",
      "\"They're described in a way that communicates that if you place your information in this registry and you will need assistance, they will be able to plan for it, so in a disaster you will be safer. And in reality, that is simply not the case,\" said Maria Town, president and CEO of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town, who has cerebral palsy, had been in Houston for six months when Hurricane Harvey hit in 2017. Texas makes a free registry called the State of Texas Emergency Assistance Registry available to cities and counties to help them identify needs in their communities, but how or if they use it is up to them. Fewer than 5% of people who registered were contacted during Harvey, and even fewer got evacuation assistance, according to a 2023 study by the National Council on Disability, a federal agency that advises on disability policies and programs. The hurricane took 89 lives.",
      "\"I heard people say, 'I thought I was safe. I registered,'\" Town said of the calls she got during and after Harvey.",
      "Neither the Texas Division of Emergency Management nor officials in Kerr County, the area hit hardest by the recent floods in Texas Hill Country, responded to questions about whether any accommodations were made for residents on the registry during the early July catastrophe.",
      "Many registries, like Florida's Special Needs Registry, expressly tell participants they still must make their own evacuation plans. The Florida Department of Health oversees the registry and, like in Texas, shares the information with local emergency management officials for their use. In North Carolina's Rockingham County, individuals must apply to be on the registry, and inclusion is not guaranteed. The registry page for Jackson and Josephine counties in Oregon warns that it can take up to three months for residents' information to be made available to rescue workers.",
      "The National Council on Disability says registries are harmful. \"They are ineffective and provide a false sense of security of future guaranteed assistance,\" Nicholas Sabula, a spokesperson for the organization, said in a statement.",
      "The California Governor's Office of Emergency Services also \"strongly discourages\" using registries, saying they can deter people from making their own disaster plans and raise privacy concerns. Disability advocates have also cited privacy as a concern.",
      "But Los Angeles politicians behind the registry effort insist they are worth looking into \u2014 at least a third of those who died in the Eaton Fire had issues that could affect their mobility and therefore their ability to flee in the face of disaster, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis. Anthony Mitchell Sr., an amputee in a wheelchair, and his 35-year-old son, Justin, who had cerebral palsy, were among the 18 people killed when the wildfire ripped through the Los Angeles County community of Altadena in January.",
      "Further driving the initiative is the aging of L.A. County's population: The California Department of Finance's Demographic Research Unit has estimated that more than a quarter of Los Angeles County residents will be 60 or over by 2030 \u2014 about 2.5 million people.",
      "Supervisor Kathryn Barger, who represents Altadena and proposed the registry study along with Supervisor Janice Hahn, \"wants to drill down and explore its usefulness,\" according to her communications director, Helen Chavez Garcia. Barger had not yet talked to the first responder community or had conversations about how emergency services would use the registry, according to Chavez Garcia.",
      "Victoria Jump, an assistant director at the county's Aging & Disabilities Department, is conducting the feasibility study \u2014 which she noted does not include cost estimates \u2014 and will make a recommendation to the Board of Supervisors this month on whether to support the project. The board will decide whether to move forward. Jump said she's gotten largely positive feedback in more than a dozen community sessions.",
      "It's not the first time Los Angeles has considered and even implemented a disaster registry. The county maintained a voluntary disaster registry called Specific Needs Awareness Planning, but acknowledged in 2016 that the program did \"not guarantee priority service to those who register\" and had a \"low return on investment.\" It was discontinued, and registrants were migrated to a mass emergency alert system called Alert LA County.",
      "\"We've been through this before with the county. It didn't work. It hasn't worked around the country,\" said Los Angeles resident June Kailes, a disability advocate who uses a power scooter.",
      "Kailes sees what happened in the Eaton Fire as a problem with emergency planning, saying that the county needs to better understand how to offer people with disabilities emergency transportation. She pointed to Galen Buckwalter, a paralyzed Eaton Fire survivor who reportedly drove his motorized wheelchair a mile in the dark to evacuate when he realized it would be impossible for a ride-hailing service to pick him up given the conditions.",
      "Norton, of the mobility nonprofit FASTLinkDTLA, said the registry needs to be about more than just collecting names of disabled residents. \"No one wants to create false hope,\" Norton said. \"It's an agreement to explore the possibilities. It's that balance of asking now, in order to make sure in the next disaster they are not left behind.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said Sunday that \"a turning point regarding Russia invasion of Ukraine is coming\" amid a bipartisan effort in Congress to impose new economic sanctions aimed at ramping up pressure on the Kremlin to end the war in Ukraine.",
      "\"For months, President Trump has tried to entice [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to the peace table. He's put tariffs against countries that allow fentanyl to come in our country, other bad behavior \u2014 he's left the door open regarding Russia. That door is about to close,\" Graham said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Graham outlined that he and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" are leading 85 cosponsors on a sanctions bill that he said would make a \"sledgehammer available to President Trump to go after Putin's economy and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine.\"",
      "The South Carolina Republican explained that countries like China, India and Brazil buy oil and other goods from Russia, saying \"that's the money Putin uses to prosecute the war.\" Graham said the sanctions package would give the president the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia. And he noted that the president would have the discretion to dial the tariffs up or down, giving him \"maximum flexibility.\"",
      "\"We're going after the people who keep Putin in business, and additional sanctions on Russia itself,\" Graham said. \"This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.\"",
      "Graham introduced the legislation in April, gaining momentum in recent weeks as Mr. Trump expressed frustration with Putin.",
      "After a call with the Russian leader earlier this month, Mr. Trump told reporters he was \"very disappointed\" and \"didn't make any progress.\" And Mr. Trump said last week that his administration would send more defensive weapons to Ukraine days after some weapons shipments were paused, as Russia pounded Ukraine with drone and missile attacks in what Ukraine described as the largest such attacks since the invasion began in February 2022.",
      "\"Putin is not treating human beings right. He's killing too many people,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday during a Cabinet meeting. \"So we're sending some defensive weapons to Ukraine, and I've approved that.\"",
      "The president also said during the Cabinet meeting that he is \"very strongly\" considering the sanctions bill.",
      "The measure appeared sidelined in recent weeks amid other priorities in Congress and as the White House sought changes to the measure that would grant more flexibility to the president on imposing the sanctions. But Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that GOP leaders have made \"substantial progress\" on the legislation, and he forecasted that the measure could be ready for consideration on the Senate floor as early as this work period, which ends Aug. 1.",
      "Graham and Blumenthal met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Europe late last week. The Ukrainian president praised the sanctions bill in a post on X after the meeting, saying \"Without a doubt, this is exactly the kind of leverage that can bring peace closer and make sure diplomacy is not empty.\"",
      "Blumenthal said Sunday that European leaders are \"absolutely in solidarity\" with the U.S. on the sanctions, saying \"bringing down this sledgehammer at this moment was emphasized by all of the European allies who were at the meeting that Sen. Graham and I attended in Europe.\"",
      "The Connecticut Democrat added that the language on the president's waiver authority in the legislation is similar to previous measures, allowing the president to act while also providing congressional oversight. He called the assurance \"very important\" to his Democratic colleagues.",
      "\"What is most important, I think, at this moment, is our unity,\" Blumenthal said. \"Sen. Graham and I, Republican and Democrat, coming together, the European leaders with diverse views, also in unity.\"",
      "The comments come as Mr. Trump is considering authorizing fresh funding for Ukraine for the first time since he took office in January, multiple diplomatic sources told CBS News. Asked about additional U.S. support for Ukraine, Graham teased an announcement the president is expected to make on Russia Monday, adding that \"the idea of America selling weapons to help Ukraine is very much in play.\"",
      "\"We've given Ukraine a lot,\" Graham said. \"We've given the money. We've given them military aid. We now have a minerals agreement with Ukraine that's worth trillions of dollars. So I don't want to get ahead of the president, but stay tuned about seized assets.\"",
      "Blumenthal also said Europeans leaders are making a plan to access at least part of the seized assets from Russia, noting that the $5 billion that the U.S. has seized could also be accessed. \"I think it's time to do it,\" Blumenthal said.",
      "Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who also appeared Sunday on \"Face the Nation,\" spearheaded legislation during the Biden administration giving the president authority to seize foreign assets. And although consensus couldn't previously be reached on the move, Hill said now is the time to act.",
      "\"I think it's time for the president to convert those seized assets to a trust account for the benefit of Ukraine,\" Hill said.",
      "No American president has ever seized the sovereign central bank assets of a country that the U.S. is not at war with. Former U.S. officials told CBS that the Biden administration declined to use that authority because of European opposition related to the unintended consequences on their own banking systems and economy that might result from seizing those state assets.",
      "Graham said he expects in the coming days \"you will see weapons flowing at a record level to help Ukraine defend themselves,\" along with new tariffs and sanctions available to Mr. Trump and more support from Europe.",
      "\"Putin made a miscalculation here,\" Graham said. \"For six months, President Trump tried to entice Putin to the table. The attacks have gone up, not down. One of the biggest miscalculations Putin has made is to play Trump.\"",

      "While online dating apps makes searching for love more convenient, finding that special person is as difficult as ever. A cute photo and simple \"hello\" may not be enough to help you break through the noise, which is why many of those feeling stuck on what to say are turning to artificial intelligence for assistance.",
      "According to a study\u00a0on singles in America released last month by dating app Match.com and The Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, 1 in 4 singles \u2014 and nearly half of Gen Z \u2014 use AI to up their dating game. That's a 333% increase from a year ago.",
      "\"People are turning to AI for literally any use case you could imagine,\" said Kasley Killam, a social health and human connection expert. \"And so it's inevitable that people are going to turn to AI for dating coaching.\"",
      "Capitalizing on the trend are AI dating assistants, which coach people on what to say, what tone to strike and how to keep the conversation flowing if it hits a lull. For individuals who feel writing isn't their strong suit, the technology can be a real confidence booster.",
      "Advice on what to say",
      "Roman Khaves, founder of a dating assistant app called Rizz \u2014 which is Gen Z-speak for \"charisma\" \u2014 said the service provides around-the-clock, objective advice for people who can't afford a human dating coach or are unable to reach their friends in a pinch.",
      "\"It'll never sleep on you,\" Khaves told CBS MoneyWatch, describing the app as an \"AI wingwoman or AI wingman in your pocket.\"",
      "Rizz works by letting users upload screenshots of their conversations from dating apps or social media. Rizz then suggests a reply using generative AI. The more you use Rizz, the more it understands what type of replies you tend to like or feel comfortable with. That trains the AI model to improve over time.",
      "Rizz has a user base of roughly 10 million, according to Khaves, and is composed of 65% men and 35% women, largely within the 18-to-25 age range.",
      "Another service, called Keepler, a dating-optimization app, has a feature that helps people navigate the dreaded practice known as \"ghosting,\" or when someone abruptly cuts off communication with someone without providing any explanation.",
      "One reason people ghost others is that they don't know the best way to let someone down easy, Keepler co-founder and CEO Rachel Abramowitz, told CBS MoneyWatch. Keepler's defense against ghosting is Keri, the app's in-house relationship guide.",
      "\"What we've built is a way to put in your raw, unedited feedback to Keri. Keri will rewrite it for you, and then you can send it to somebody,\" Abramowitz said.",
      "For those who have been ghosted, Keepler also allows users to request feedback from their vanishing date directly through the app, or have Keri help them write a message to send on their own.",
      "Abramowitz emphasizes that the app isn't aimed at providing therapy, but rather is there to offer support. With Keri, \"It really does feel like you have someone who is objective, who is on your side, who has no ulterior motives and really wants you to help reach your goals,\" she said.",
      "Last-gen dating apps are also getting into the AI game. Hinge and Grindr, two of the most popular dating apps, are taking steps to integrate AI into their platforms. In January, for example, Hinge introduced Prompt Feedback, an AI feature that provides users with immediate feedback on their profiles as they enter information.",
      "AI icebreaker",
      "The growing popularity of AI dating assistants gives rise to questions over authenticity as more users rely on the technology to convey their thoughts and feelings.",
      "One 36-year old Rizz user, who asked to remain anonymous to protect his privacy, told CBS MoneyWatch he could see why some people might find using AI to communicate disingenuous, but said he sees the tech simply as a way to stand out from the crowd.",
      "He also acknowledged that some of his dates appeared skeptical after he revealed to them that he was getting behind-the-scenes coaching from Rizz. But he still thinks the service is helpful as a conversation starter.",
      "\"For me personally, it's good for just initiating conversation, getting someone's attention, and then being able to just be myself after that,\" he said.",
      "Killam, the social health and human connection expert, said she thinks AI dating tools can be useful as long as people don't misrepresent who they are or lean on them too much.",

    "story": [
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell said Sunday the federal government must take responsibility for investigating the breakdown in flood warnings during the recent deadly storms in Texas, calling it a \"national responsibility\" to improve forecasting systems and prevent future disasters.",
      "\"It's not community to community. It's a national system,\" said Cantwell on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"And we share that with local people to help them best respond.\"",
      "Since the July 4 flash floods in Kerr County, Texas, officials have confirmed at least 129 people are dead and more than 170 remain missing as of Sunday morning. Over the weekend, search and recovery efforts were temporarily halted for the first time due to new flood threats, as additional rain and rising water levels prompted fresh warnings from the National Weather Service.",
      "The Washington Democrat, who chairs the Senate Commerce Committee, said Sunday that she plans to send a letter to President Trump outlining bipartisan recommendations to upgrade the country's forecasting infrastructure. Among them are improvements to Doppler radar, increased use of ocean buoys to track sea temperatures, and enhanced data analytics and computing power for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "\"What the real question is, is what can we do to improve the weather forecasting of this nation,\" Cantwell said. \"To use science, to use better assets, to really do a once in a lifetime investment to upgrade the system.\"",

      "The senator also warned against proposed budget cuts and privatization efforts under the Trump administration, which she said could undermine NOAA's mission. During the Texas floods, key forecasting and IT positions at the National Weather Service were unfulfilled, according to the union that represents NWS staffers. The vacancies raise questions about whether staffing shortages may have contributed to delays in emergency alerts.",

      "Cantwell said she hasn't decided whether she will vote to confirm NOAA administrator nominee Dr. Neil Jacobs. The senator said she was pleased in a Senate hearing this week that Jacobs made \"some very positive\" commitments about supporting the Organic Act, which is aimed at establishing the NOAA as an independent agency. Before making a decision, Cantwell said she wants to \"drill down\" on Jacobs' thoughts about how to preserve the science mission amid increased spending on storms.",

    "published": "Sat, 12 Jul 2025 22:27:08 -0400",
    "summary": "Tensions that simmered for months boiled over when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement this week saying that they had concluded that Jeffrey Epstein did not possess a \"client list.\"",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department and FBI are struggling to contain the fallout from this week's decision to withhold records from the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking investigation, which rankled influential far-right media personalities and supporters of President Trump.",
      "The move, which included the acknowledgment that one particular sought-after document never actually existed, sparked a contentious conversation between Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino at the White House this week. The spat threatened to shatter relations between them and centered in part on a news story that described divisions between the FBI and the Justice Department.",
      "The cascade of disappointment and disbelief arising from the refusal to disclose additional, much-hyped records from the Epstein investigation underscores the struggles of FBI and Justice Department leaders to resolve the conspiracy theories and amped-up expectations that they themselves had stoked with claims of a cover-up and hidden evidence. Infuriated by the failure of officials to unlock, as promised, the secrets of the so-called \"deep state,\" Trump supporters on the far right have grown restless and even demanded change at the top.",
      "Mr. Trump expressed frustration in a lengthy social media posting on Saturday over the divide among diehards of his \"Make America Great Again\" movement over the matter, and expressed support for Bondi. His lengthy post made no mention of Bongino.",
      "\"What's going on with my 'boys' and, in some cases, 'gals?'\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"They're all going after Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is doing a FANTASTIC JOB! We're on one Team, MAGA, and I don't like what's happening.\"",
      "He later said: \"One year ago our Country was DEAD, now it's the 'HOTTEST' Country anywhere in the World. Let's keep it that way, and not waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\"",
      "Tensions that simmered for months boiled over on Monday when the Justice Department and FBI issued a two-page statement saying that they had concluded that Epstein did not possess a \"client list,\" even though Bondi had intimated in February that such a document was sitting on her desk, and had decided against releasing any additional records from the investigation.",
      "The department did disclose a video meant to prove that Epstein killed himself in jail, but even that raised the eyebrows of conspiracy theorists because of a missing minute in the recording.",
      "It was hardly the first time that Trump administration officials have failed to fulfill their pledge to deliver the evidence that supporters had come to expect.",
      "In February, conservative influencers were invited to the White House and provided with binders marked \"The Epstein Files: Phase 1\" and \"Declassified.\" But the binders contained information that had largely already been in the public domain.",
      "Afterward, Bondi said an FBI \"source\" informed her of the existence of thousands of pages of previously undisclosed documents and ordered the bureau to provide the \"full and complete Epstein files.\" She later said officials were poring over a \"truckload\" of previously withheld evidence she said had been handed over by the FBI.",
      "But after a months-long review of evidence in the government's possession, the Justice Department determined in the memo Monday that no \"further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.\" The department noted that much of the material was placed under seal by a court to protect victims, and \"only a fraction\" of it \"would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial.\"",
      "The Trump administration had hoped that that statement would be the final word on the saga, with Mr. Trump chiding a reporter who asked Bondi about the Epstein case at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.",
      "However, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News that Bondi and Bongino got into a confrontation over the public rollout of the Epstein review during a White House meeting Wednesday. Also in the meeting was White House chief of staff Susie Wiles.",
      "Bongino did not show up to work on Friday, according to the sources.",
      "The news publication Axios was first to describe the conversation.",
      "Also Friday, far-right activist Laura Loomer, who is close to Mr. Trump, posted on X that she was told that Bongino was \"seriously thinking about resigning\" and had taken the day off to contemplate his future. Bongino is normally an active presence on social media but has been silent since Wednesday.",
      "The FBI did not respond to a request seeking comment, and the White House sought in a statement to minimize any tensions.",
      "\"President Trump has assembled a highly qualified and experienced law and order team dedicated to protecting Americans, holding criminals accountable, and delivering justice to victims,\" said spokesman Harrison Fields. \"This work is being carried out seamlessly and with unity. Any attempt to sow division within this team is baseless and distracts from the real progress being made in restoring public safety and pursuing justice for all.\"",

      "Flash floods in Texas killed more than 130 people over the Fourth of July holiday weekend, including girls attending a summer camp, and left dozens of others still missing. On Monday, Camp Mystic confirmed at least 27 campers and counselors had died in the flooding.",
      "The devastation along the Guadalupe River, west of Austin and northwest of San Antonio, has drawn a massive search effort as officials face questions over their preparedness and the speed of their initial actions.",
      "Here's what to know about the deadly flooding, the colossal weather system that drove it in and around Kerr County, Texas, and ongoing efforts to identify victims.",
      "Massive rain hit at just the wrong time, in a flood-prone place",
      "The floods grew to their worst at the midpoint of a long holiday weekend when many people were asleep.",
      "The Texas Hill Country in the central part of the state is naturally prone to flash flooding due to the dry dirt-packed areas where the soil lets rain skid along the surface of the landscape instead of soaking it up. An area of cliffs and steep hills called the Balcones Escarpment is also a factor.",
      "\"When warm air from the Gulf rushes up the escarpment, it condenses and can dump a lot of moisture. That water flows down the hills quickly, from many different directions, filling streams and rivers below,\" Hatim Sharif, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at The University of Texas at San Antonio, wrote in an article in The Conversation.",
      "In addition to the geography, multiple weather factors contributed to Friday's heavy rainfall, meteorologists say.",
      "\"First and foremost, you had Barry,\" a tropical system that had made landfall in eastern Mexico early last week and was weakening, CBS News Philadelphia meteorologist Kate Bilo said Monday.",
      "Moisture from that system was lifted northward \"right on up into Texas,\" Bilo said. There were also other weather systems \u2014 a low-level jet stream and an upper-level disturbance \u2014 adding more moisture.",
      "\"Nothing was really moving so you just had all of this rain coming down over the same areas and heavy, heavy rainfall rates because of all of that deep, deep moisture in the atmosphere,\" Bilo explained.",
      "After a flood watch notice midday Thursday, the National Weather Service office issued an urgent warning around 4 a.m. that raised the potential of catastrophic damage and a severe threat to human life. By at least 5:20 a.m., some in the Kerrville City area said water levels were getting alarmingly high. The massive rain flowing down hills sent rushing water into the Guadalupe River, causing it to rise 26 feet in just 45 minutes.",
      "Death toll is expected to rise as dozens remain missing",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott said there were dozens of people unaccounted for across the state and more could be missing.",
      "In Kerr County, home to youth camps in the Texas Hill Country, at least 106 people, including more than 30 children, have died, officials said",
      "There were more than 160 people known to be missing a week after the floods hit, officials said. The missing included five girls and a counselor from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the river, Abbott said during a news conference, as well as one child not associated with the camp.",
      "The campers who died include 8-year-old Linnie McCown of Austin, 8-year-old Eloise Peck of Dallas and 9-year-old Lila Bonner of Dallas, their families said. Chloe Childress, an 18-year-old counselor from the Houston area, also died in the floods, according to the Kinkaid School, where she had recently graduated.",
      "Camp Mystic's owner and director, Dick Eastland, died while trying to save girls at the camp, according to local media reports. The obituary section of the Kerrville community news site was dotted with tributes to victims, including Eastland.",
      "Officials face scrutiny over flash flood warnings",
      "Survivors have described the floods as a \"pitch black wall of death\" and said they received no emergency warnings.",
      "Kerr County Judge Rob Kelly, who lives along the Guadalupe River, said Saturday that \"nobody saw this coming.\" Various officials have referred to it as a \"100-year flood,\" meaning the water levels were highly unlikely based on the historical record.",
      "And records behind those statistics don't always account for human-caused climate change. Though it's hard to connect specific storms to a warming planet so soon after they occur, meteorologists say a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and allow severe storms to dump even more rain.",
      "Additionally, officials have come under scrutiny about why residents and youth summer camps along the river were not alerted sooner than 4 a.m. or told to evacuate.",
      "Officials noted that the public can grow weary from too many flooding alerts or forecasts that turn out to be minor.",
      "Kelly said authorities were shocked by the ferocity of the floods. \"We had no reason to believe that this was gonna be any, anything like what's happened here. None whatsoever,\" Kelly told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "Kerr County officials said they had presented a proposal for a more robust flood warning system, similar to a tornado warning system, but that members of the public reeled at the cost. Tom Moser, a former Kerr County commissioner, told CBS News the county had previously applied for a grant to build the system, but it wasn't approved, leading to concerns about the local budget if the county were to try to fund the system alone. He also noted there was local resistance over the possibility that the sirens could inadvertently be triggered, causing unwanted noise in the community.",
      "Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick told CBS News on Monday that the state could possibly step in to fund the system.",
      "\"If they can't afford to do it, then let us do it,\" he said, adding: \"We have a special session starting two weeks from today, and I think we can take that up and do some other things of funding these sirens.\"",
      "On Sunday, officials walked out of a news briefing after reporters asked them again about delays in alerts and evacuations.",
      "Search for victims and monumental cleanup",
      "Crews are searching urgently for the missing. Volunteers, search dogs and drones have joined the effort, with some rescuers maneuvering through challenging terrain filled with snakes.",
      "U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem\u00a0said in a social media post\u00a0that the U.S. Coast Guard was responsible for saving more than 200 people, as dramatic\u00a0video\u00a0showed Guard members conducting aerial rescues near Kerrville while dark water covered the ground.",
      "The flash floods have erased campgrounds and torn homes from their foundations.",
      "\"It's going to be a long time before we're ever able to clean it up, much less rebuild it,\" Kelly said Saturday after surveying the destruction from a helicopter.",
      "Other massive flooding events have driven residents and business owners to give up, including in areas struck last year by Hurricane Helene.",
      "President Trump signed a major disaster declaration Sunday for Kerr County and said he would likely visit Friday: \"I would have done it today, but we'd just be in their way.\"",
      "\"It's a horrible thing that took place, absolutely horrible,\" he told reporters.",
      "At the Vatican, Pope Leo extended a prayer to the flooding victims during Sunday Mass, saying: \"I express my sincere condolences to all the families who have lost loved ones, in particular their daughters who were at summer camp, in the disaster caused by the flooding of the Guadalupe river in Texas in the United States.\"",

      "The rise of generative AI is making it harder for recent college graduates to get a foothold on the corporate ladder as they start their careers.",
      "Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to young grads have declined 15%, while the number of applications per job has surged 30%, according to data from Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z workers.",
      "Although people fresh out of college often struggle to land entry-level positions in their chosen field, \"there are early warning signs\" that AI is taking jobs away from the least experienced\u00a0 workers, Doug Calidas, senior vice president of government affairs for Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on emerging technologies, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The unemployment rate for recent college graduates being unusually high seems relevant,\" he said.",
      "As of March, the U.S. unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 through 27 was 5.8%, considerably higher than the nation's overall 4% jobless rate at the time,\u00a0according\u00a0to the New York Federal Reserve.",
      "To be sure, most recent college grads are finding work, Calidas emphasized, adding that the latest job figures point to a \"deterioration,\" not a collapse, in opportunities for young people.",
      "Still, \"It's tough for students who feel like they have done the right thing their whole lives \u2014 they went into STEM careers or computer science because they expected software hiring to grow and grow, and that may not happen,\" he said.",

Despite applying for roughly 200 positions, he has yet to land a job in his chosen field. For now, he's working as an assistant pool director at the Lake Isle Country Club in Eastchester, New York, his hometown.",
      "\"I was told by a lot of people, that I was going to get a job right out of college,\" he told CBS News' Ali Bauman. \"And then all of a sudden, there's no jobs.\"",
      "AI redefining the entry-level job",
      "Experts say that because AI is currently best at the kind of rote, repetitive tasks that are a staple of entry-level work, the very nature of what such roles consist of is likely to change.",
      "\"The AI piece is becoming more integrated, which is requiring a redefinition of what an entry-level role looks like and the types of skills that might be be needed,\" Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"So it's critical for new graduates to make sure they are exposing themselves to AI and learning how to use it.\"",
      "Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using \"AI\" in job descriptions, according to Handshake.",
      "Liya Palagashvili, a labor economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch that jobs with low barriers to entry are being swallowed by AI. She points to a 2024\u00a0study\u00a0by researchers at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School, Purdue University, and Stanford Graduate School of Business showing that generative AI is weighing on hiring in occupations that require little education, knowledge or training.",
      "\"Any job requiring lower levels or skills or training, that's where we are seeing a reduction in hiring due to an exposure to generative AI,\" Palagashvili said.",
      "By contrast, the study found that, since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for workers in occupations requiring a higher level of knowledge and training has risen.",
      "\"So you're seeing a two-segmented market thing going on with ChatGPT having a positive effect on occupations with higher barriers to labor entry, and having a negative effect on occupations that have low barriers to entry,\" Palagashvili said. \"The latest empirical evidence shows hiring is down in low-skilled occupations, but high in those that require a\u00a0 higher skill level.\"",
      "New technologies have always shaped the labor market, snuffing out certain professions while breathing life into new sectors. One difference with the rise of AI that the technology excels at job functions typically associated with white-collar work.",
      "The acceleration of AI could push more young people into skilled trades that don't require a high-priced college education, Calidas said.",
      "\"Since the automation that began in the 1970s, a lot of manual jobs have gone away,\" he said. \"For a few generations, it's been an article of faith that white-collar jobs are more safe, whereas blue-collar work is more precarious. There's been a cultural push toward sending people to college, but it might make more sense to go into the trades.\"",

      "That underscores questions about the accuracy of information being released by America's top public health agency following widespread staff cuts in recent months, experts said.",
      "\"For any of the national health organizations now being decimated by firings (and) layoffs, I am going to be skeptical of data updates until there is transparency and clarity on the source of the data and analysis,\" said Christopher Gardner, an expert in diabetes and nutrition at Stanford University.",
      "The new analysis used \"the latest science and technologies\" and \"the most updated methodology as science is continually evolving,\" said Melissa Dibble, a CDC spokesperson.",
      "\"These new data highlight the magnitude of prediabetes among adolescents and serve as a critical wake-up call for the nation,\" Dibble said in a statement.",
      "The new analysis relied on the long-running National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which collects information on demographic and health indicators via interviews, examinations and laboratory testing.",
      "Prediabetes is a precursor to diabetes, a disease in which sugar builds up in the blood. Prediabetes is characterized by slightly elevated blood sugar levels, indicating that a person may progress to developing Type 2 diabetes.",
      "The researchers collected data about blood sugar levels in U.S. youth \u2014 but they also changed the methodology used to analyze the information, dramatically increasing the estimate of how common prediabetes is.",
      "The new analysis concludes that about 8.4 million U.S. adolescents \u2014 or nearly 33% \u2014 have prediabetes. That's up from an estimate of 18% published in a 2020 peer-reviewed paper, which used the previous methodology. If the new methodology had been applied to that 2005-2016 data, the estimate would have been about 28%.",
      "The increase from 28% to nearly 33% is not statistically significant, even though it reflects an apparent rise in prediabetes among kids, said Steven Kahn, a diabetes researcher at the UW Medicine in Seattle and editor-in-chief of the journal Diabetes Care. He said it's concerning that CDC officials provided such limited information about the new analysis. Such findings typically have been published in the agency's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report or submitted to a scientific journal for peer review and publication.",
      "\"I would like to believe it doesn't diminish the quality of CDC data,\" said Kahn. \"However, because there's no raw data to look at, none of us can look at it to better understand where these numbers are derived from and what they really mean.\"",
      "Dr. Samar Hafida, an endocrinologist and representative for the American Diabetes Association, said the new analysis \"wasn't very transparent,\" but she noted that the CDC's updated estimate generally squares with what doctors are seeing \u2014 an increase in youth with obesity and elevated blood sugar levels that put them at risk for serious future health problems.",
      "\"It could be that maybe the number slightly inflated, but I would hesitate to dismiss it,\" she said.",
      "It remains unclear what proportion of kids with prediabetes will go on to develop the disease, noted Dr. Dana Dabelea, a researcher who studies pediatric diabetes at the University of Colorado. Blood sugar levels can rise in response to developmental changes during puberty and then resolve later, she said.",
      "Still, confirmed rates of obesity and diabetes among kids are rising.",
      "The diabetes association recommends that children and adolescents should be screened for Type 2 diabetes starting at age 10 if they are overweight or have obesity or another risk factor for the disease. Focusing on healthy diet, exercise and other lifestyle factors is key, noted Hafida.",
      "\"It's still a call to action,\" she said. \"There will likely be a surge in early onset Type 2 diabetes that we are not prepared to deal with.\"",

      "\"We are laser-focused on fixing the root cause of the problem,\" said Quinn, who defended the agency's decision not to dismiss anyone after the security failure on July 13, 2024, in which a gunman opened fire during a campaign rally and a bullet grazed Mr. Trump's ear. One person was killed and two others were wounded while the alleged gunman, Thomas Crooks, was killed by a Secret Service sniper.",
      "\"We aren't going to fire our way out of this,\" Quinn said in an interview Wednesday. \"We're going to focus on the root cause and fix the deficiencies that put us in that situation.\"",
      "\"Secret Service is totally accountable for Butler,\" he said. \"Butler was an operational failure and we are focused today on ensuring that it never happens again.\"",
      "Quinn said the personnel were disciplined according to a federally mandated process. Quinn told CBS News the agency has been focused on addressing the root causes of the operational failures that played out in Butler. To do that, the Secret Service introduced a new fleet of military grade drones and mobile command posts that allows agents to communicate over radio directly with local law enforcement \u2014 interoperability that didn't exist last year.",
      "The assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and a second, foiled attempt against Mr. Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida, a few weeks later, spurred the resignation of then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle and triggered several investigations and contentious congressional hearings.",
      "A bruising 180-page report released by a bipartisan House task force in December found that the security lapses that led to the first incident were \"not isolated to the campaign event itself.\"",
      "The lawmakers noted that \"preexisting issues in leadership and training created an environment\" in which the failures could occur, like giving significant responsibilities to Secret Service personnel with little to no experience in advanced planning roles. Lawmakers also noted a lack of coordination and planning between the Secret Service and its law enforcement partners.",
      "\"The events of July 13, 2024, were tragic and preventable, and the litany of related security failures are unacceptable,\" the report said.",

      "Just six inches of fast-moving water can knock an adult off their feet and carry them away, experts say. If you end up in the water in a flash flood, there is very little you can do to survive, Dworkin and other rescue experts said.",
      "\"It is very difficult to combat nature. Survival can be attributed to luck as much as your actions,\" Chris Susi, president of the International Association of Water Rescue Professionals, said.",
      "The volume, speed and depth of the water in these situations make it incredibly dangerous.",
      "\"There's a difference between being caught in a flood that's relatively still water and water that is just moving extremely fast,\" said Alan Plastow, a captain on the Ohio Special Response Team.",
      "And debris presents additional hazards. \"It's not just a drowning incident, it's trauma as well,\" Dworkin said.",
      "What to do in a flash flood \u2014 and how to prepare",
      "If you're caught in a flash flood, Susi's advice is to get on your back with your feet up in front of you to try to push away obstacles and back stroke toward the side of the river.",
      "\"The water will move slower toward the edges and you need to be trying to find a way out of the water,\" Susi said. \"You will not overpower the water, and obstacles can very easily pin you. Fast moving flood water is very difficult to swim in and focus should be to stay afloat and look for a way out.\"",
      "But, the priority should be avoidance \u2014 and to have plans in place for natural disasters, the experts say.",
      "People \"simply don't know what to do, and so they have a reactive response instead of a planned response,\" Plastow said.",
      "Plastow recommended getting a weather radio, as cell service can be faulty and people may not receive the warnings from the National Weather Service on their phones. He recommended both a plug-in and battery-operated radio with extra batteries available.",
      "People also need to understand the various levels of warnings. Here's how the NWS defines its flood warnings:",
      "Flash flood warning: issued when a flash flood is imminent or occurring\u00a0Flood warning: issued when flooding is imminent or occurringFlood watch: issued when conditions are favorable for floodingFlood advisory: issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning, but it may cause significant inconvenience and caution is recommended",
      "Flash flood warning: issued when a flash flood is imminent or occurring",
      "Flood warning: issued when flooding is imminent or occurring",
      "Flood watch: issued when conditions are favorable for flooding",
      "Flood advisory: issued when flooding is not expected to be bad enough to issue a warning, but it may cause significant inconvenience and caution is recommended",
      "\"When it jumps from advisory to watch, you need to be taking action right away because things are about to happen,\" Plastow said.",
      "If a warning is issued, the primary advice from experts and federal agencies is to get to high ground as quickly as possible, but high ground may not be close by.",
      "\"If you get to a point where you don't believe you can escape to high ground, get as high as you can first, and then dial 911,\" Susi said. \"Your goal should be to find a way to not end up in the water.\"",
      "If you are in your home or a building, move to a high floor, but ensure there is a way to signal to rescuers that you are there.",
      "\"If you're going up into the attic, and there's no way to signal to anybody that you're up there, that's going to be a dangerous place to be,\" Dworkin said.",
      "Plastow recommended having an axe or other non-electric cutting device in an attic in case you need to cut your way to the roof.",
      "Having a \"go-bag\" prepared with weeks worth of water, meal replacement bars or MRE (meals ready to eat) kits, medications, changes of clothing, water-proof flashlights, batteries and life jackets \"will go a long way toward helping people when disaster hits,\" Plastow said. He also recommended having an infrared strobe that can alert search and rescue personnel to where you are.",
      "Drivers: \"Turn around, don't drown\"",
      "If you're in a car, \"the important thing is, never attempt to cross a flooded roadway,\" because you don't know how deep the water is or what the integrity of the road is under the water, Dworkin said.",
      "\"Turn around, don't drown,\" is often the phrase officials repeat to remind the public to avoid flooded roads. About a foot of fast-moving water can carry away a small car and 18-24 inches can carry away most large SUVs, vans and trucks, the NWS warns.",
      "If you are in danger of having a submerged vehicle, Dworkin said to open your window, take off your seat belt and get children and yourself out of the vehicle as quickly as possible.",
      "\"If your vehicle is caught in moving water, the safest thing would be to get out of your vehicle, and the only avenue you're going to have at that point is to get onto the roof of the vehicle and hopefully wait for a rescue,\" he said, but he warned that can be very difficult.",
      "The bottom line, Plastow said, is people need to be aware of their surroundings and be prepared before a flood hits.",
      "\"These so-called once-in-a-generation events are happening more and more often in recent years,\" he said. \"So one of the things we have to do is recalibrate how we predict the frequency of these events and base that on our our capability to respond.\"",

The incident was announced just two days after a bomb strapped to a donkey exploded in the same area, killing one soldier and wounding two others.",
      "The anti-explosive canine, named Sanson, was helping troops conduct a reconnaissance operation in Antioquia, a mountainous region in northwest Colombia, when the bomb exploded, the army said Friday in a social media post. Authorities said the bomb had been planted on a \"community-used path\" by the National Liberation Army, known by its Spanish language acronym ELN.",

      "Excavations begin Monday of an unmarked mass burial site at a former mother and baby home in western Ireland suspected of containing the remains of hundreds of infants and young children.",
      "The planned two-year probe by Irish and foreign experts in Tuam comes more than a decade after an amateur historian first uncovered evidence of a mass grave there.",
      "Subsequent 2016-2017 test excavations found significant quantities of baby remains in a subterranean disused septic tank at the location, which now sits within a housing complex.",
      "Scientists say the remains are largely mixed together, the BBC reports, and a number of methods will be used to try to put remains back together and, where possible, identify them.",
      "Catholic nuns ran a so-called \"mother and baby\" institution there between 1925 and 1961, housing women who had become pregnant outside of marriage and been shunned by their families.",
      "After giving birth, some children lived in the homes too but many more were given up for adoption under a system that often saw church and state work in tandem.",
      "The history of unwed mothers forced into hard labor is a\u00a0well-documented dark chapter in Irish history. Oppressive and misogynistic, the institutions -- which operated nationwide, some not closing until as recently as 1998 -- represent a dark chapter in the history of once overwhelmingly Catholic and socially conservative Ireland.",
      "A six-year enquiry sparked by the initial discoveries in Tuam found 56,000 unmarried women and 57,000 children passed through 18 such homes over a 76-year period.",
      "It also concluded that 9,000 children had died in the various state- and Catholic Church-run homes nationwide.",
      "Records unearthed show as many as 796 babies and young children died at the Tuam home over the decades that it operated.",
      "Its grounds have been left largely untouched after the institution was knocked down in 1972 and housing was built there.",

      "Corrigan told the BBC that the start of the excavation was \"both welcome and difficult.\"",
      "\"While it's a relief to see work started on the site, it's really only the latest stage in what is still a long road for all of us,\" she said. \"I won't rest until I see justice for my two brothers who not only need a proper Christian burial but also the full rigors of the law applied.\"",
      "Annette McKay, whose mother Maggie was sent to the home in Tuam when she was 17,\u00a0 told BBC Radio program that she believes her older sister Mary Margaret's remains could be in the mass grave.",
      "\"Mum's grave still doesn't have her name on the headstone,\" she told BBC Radio. \"It has my brother's and it has my stepfather's and I was the one that said 'let's wait for Mary Margaret'.\"",

      "It will involve exhumation, analysis, identification if possible, and re-interment of the remains found, its director Daniel MacSweeney told a recent press conference in Tuam.",
      "It follows local historian Catherine Corless in 2014 producing evidence that the 796 children -- from newborns to a nine-year-old -- had died at the home.",
      "State-issued death certificates she compiled show that various ailments, from tuberculosis and convulsions to measles and whooping cough, were listed as the cause of death.",
      "Corless's research indicated the corpses were likely placed in the disused septic tank discovered in 1975, while prompting the state-backed enquiries that have uncovered the full scandal of the homes.",

      "European markets mostly fell Monday as investors digested President Trump's latest trade war salvos, which saw him threaten to hit the European Union and Mexico with 30% tariffs starting on August 1. Mr. Trump's threat came after a series of announcements last week that included warnings of a possible 50% levy on all copper imports and all goods from Brazil, 35% levies on Canadian goods, and a possible 200% tariff on imported pharmaceuticals.",
      "In announcing his latest intentions on Saturday, Mr. Trump cited Mexico's role in illicit drugs flowing into the United States and a trade imbalance with the European Union.",

      "Mr. Trump is also facing calls from Republicans and Democrats, as well as European allies, to support legislation in the Senate that aims to cripple Russia's oil industry and hit Moscow with U.S. sanctions for its ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The legislation, in part, calls for a 500% tariff on goods imported from countries that continue to buy Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports. It would have an enormous impact on economic behemoths China and India, which account for roughly 70% of Russia's energy trade.",

      "\"This congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia, and props up Putin's war machine,\" Graham said. \"He can dial it up or down. He can go to 0%, to 500%. He has maximum flexibility. But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. French Hill, Republican of Arkansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to Congressman French Hill. He is the chair of the House Financial Services Committee. Welcome back to the broadcast. Your ears must have been ringing with the two senators who started the program, because they were talking about grabbing some of those frozen Russian assets. You moved a bill and gave the president authority to actually seize them during the last administration, under the REPO Act. The U.S. has never before seized central bank assets from another country. Do you know if the Treasury Department is going to do so now?",
      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Well, Margaret, it's good to be with you. Yes, I certainly worked very hard with former Foreign Affairs Chairman Mike McCaul and others to put that in our 2024 national security package during the Biden administration, because we wanted another arrow in the quiver for the president to not just seize those assets, but to convert them to the benefit of Ukraine. But we could never get consensus between the United States and Europe for doing that, despite a unanimous vote of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe supporting it. So I continued to urge President Biden to do that. We got the interest off those frozen assets to benefit Ukraine, but I think it's time for the president to convert those seized assets to a trust account for the benefit of Ukraine. I'm glad to hear both Senators Blumenthal and Graham support that idea. It's time to do it, and I've encouraged Secretary Bessent that this should be a priority for President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On another topic, because you have some oversight in the financial space, I want to ask you about comments made in regard to Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The president says the economy is in good shape, but he still complains about the head of the central bank, says he's doing a terrible job because he's not lowering interest rates. On another network today, the president's top economic adviser said the White House is looking into whether the president has the authority to fire Chair Powell. Do you believe the president has the power and authority to fire the Fed president?",
      "REP. HILL: You know, Margaret, I don't, and I believe President Trump has spoken about this several times over the past few years, including recently. Mr. Powell's governorship, his chairmanship, is up next spring. The president has vacancies coming up on the Fed board, where he could name another governor. But look, just because Congress created the Fed and that we believe that it should be independent in the setting of monetary policy, it doesn't mean that it's immune from criticism. And every president since World War Two has had choice words for the Fed chair when they've not been in sync with the direction of the president. So look, the Congress continues to do oversight. I set up a special task force to oversee the Fed's decision making since the 2008 financial crisis. We have that investigation, review, and oversight underway, and we'll continue it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think you'd acknowledge that most presidents might have those choice words behind closed doors, not on social media posts on a regular basis, Congressman. But on crypto, I want to ask you. Crypto has been the Wild West, right, in many ways, because they don't have the same kind of regulation in the digital asset space that there does exist for banks and financial services. You've got a few measures coming up this week.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you make sure, as you put these regulations in place that kind of help crypto become more mainstream, that it doesn't also benefit some of those on the black market, for example, who use this to evade oversight?",
      "REP. HILL: Exactly. Well, in the work in the Senate led by Bill Hagerty and Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis on the GENIUS Act to create a dollar-backed stablecoin, we've heavily influenced that legislation over the two years of previous work by the House and our Clarity Act, which sets up the rules of the road for what's a commodity, what's a security, how to use digital assets, how to store them, how to custody them. These are the rules that will protect consumers, will limit access to our market and our investors from entities outside the United States trying to influence the crypto markets. We have none of that today. What we've had is a mismatch of rules by enforcement in the Biden administration, and I believe the bills we'll have on the House floor this week will protect investors, consumers, and make America, as President Trump wants, a leader in financial technology and crypto and digital assets innovation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, sir, that the concern is that this is the patina of protection of consumers without actual muscle behind it. It was interesting to see, and many Americans who hold mortgages might have noticed, that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac who buy and sell mortgages, that the head of the agency, the Federal Housing Agency, Bill Pulte, told them they'll have to prepare a proposal to review crypto as an asset on mortgage applications.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Given the huge taxpayer stake in Fannie, Freddie, are you comfortable with people using crypto, something that isn't really, you know, tangible in many ways, to pay for a down payment on a house?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, look at Bitcoin, for example. One can now buy Bitcoin. It is a commodity. It's been determined that it's a commodity by the CFTC and the SEC. One can hold it in their brokerage account through an exchange-traded product, an ETF, ETP. It's now an asset for millions of Americans, and it certainly could be treated like a stock or a bond or cash as a contribution to someone's net worth to qualify for a mortgage. And if we pass Clarity this week, which I expect we will on a bipartisan basis, and we craft a dollar-backed stablecoin like GENIUS offered by Senator Hagerty, we'll have the rules of the road. It won't be a patina of consumer enforcement. It will be real consumer enforcement, investor protection--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --And the down payment for a house--",
      "REP. HILL: --both by the CFTC, the SEC, and the bank, and the bank regulators. Well, look again. Bitcoin is an asset. You can determine if you think it's going to go up in value or down in value, just like stocks and bonds or other investments that people have on their financial statement to secure their financial statement for a net- for net worth purposes or to liquidate for a down payment. So, I think it's a financial asset. Our bills will make it a more secure one, and one that's better for, I think, all households and businesses.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Thank you. Thank you for having",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Today is the one-year mark since then-candidate Trump was shot at in Butler, Pennsylvania. You have released an Accountability Report, we've had a look at it, and it details that assets were requested by the Secret Service, including requests made over the phone, and they were denied. You also say that the former Secret Service director made false claims under oath when Kimberly Cheadle said there were no denials. Was she misled, or are you accusing her of lying?",
      "SEN. PAUL: She did not tell the truth. She said that there were no assets that were requested in advance. We found at least four occasions, actually, maybe five occasions, where requests were made. The primary request that was made by both Trump's Secret Service detail, as well as his campaign was for counter-snipers. Counter-snipers were denied until Butler. So, thank God, on that day in Butler County, Pennsylvania, that was the first time he was allowed counter-snipers. If he had not had counter-snipers, that assassin would have popped up again- he did pop up again to continue firing, and that's when he was taken out. But, thank God we had the counter-snipers there. But why were they denied for months and months? When they finally did ask for them, they mysteriously, magically appeared. They found them where they needed them. They just weren't trying hard enough. So, it was a cascade of errors. It was just one error after another. When we talked to the people in charge of security, everybody pointed a finger at someone else. We said, who was responsible for that roof, the roof where the assassin lay with a direct sight line. Nobody wanted responsibility. Everybody said it was somebody else. There was plenty of time to take him off the stage. The suspicious person with the range finder who became the shooter, many times he was spotted by police with suspicion. That should have been enough to take the president off the stage. Even with him on the roof, there was about a three-minute period when he could have been taken from the stage. And yet, no one was fired. Some of these people could be in charge of security for another presidential candidate. And, really, that's a danger that someone- one of the people that were in charge at Butler, could be in charge again. That's not right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President United States has said he is satisfied with the answers he's received in regard to what went wrong. But, back on the point about not telling the truth to Congress: The report found that there were 10 occasions where resources were requested and denied or not filled. And, in fact, when it came to Butler, the counter-surveillance drone request was made over the phone. So, when you say someone is not telling the truth, is it that there was no record of requests and denials? Was this knowingly misleading Congress? Or was this like a culture of cover-up within the agency?",
      "SEN. PAUL \u00a0I think it was a cultural cover-up for the agency. They did not want to assess blame. They did not want to look internally. And they wanted to discount any of their actions that might have led to this. This was a cover your ass sort of moment, and I do believe that they did know. There's no way that the director of Secret Service, that she did not know that these requests had been made. And, so, yes, it was a huge failure. And, if you talk to the current head of the Secret Service, who was Trump's lead detail, and Trump has a great deal of confidence in, he'll admit that these failures existed. But even the disciplinary action that they finally took. They only took because I subpoenaed. I wanted to know who was disciplined. We weren't going to release the names, but I wanted to know who was disciplined and what the discipline was. They refused for a year to tell me that. They told me that a week ago, you saw the news reports, but some of the people were just disciplined two weeks ago, so they weren't going to discipline anybody until I subpoenaed and asked them what they had done. But, in the end, no one was fired. The supervisor who heard about the person on the roof, who did not tell the detail immediately to take the president off the stage, there was a several-minute delay there. He stayed in his job. He did retire recently, but stayed in his job. So, no, I think even the investigation by the Secret Service was inadequate. But that's why we need to have congressional oversight.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you going to request that all, all requests for assets be made in writing and not over the phone, so people can deny that they were ever asked for help?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Yeah, I think they were made in writing as well, and I think some were made by phone, but I think the ones that made by phone were following up on things they made in writing. Somebody was just begging for assets. And think about it, President Trump has had extraordinary rallies, no matter what political perspective you come from, he has extraordinary rallies which have extraordinary risk, much better, much greater risk than having, you know, 200 people in an auditorium where everybody's thoroughly screened and the location is secure. These things really take a lot of detail. But we asked the Secret Service who was in charge of that roof? How could you walk through it three o'clock in the afternoon and see that roof? Nobody walked through. Nobody was in charge. Everybody said, oh, she was in charge of the roof or he was in charge of the roof. No one would actually admit to be in charge of security for Butler.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So there, the big, beautiful bill that the president asked for gives $1.2 billion to the Secret Service. Does money fix that? And what do you say to the family member of the gentleman killed that day? Are we ever going to know the motive of the shooter?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: You know, I think we aren't going to know the motive, and I take that at face value. I know a lot of times when we don't get something and we suspect something, we think government's lying to us. And look, I have my doubts about government on many levels, but I think on this level, they've tried their best and I don't think there's a secret answer that they're not revealing to us. I think they just don't know. What we do know is the failures in security, and that the Corey Comperatore could have possibly been saved by having better security that day. And this boy was seen four hours before the shooting. He was seen again 45 minutes before. Three minutes before the shooting the crowd is chanting, man on a roof, man on a roof. 45 seconds to go as he's assembling his gun. 45 seconds is a long time. Nobody told them to take the president off the stage. Inexcusable, terrible security, but whoever is in charge should have been fired, and really should never be in charge of this type of, or have this type of responsibility again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On the question of forewarning, but on a different topic. This Friday is the deadline for both the Senate and House to vote on a plan to claw back about $9 billion for foreign aid, including also support for NPR and PBS. Some of your fellow Republicans, like Rounds like Murkowski and Collins, have said they are worried about cuts to local radio and public broadcasters in their areas. We looked and in your state of Kentucky, public broadcasters provide critical emergency warnings for the government if there's a storm, for example. Are you concerned that these kind of cuts are going to endanger people?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: You know, I got my start on public television, KET in Kentucky, being a commentator for my taxpayer group that I started. So, you know, I am not an enemy of public TV, but at the same time we have a $2 trillion deficit, and what we'll be presented with is a $9 billion cut in spending. And can we, and should we at least start cutting 9 billion? Yes, if I had my druthers and I could plan it, and I could present the package, I like the idea of across the board cuts of a smaller percentage. So instead of taking 100% of public TV, what you do is you take 6% of everything. But the only way that works is you literally have to take 6% of every dollar, and then you have to figure out how to make it work so it's not absorbed by the poor or the needy in our country. And you could do that. With a penny plan, you can balance your budget within six, within five years, but it takes a real 6% cut of everything. But I think people are more willing to accept a haircut on things they like if everybody is accepting the same sort of level of cut.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you saying there that you are still going to vote for this? Are there 51 Republicans who are going to vote to cut all this funding and pull it back?",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: I suspect it's going to be very close. I don't know if it will be modified in advance, but I can't really honestly look Americans in the face and say that I'm going to be doing something about the deficit if I can't cut 9 billion. Even though there are people who make arguments for it, and I can make an argument for a different way to cut it, we're going to be presented with a $9 billion cut and a $2.2 trillion deficit. So we have to cut spending. Absolutely have to cut spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And a record boost to the debt ceiling that just happened in the bill you did not vote for, but Republicans did. Senator Paul, thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sen. Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Senator Maria Cantwell, who is the top Democrat on the Commerce Committee, which has oversight of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, and the National Weather Service. Good morning, Senator.",
      "SEN. MARIA CANTWELL: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: These agencies are being looked at carefully right now, as you know. Just this morning in Texas, we are seeing the National Weather Service issue another flash flood warning for that very same part of Central Texas, Kerrville. In fact, the ground search for victims had to be halted because of this warning. There's been so much scrutiny of what went wrong or what more could have been done. In your view, at the federal level, is the National Weather Service doing everything it should be doing?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL:\u00a0 You mean at this moment?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Yes, did it function as intended?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, I think what- what's happening here, and we need to take a pause. Glad the president and first lady went, and definitely there's a lot of things being said, but what the real question is, is what can we do to improve the weather forecasting of this nation? To use science, to use better assets, to really do a once in a lifetime investment to upgrade the system so that we could have given people in Kerrville a- more time, more warning and the same for tornadoes and hurricanes and fires. And so I think what we're learning is that in this last week, we've had four events that have all broken huge records for weather and precipitation. That means more flooding. So we know now we're having more extreme weather. What is our response to that to make sure we never have another Kerrville again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So more extreme weather, more stress is on the system. At the same time, you have the Trump administration at least proposing that they're going to do a 27% budget cut to NOAA. The Commerce Secretary, though, said he's not going to touch public for- forecasting. We've seen, though, on the Democratic side, Leader Schumer say there should be an investigation about whether staff cuts, for example, led to or contributed to the Texas disaster. Are Democrats being too quick here to blame the politics?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: You know, I liked your--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're not.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: I liked your opening story about the GAO report and saw what my colleagues presented. You know, I was on that call the day the President was shot and base- shot and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about Butler.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: In Butler. And I basically asked the question on the call that day, did you guys use drones? There was like dead silence. So I'm glad now that GAO, a respected arm of our organization and government, is producing a report. Do you want the same kind of report a year from now? Yes. What we want is to make sure that we understand what happened, but doing blame gaming isn't going to bring people back. But the press has every right to ask hard questions to try to figure out what- what do we need to do to improve weather forecasting, to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I ask that because the DNC and Democratic leaders have said things like this, you're talking in substantial, specific--",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Yes, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --policy language. That's not what's coming from leadership. That's why I'm asking.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, what's important to know is that in this particular storm, what we had is very warm surface conditions in the Gulf. We had- that meant the storm was going to move slower. It meant it was going to drop more precipitation. We as a nation shouldn't be second to Europe or anybody in being a weather-ready nation. We should be the smartest government in the world, using technology, analyzing the data and putting a forecast system into place that gives people that kind of system. So just recently, in- in the Midwest, that work by NOAA and the weather forecasting system and the labs helped give information about how to get out of the way of a tornado two hours in advance, not 15 minutes or 13 minutes, but two hours. And I'm going to send a letter to the President making five recommendations, and some of them are very bipartisan recommendations, things that Senator Cruz or Wicker or Moran support, that basically make this once in a lifetime investment. So we have the best information, the best analysis, the best people to interpret that on the ground for the local responders and let's help Americans get out of the way of a storm.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So on that point, in your recommendations, we are still seeing a proposed budget cut, we are still seeing staff cuts, and the administration is talking about privatizing parts of NOAA.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Yup.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Can you do all of that and then accomplish the outcome you're asking for?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, I think that's what we're going to try to draw attention to. Senator Cruz and I both support upgrading our Doppler radar system. That is having a system that gives you more information about what the storm is likely to do. It's one of the reasons why Europe is a little ahead of us, and you hear about their forecasting system, is because they do more analytics around data that give them higher predictability. I think we're in the same place. Let's get the best system in the country. Senator Wicker and I support these ocean buoys. Those buoys tell you the temperature of the ocean. Why was that so important in this case? Because you needed to know, that temperature tells you how- how much that storm might move or hold in a pattern, and how much precipitation it might move forward and dump in a community. So--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And so believe this has to happen at the federal level? It's not a state-led response in that way, or forecasting rather.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Well, this is- this is a national responsibility. And I think of, you know, if you want your snow shoveled, yeah, you want the mayor to show up, but if you want accurate weather information, it's not community to community. It's a national system, and we share that with the local people and help them best respond. And today, my state has a red flag warning out right on the- in the Seattle Times, telling the whole state very bad conditions today, very hot temperatures, very high winds. That means a fire could be explosive.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So a lot of warning ahead of time. Let's talk more about this on the other side of this break. Stay with us, if you will. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return to our conversation with Senator Maria Cantwell. Just to pick up where we left off in talking about how to, at least, warn people further in advance of potential weather-related disasters. You know, there is still no Senate confirmed head of NOAA. You did go through with a hearing on the committee very recently. And the nominee, Dr. Jacobs, told you that the main mission will still be preserved under this administration. Do you feel comfortable in the potential leadership of Dr. Jacobs? Will you vote to confirm him?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: I haven't decided yet, I have to see. For the record, he did say some very positive things that he wanted a NOAA Organic Act. He wants the Weather Act that Senator Cruz and I have proposed. He said he wanted some other resources there. I gotta drill down on exactly what he thinks is going to happen on the science mission and how we're going to preserve that, because the nation is now spending billions of dollars on storms. In fact, Susan Collins and I had a report from GAO a few- in the last year that showed how much we were spending on the impacts of- of climate and extreme weather. So the point is, it's a minuscule investment to keep some of the science research functions at NOAA to help them better prepare people for hurricanes, for tornadoes and floods. It's a minuscule amount of money. And so we want to be smarter about it, and the more you can move people and resources out of the way of a storm, the more you can predict what might happen, the better prepared we're going to be, and that's going to help us save lives and certainly save dollars. So I want to- I want to get from him exactly how he thinks that this is going to work. But he did say some positive things about the structure. People don't understand, but NOAA is really a science arm of our government to make all of this for the nation and the weather service. So they literally have to fund the hurricane hunters, those are the planes that fly into a hurricane, and we've helped support that in the past in a bipartisan way. It basically funds these- the research that really- I think probably where Europe is right now is they just do better analysis of the data. They're not doing anything extraordinarily better than us. They're probably just spending more time. And if that is a few million dollars and supercomputing time, we should do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Speaking of Europe and the trade conversation the President has renewed just on Saturday, saying he's going to put tariffs on the European Union, and up them on- on Mexico as well, by August 1st. You know, there's been a lot of concern about what it would do to the economy. The stock market seems to be brushing off the impact. Out in your state, Boeing, huge contributor to the U.S. economy, is headquartered there. In fact, they had a 27% increase in airplane deliveries in June. Eight to China, because there's been this sort of cooling off with them. If that's on the back burner, are you less concerned about the trade war?",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Oh no, no, no, no. I'm very concerned we're in an endless summer of trade war, tariffs and chaos. I'm very concerned about this. It is impacting our businesses. We are one of the most trade dependent states in the nation, but it's impacting our ports. I mean literally, trade with our ports is, you know, at least 20% down over last year, the month of May from the previous year. The Association of Washington Businesses is releasing a study that they've previewed with us, and of their membership, 75% of them have said they already are impacted by the tariffs. About--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those are medium sized businesses, or--",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Yes, there are- probably a few would define as large. But they're saying that- 30% of them are saying that they basically have already raised costs in some way, and 15% of them said we've either laid off people or are planning to lay off people in the future. So for us, we are seeing the economic impacts of this and our competitiveness, even though people have planned with storing a lot of material, you know, getting supplies in, trying to prepare for this, this up and down, you know, is really having an effect on costs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it sounds like you're saying at this point, we haven't yet seen fully or felt fully the economic impact. So for the market to be betting that the President is either going to back down or that this isn't as hurtful as some predicted, you're saying just wait and see.",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Oh, I think the market has been very clear. When he says he's going forward with tariffs, they don't like it, and you see a drop and- and- when he takes a pause- But that's not the issue. The issue is small businesses. We have- you know, 75% of jobs are created by small businesses, and those small businesses don't have the same flexibility that a big company does to move out of the way of a supply chain that is now being disrupted. Or, you know, there was a Japanese company, big supplier to U.S. auto manufacturers, that went out of business. So we now have aluminum prices that affects everything from our transportation infrastructure investment to- you know, I heard on Amazon that tea kettles went up, you know, like 40 or 50% in cost. So it's affecting all sorts of products. And, you know, while we may not see all of that at this moment, I guarantee you, as the next quarter results come in, I'm sure we will see some effects of these tariffs. So let's get back to using our alliances to create- you know, why aren't we working with Europe right now to counter, you know, Russia, instead of being in an argument with them on some of these issues that could be resolved in a different form.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will see if an agreement is reached before August the 1st. Senator, thank you very much--",
      "SEN. CANTWELL: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --for joining us today. We'll be right back with more Face the Nation.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on July 13, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation. We have a lot to get to this morning. So, let's begin with Senator Lindsey Graham in Clemson, South Carolina, and Senator Richard Blumenthal in Bridgeport, Connecticut. They both just returned from Europe, where they met with Ukrainian President Zelensky. Good morning to you both, Senators.",
      "SENATOR RICHARD BLUMENTHAL: Good morning.",
      "SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Good Morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, I want to start with you. Russia is escalating. They're not ending this war in Ukraine. NATO's Secretary General is going to be here, in Washington, this week and will be meeting with President Trump, who is, according to our reporting, considering fresh funding for Ukraine. That would be the first time since he's taken office. What do you know about what is coming?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well, I don't want to get ahead of the President, but I'm having dinner, along with Senator Blumenthal and other senators, with Secretary General Mark Rutte, tomorrow night. A turning point regarding Russia's invasion of Ukraine is coming. For months, President Trump has tried to entice Putin to the peace table. He's put tariffs against countries that allow fentanyl to come in our country. Other bad behavior. He's left the door open regarding Russia. That door is about to close. Dick and I have got 85 co-sponsors in the United States Senate for congressional sanctions with a sledgehammer available to President Trump to go after Putin's economy, and all those countries who prop up the Putin war machine. China, India, and Brazil buy oil and petroleum products and other goods from Russia. That's the money Putin uses to prosecute the war. And this congressional package that we're looking at would give President Trump the ability to impose 500% tariffs on any country that helps Russia, and props up Putin's war machine. He can dial it up or down. He can go to 0%, to 500%. He has maximum flexibility. But we're going after the people who keep Putin in business and additional sanctions on Russia itself. This is truly a sledgehammer available to President Trump to end this war.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, on those sanctions, the President said he expects the Senate to pass this measure you put together. And he described being able to terminate it as totally at my option. It, very respectfully, lets the President do whatever he wants, and decide whether or not to exercise it. I know that has raised some concerns among your fellow Democrats, like Senators Kane and Senator Coons. How do you assure them that this is as tough as you promise?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: This has to be a critical moment for these sanctions and bringing down this sledgehammer at this moment was emphasized by all of the European allies who were at the meeting that Senator Graham and I attended in Europe. They are absolutely in solidarity. One after another, in that closed-door setting, expressed the view that the sanctions have to be tough and rigorous to change behavior. And so, the waiver language that we will have in this bill is very much alike the provisions that have existed in past, similar measures that give the President the ability to act in the national security, but also provide congressional oversight. And, I think that kind of assurance to my Democratic colleagues is very important. But, what is most important, I think, at this moment, is our unity. Senator Graham and I, Republican and Democrat, coming together, the European leaders with diverse views, also in unity. And we want to make use of the seized assets, again, in a unified way. I think a multi-faceted approach here is the only way to bring Putin to the table, because he's a thug. He understands only force.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just to follow up on that, the- the seized assets. There's what, $300 billion in Europe. There's about $5 billion here, in the United States. Do you get the sense that the President is going to be willing to tap that, and that the European leaders are going to be willing to seize and use that money?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Part of the plan that I think will be sought in this meeting involving the Secretary General is for Ukraine to be given assets by NATO and their purchasing those military assets from the United States. But the seized property, the seized assets from Russia, can be accessed by the Europeans. They are devising a plan to do it, at least for a part of those assets, billions of dollars, and the interest that is derived from them. Very, very important resources for Ukraine. And the $5 billion that the United States has also could be accessed, and I think it's time to do it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be talking to one of the congressmen who put together that law to be able to seize those assets later in the program. Senator Graham, I want to ask you on the battlefield, and when it comes to weapons. CBS' Jim Laporta has learned a recent defense intelligence assessment shows Ukraine's shortfall in artillery and in drones will lead to marked Russian territorial gains in 2026, with Russia gaining seven to one firepower superiority by this winter. How can you get them what they need if Congress will not approve, in the House, any new funding? Is it what Senator Blumenthal just laid out?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well, just stay tuned for tomorrow's announcement. The idea of America selling weapons to help Ukraine is very much in play. We've given Ukraine a lot. We give them the money, we give them military aid. We now have a minerals agreement with Ukraine that's worth trillions of dollars. So, I don't want to get ahead of the President, but stay tuned about seized assets. The Europeans want to limit the interest on the assets to go to Ukraine. Secretary Bessent wants to go further. Stay tuned about a plan to go after the seized assets more aggressively. Stay tuned for a plan where America will begin to sell to our European allies tremendous amounts of weapons that can benefit Ukraine. Putin has calculated that we would get tired, and Europe would get weary. He made a huge mistake. NATO is bigger and stronger, and we're more committed to ever to make sure he does not take Ukraine by force. So, Congress is on the verge of passing the most consequential sanction package in the history of the- of the country. It will give President Trump tools he doesn't have today, a literal sledgehammer. And the big offenders here is China, India, and Brazil. India buys oil from Russia cheap and resells it. That's despicable. I've talked to President Trump. He said last week, it's time to move. He's tried to entice Putin to the table. But my goal is to end this war, and the only way you're going to end this war is to get people who prop up Putin make them choose between the American economy and helping Putin. And you can only have one negotiator, and that's going to be President Trump, with maximum flexibility to end this war. China, India, and Brazil, you're about to get hurt big time if you keep helping Putin.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Senator, respectfully, the President's rhetoric has changed this week on Russia. He is making clear his patience is very thin. But, he's got, right now, at his fingertips, just short of $4 billion in presidential drawdown authority. He doesn't need to ask Congress. He doesn't need to ask the Europeans for that money. He's got it if he wants to tap it. Wouldn't it be a stronger sign if he just sent those weapons or surged them?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Well, the $4 billion and not nearly enough. I expect him to exercise that draw-down authority. But the game, regarding Putin's invasion of Russia, is about to change. I expect, in the coming days, you will see weapons flowing at a record level to help Ukraine defend themselves. I expect, in the coming days, that there will be tariffs and sanctions available to President Trump he has never had before. I expect, in the coming days, more support from Europe regarding the efforts to help Ukraine. Putin made a miscalculation here. For six months, President Trump tried to entice Putin to the table. The attacks have gone up, not down. One of the biggest miscalculations Putin has made is to play Trump. And you just watch, in the coming days and weeks, there's going to be a massive effort to get Putin to the table. And to those who are helping him, China, buying cheap Russian oil and having no accountability, those days are about over.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Blumenthal, on- on Ukraine, North Korea has been sending troops, as you know, to fight for Russia in Ukraine. Russia's top diplomat was just meeting with Kim Jong Un. We know that the missile technology Russia is providing them is, sort of, their payment for sending bodies to fight. Is that going to make a measurable difference in the North Korean nuclear program? Is there more of a threat today to the US because of it?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: The threat of cooperation on that score in sending missile technology to North Korea, as well as support for Iran, that potentially could come from Russia, is a major piece of evidence why we need to be strong with our allies against this axis. It still exists. The success against Iran's nuclear program ought not to make us complacent about the dangers of proliferating nuclear arms. And, absolutely, yes, we should be coming down stronger, not only on Russia but North Korea, and our plan has to be to deter this kind of nuclear arms cooperation, which is why our working with our allies is so important. As they went around the room, these are the major European leaders, all of them, assembled together last Thursday in Rome, thanking us for being there, Senator Graham and myself, and General Kellogg, representing Trump. This moment of unity must be seized, and the timing is absolutely critical. President Zelensky has been robust and stalwart, but his people are being killed by bombs and drones. Children kidnapped. We need to, really, express the strength of the United States, because only strength can get Putin to the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, on another topic here, you have been an advocate for the allies of the United States who were left behind in Afghanistan following that chaotic 2021 withdrawal by the last administration. On Friday, the State Department laid off the personnel in the department that helps place those refugees and other allies in the United States. Two sources with direct knowledge told CBS that there are about 1,400 Afghan allies with connections to the Pentagon, with connections to US intelligence, and they're stuck there. They don't know what's happening next. Can you stop them from being sent back to the Taliban?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, I don't think there's any desire by anybody to send people who helped us in Afghanistan back to the Taliban control. That's not going to happen. As to trimming up the State Department, if you're telling me we can't reduce the number of people working in the State Department and still run it effectively, I don't buy that. We can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are some questions about who's going to actually help prevent them from going back to Afghanistan, which is why I was asking you that if you're going to advocate on their behalf. Senator Blumenthal, you sit on the Judiciary Committee, I believe. CBS has reported yesterday that the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, fired 20 DOJ employees who worked on the classified documents cases and the January 6 investigations. There are more firings expected. These are career officers and lawyers who don't pick their assignments. They're handed out to them. Is there anything that Congress can do to protect some of these civil servants?",
      "SEN. BLUMENTHAL: Margaret, that's a really important question, because Pam Bondi has so politicized, and weaponized the Department of Justice and now firing these career professionals who have devoted their lives to the Department of Justice, it's only one facet of the continuing politicization. And, yes, Congress ought to be investigating. The Judiciary Committee ought to begin, right away, its inquiry. But, I'm calling for an Inspector General investigation, not only of these firings, but also of the dropping of a prosecution into the Utah physician who was mid-trial on charges of conspiracy, fraud against the government, in connection with a COVID vaccine scheme, apparently, at the behest of politicians who were deeply angry about the MAGA issue there. And, I believe strongly that now Congress must investigate",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, do you want to quickly respond to those allegations of politicized handling up at the Justice Department?",
      "SEN. GRAHAM: Yeah, y'all missed a lot. The Justice Department was used to destroy President Trump, his family, and tried to change the election by bringing a bunch of B-S charges against him for years. We're going to clean that mess up. As to Pam Bondi, I have all the confidence in the world she will do her job. And if somebody has been terminated, they have rights under civil service law to say it was wrongfully done. But, I'm almost amused at the idea that people are now suddenly worried about politicization of the Justice Department, while everybody sat quiet for all those years. Literally, the Justice Department, under Biden, tried to change the election by prosecuting Trump based on a bunch of B-S.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there are mass firings, which is why I was asking you about them, sir. Senators, thank you for joining us for a bipartisan interview, up until that last section. Appreciate it. Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",

      "A funeral was held Sunday for a Palestinian-American and his friend who were killed in the Israel-occupied West Bank.",
      "Saifullah Kamel Musallet, 20, a Tampa, Florida native, was killed in a confrontation with settlers while protecting his family's land in the town of Singjil, north of Ramallah, according to his family and the Palestinian Health Ministry. His family told CBS News he was meant to be headed back to Florida this week after visiting family.",
      "Musallet's friend, Mohammed al-Shalabi, was shot in the chest, according to the health ministry.",
      "On Sunday, their bodies were carried through the streets of Al-Mazraa a- Sharqiya, a town south of where they were killed. Mourners, waving Palestinian flags, chanted \"God is great.\"",
      "\"He worked at his family's ice cream shop in Tampa and was loved by so many people there. He was always kind and compassionate,\" Musallet's cousin Fatmah Muhammad, who is a business owner in Southern California, told CBS News on Saturday.",
      "The U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed Saturday to CBS News that a U.S. citizen died in the West Bank on Friday but referred questions about any investigation into the incident to Israel's government. Musallet's family, meanwhile, said it wants the U.S. to investigate.",

      "Violence in the West Bank\u00a0is on the rise, with Israeli settlers expanding their efforts to occupy land in the contested region. Palestinians and rights groups have long accused the military of ignoring settler violence.",

      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in Washington last week to discuss the deal with the Trump administration but a new sticking point has emerged over the deployment of Israeli troops during the truce, raising questions over the feasibility of a new deal, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Israel wants to keep forces in what it says is an important land corridor in southern Gaza. Hamas views the insistence on troops in that strip of land as an indication that Israel intends to continue the war once a temporary ceasefire expires.",
      "In a statement Sunday, Netanyahu's office slammed Hamas for refusing to accept the framework of the most recent proposal, saying the terrorist group is \"making unreasonable demands.\"",
      "Israel says it will only end the war once Hamas surrenders, disarms and goes into exile, something it refuses to do. Hamas says it is willing to free all the remaining 50 hostages, less than half said to be alive, in exchange for an end to the war and the full withdrawal of Israeli forces.",
      "The 21-month war was sparked when Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and abducting 251. Many of those hostages have since either been released or their bodies have been recovered in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",

      "Anisimova, who was born in New Jersey and grew up in Florida, was a semifinalist at age 17 at the 2019 French Open.",
      "A year ago, she tried to qualify for Wimbledon because her ranking of 189th was too low to get into the field automatically, but she lost in the preliminary event. She ousted the world's No. 1 female tennis player, Aryna Sabalenka, on Thursday in the Wimbledon semi-finals \u2014 shocking the sports world.",
      "Anisimova returned to the tennis circuit about 12 months ago, and when asked about her journey after beating Sabalenka, she said, \"To be honest, if you told me I would be in the finals at Wimbledon, I would not believe you.\"",

      "Backstreet Boys singer Brian Littrell has filed a lawsuit against a Florida county, accusing the sheriff\u2019s department of refusing to keep trespassers off of his private beach.",
      "Littrell said that to protect the \"peaceful enjoyment\" of his property in Walton County, Florida, on the Gulf Coast, his limited liability company, BLB Beach Hut LLC, has put up \"no trespassing\" signs as well as tables, chairs and umbrellas showing where the property line starts on the beach, according to the lawsuit obtained by Fox News Digital and filed in a Florida court recently.",
      "He wrote that the efforts have been \"in vain, as numerous trespassers have set out to antagonize, bully and harass the Littrell family by regularly, every day, trespassing on BLB\u2019s beach, on the Subject Property, in open defiance of the law.\"",

      "Littrell wrote in the lawsuit that he has been forced to hire security to protect his land and family, and filled out a Walton County Trespass Authorization Form, authorizing the sheriff\u2019s department to warn and prosecute trespassers on his property.",
      "\"Despite BLB\u2019s numerous requests and the execution of the required forms, the sheriff has refused to come to the Subject Property to enforce the law and remove the trespassers, to charge the trespassers, or to take any action, at all, thereby refusing to do their duty,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The lawsuit says that on May 4, a sheriff\u2019s deputy spoke to an alleged trespasser on Littrell\u2019s property, but didn\u2019t remove the trespasser or cite them, merely saying that the alleged trespasser \"'doesn\u2019t agree with private beaches,\u2019 going on to characterize BLB\u2019s insistence that it\u2019s constitutional rights be upheld as \u2018lunacy,\u2019 to use one of the words used by a deputy of the Sheriff\u2019s Department.\"",
      "The lawsuit also claims that on June 5, an alleged trespasser grabbed legal documents related to the dispute out of the property manager\u2019s hand \"and scattered the papers into the wind across the beach.\"",
      "Littrel said BLB also contacted the sheriff\u2019s department twice that day regarding the \"aggressor,\" but the department \"refused to send any officer.\"",
      "\"When BLB personnel contacted the Sheriff for the third time to request an officer again, the 911 operator simply hung up on BLB personnel rather than dispatching the officer that was requested more than an hour prior,\" the lawsuit states.",

      "\"Vitriol\" against BLB \"has recently escalated,\" the lawsuit says, claiming that a trespasser damaged a table on his property \"after being warned by a BLB employee.\"",
      "Littrell claimed that a deputy had come to the property, but hadn\u2019t taken any action against the alleged trespasser, and \"body camera footage shows multiple instances of disrespect against BLB\u2019s agents by the responding officer.\"",

These people, the ones who insist on trespassing in what is actually our backyard, who started this fight have to pass several scarcely populated public beach areas to get to our property.\"",
      "Littrell claimed that the alleged trespassers are \"people who believe that anyone who has succeeded and managed to live the American Dream must be bad people. They want it so no one owns anything, and everyone is happy, except it never works out that way.\"",
      "He added, \"The really scary thing is we have provided to law enforcement all the things they asked of all the private beach homeowners to enforce the law and they will not bother to do their duty to protect the homeowners.

      "Celebrity status became an advantage for these public figures when entering the courtroom and facing a jury of their peers, experts told Fox News Digital.",
      "After seven weeks of trial, Diddy was found not guilty of sex trafficking \u2013 one of the most serious accusations the rapper had been facing. Spacey was acquitted in his high-profile London trial stemming from allegations that he had assaulted four men, while Depp won $10 million in his defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard.",

      "\"Initially, it provided exposure, disinfectant, and justice for decades of criminal behavior in Hollywood. However, the tidal wave of claims \u2013 many of which turned out to either be false, or simply lacking evidentiary support \u2013 caused an over-correction across the legal system that was akin to jerking the steering wheel the moment your tires begin to slip on ice. It gradually became emotion over evidence, and that is antithetical to jurisprudential standards in America.\"",
      "\"The court of public opinion is an angry mob; a court of law is a jury of your peers. The latter requires evidence, a burden of proof, and a presumption of innocence, while the former often conflates an accusation with a conviction. In the height of the #MeToo era, these were all lacking and over a long enough timeline, Americans \u2013 men and women alike \u2013 begun to realize and eventually rebel against this.\"",

      "\"The novelty of the #MeToo movement and fear of guilt through mere accusation is over,\" he said. \"The public is now as sensitive to abusive extortion tactics by incredible opportunists as it is to legitimate claims by real victims.

And prosecutors like going after celebrities to make a name for themselves, cash out and leave the District Attorney and U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for a high-paying gig. The same applies to civil plaintiff\u2019s lawyers. They prefer suing celebrities to regular people because of the publicity and the fact that they have lots of money and can pay a judgment. And with that celebrity money comes the ability to pay the best and brightest lawyers in the game.\"",
      "\"Celebrity cases are tough to win, because you have a well-liked defendant who may be the target of an aggressive prosecutor or civil plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, and who has unlimited funds to assemble a dream team. Lawyers think they can steamroll them like their other defendants, but they can\u2019t because of the difference in resources and the innate advantages celebrities have. Trials often come down to liability and credibility, and celebrities have the upper hand, because jurors love them. That is why they are tough to take down inside a courtroom.\"",

      "\"Hypnosis is the oldest Western form of psychotherapy, but it is underutilized,\" Dr. David Spiegel, associate chair of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine in California and a leading authority in the field of hypnosis, told Fox News Digital.",

      "What is hypnosis?",

      "Lung cancer, the second-most common cancer in the U.S., is often associated with smoking \u2014 but even those who have never had a cigarette could be at risk of the deadly disease.",
      "While it\u2019s true that those who smoke face a much higher risk, up to 20% of lung cancers affect people who have never smoked or have smoked fewer than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",
      "Despite this, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) does not recommend lung cancer screening for those who have never smoked, as the agency states the risks may outweigh the potential benefits.",
      "DISPOSABLE VAPES MORE TOXIC AND CARCINOGENIC THAN CIGARETTES, STUDY SHOWS",
      "Most lung cancers fall into two groups: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), according to the American Cancer Society.",
      "NSCLC, which encompasses about 80% to 85% of all lung cancers, includes adenocarcinoma (common in non-smokers), squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma.",

      "The remaining lung cancers are classified as SCLC, a more aggressive type that tends to spread faster and has a poorer prognosis.",
      "Mohamed Abazeed, M.D., Ph.D., chair of radiation oncology and the William N. Brand Professor at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, agrees that the share of lung cancers diagnosed in never-smokers is increasing, particularly among women and patients of Asian ancestry.",
      "CANCER DEATH RATES DECLINE YET NEW DIAGNOSES SPIKE FOR SOME GROUPS, SAYS REPORT",
      "\"While overall incidence is declining due to reduced smoking rates, the relative share of never-smokers is growing and is reflected in clinical practice, where we increasingly diagnose patients without a traditional smoking history,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "Dr. Lauren Nicola, a practicing radiologist and chief medical officer at Reveal Dx in North Carolina, said she is also seeing an increase in the rate of newly diagnosed lung cancer in non-smokers, particularly among women and younger adults.",
      "Most lung cancers fall into two groups: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), according to the American Cancer Society. (iStock)",
      "The main factor driving up the share of non-smokers among lung cancer patients, according to Abazeed, is the successful drive to reduce tobacco consumption in the U.S.",
      "\"Other factors include improvements in imaging and broader use of CT scans that have enhanced early-stage tumor detection,\" he noted.",
      "\"It is estimated that about 8% of lung cancers are inherited or occur because of a genetic predisposition.\"",
      "\"Evolving environmental factors may also be contributing to this change, with pollutants potentially driving lung inflammation, which in turn has been implicated in cancer development.\"",
      "Modifiable risk factors",
      "Some of the biggest non-smoking risk factors for lung cancer include ambient air pollution and secondhand smoke, according to Abazeed.",
      "Exposure to thoracic radiation (high-energy radiation in the chest area) \u2014 along with occupational hazards like radon, asbestos and diesel exhaust \u2014 can also increase the risk.",
      "The main factor driving up the share of non-smokers among lung cancer patients is the successful drive to reduce tobacco consumption in the U.S., experts say. (iStock)",
      "Lifestyle-related inflammation, which is often linked to poor diet and sedentary behavior, can also play a role, Nicola noted.",
      "\"Some of these, like radon and air quality, can be addressed at the household or policy level,\" Abazeed said.",
      "RISKS, SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENTS FOR LUNG CANCER, THE DEADLIEST CANCER IN THE WORLD",
      "\"Lifestyle interventions \u2014 such as exercise, diet and avoidance of indoor pollutants \u2014 may play a modest protective role.\"",
      "Both doctors pointed out that former smokers, especially those who smoked more often and for longer periods of time, remain at elevated risk even decades after quitting.",
      "\"The greater the number of pack-years, the higher the risk,\" said Nicola. \"Risk declines over time after quitting, but never returns to the baseline of a never-smoker.\"",
      "Genetic risk factors",
      "Some people inherit a higher risk of developing lung cancer due to their DNA.",

      "\"Inherited predisposition is an area of active investigation, particularly in younger patients or those with a strong family history.\"",
      "Having a first-degree relative with lung cancer roughly doubles the risk of developing the disease, even after controlling for smoking exposure, according to Nicola.",
      "\"Up to 50% of all chest CTs will detect at least one pulmonary nodule.\"",
      "\"Cancers in non-smokers are more often associated with specific genetic mutations and genomic profiles,\" she said. \"This suggests that these malignancies have a different underlying biology compared to tumors in smokers.\"",
      "Screenings in question",
      "Current U.S. screening guidelines call for annual low-dose CT scans for high-risk individuals based on age and smoking history, Abazeed reiterated.",

      "\"There is a growing interest in expanding eligibility to include non-smoking risk factors,\" Abazeed noted. \"Evidence is accumulating that could potentially change current population-wide guidelines.\"",

      "Exposure to occupational hazards like radon, asbestos and diesel exhaust can increase lung cancer risk. (Photo by Gado/Getty Images)",
      "\"The problem with screening everyone for lung cancer is that up to 50% of all chest CTs will detect at least one pulmonary nodule,\" Nicola noted. \"The vast majority of these nodules are benign, but a small percentage will turn out to be cancer.\"",

      "Using millimeter wave (mmWave) imaging, the same type of signal used in Wi-Fi, the researchers developed a system called mmNorm. There\u2019s nothing normal about this superpower.

      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "How robots detect damage inside boxes using mmWave imaging",
      "Millimeter waves are particularly effective at penetrating materials such as cardboard, plastic and even interior walls. When these waves hit an object inside a box, they reflect. The mmNorm system captures these reflections and feeds them into an algorithm that estimates the shape and direction of the surface of the hidden item.",
      "Unlike traditional radar systems, mmNorm accounts for a challenging property called specularity, which refers to the way radio waves bounce off shiny or angled surfaces, much like a mirror. By estimating the surface normal (the direction a surface is facing), the system's accuracy improves dramatically. The method combines reflections from multiple antennas that \"vote\" on the surface normal direction based on signal strength, improving the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The technology powering robots that detect damage inside boxes",
      "What makes mmNorm different is its clever use of physics. Instead of ignoring reflections that bounce away from the radar (as most systems do), it captures them to infer the shape and orientation of hidden surfaces. Lead author Laura Dodds explained that the system doesn't just track where a signal comes from. It also analyzes the direction the surface is facing. To do this, the MIT team used a robotic arm equipped with a radar unit. As it moved around a sealed box, it gathered multiple measurements, building a detailed 3D picture of what was inside.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",
      "Why robots that detect damage inside boxes are a game-changer for warehouses",
      "During testing, mmNorm achieved 96% accuracy in reconstructing complex items, such as power drills and silverware. That's a big jump compared to the 78% accuracy offered by similar systems. In a warehouse setting, this means robotic arms could inspect the contents of packages moving down a conveyor belt without unpacking them.",
      "It also opens the door for humanoid robots to roam warehouses and assess packages for damage or missing parts in real time. However, the technology does not work well for objects hidden behind metal or very thick walls, which limits some applications.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Where else could robots detect damage inside boxes and make an impact",
      "Beyond warehouse automation, this technology opens the door to several other promising uses. In factory production lines, robots that detect damage inside boxes could inspect goods quickly and without opening packages, helping maintain high-quality standards.",
      "In assisted-living centers, the same approach might help ensure safety by checking the contents of containers without disturbing residents. Even in security screening, being able to see through sealed boxes could enhance threat detection without adding any strain on bandwidth since the system uses the same mmWave signals as existing technologies. The research team plans to further improve the resolution of mmNorm and boost its performance on less reflective objects, making it even more versatile for future applications.",
      "A robotic arm scans a sealed box using mmWave radar to detect objects inside\u00a0 (MIT)",

      "We may be entering an era where robots don't just move boxes, but they understand what's in them.

      "A woman on the phone with customer service\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How chatbots are changing customer service for businesses",
      "A chatbot is an artificial intelligence tool designed to simulate real-time conversations with users. It operates around the clock, doesn't require breaks and can manage a high volume of requests simultaneously. For businesses, that sounds like an ideal solution. It's no surprise that the chatbot market has surged from $370 million in 2017 to $2.2 billion in 2024. Many companies now rely on chatbots as the first point of contact for customer service. Despite the convenience, not all customers are on board.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Why most customers still prefer human agents over chatbots",
      "While companies are excited about the speed and efficiency of chatbots, many customers are not. A recent survey found that 71% of people would rather speak with a human agent. Even more concerning, 60% said chatbots often do not understand their issue. This is not just about getting the wrong answer. It comes down to trust. Most people are still unsure about artificial intelligence, especially when their time or money is on the line.",
      "Customer service representatives (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS CHATGPT?",
      "When customers want a human agent instead of a chatbot",
      "Not every customer question is the same. Some are simple and quick. Others are more complex or personal. And that's where chatbots fall short. A recent survey showed that 47% of people were OK with a company using their purchase history for marketing. But only 9% were OK with the company using their financial information. That's a big difference. When things feel more sensitive or serious, people want a real person to help.",
      "New research compares chatbots to human agents in customer service",
      "To better understand how people really interact with chatbots and human agents, researcher Vivek Astvansh partnered with a large North American retailer and analyzed more than 500,000 customer service chats. The findings are detailed in his peer-reviewed study, \"Insights from Customers' Chats with Bots and Human Agents.\"",
      "The study found that most inquiries fell into one of six categories: orders, coupons, products, shipping, account issues and payments. When customers had questions about detailed or sensitive topics, such as shipping or payment issues, they were far more likely to seek out a human agent rather than rely on a chatbot. Astvansh's research also revealed that human agents were more effective at matching the content and communication style of the customer than chatbots.",
      "This similarity in language and topic focus led to stronger rapport between customer and agent. In fact, the closer the agent's responses aligned with the dominant topic of the conversation, the faster and more frequently customers replied. The data suggests that customers feel more engaged when they sense they are being understood, which is a key driver of satisfaction during service interactions.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "How businesses can improve customer service with a hybrid approach",
      "So, how can businesses use these insights to improve customer service? Not every customer issue should be handled by a chatbot. Companies should determine the intent behind each inquiry before deciding whether it should be routed to a bot or a human.",
      "Human agents already know how to mirror a customer's tone and focus. For chatbots to succeed, they must be trained to recognize and adapt to customer intent and language patterns. While this doesn't come naturally to machines, it can be programmed using machine-learning models like those used in the study.",
      "If a company is investing in a chatbot system, it should track how well that system performs. Businesses should ask chatbot vendors to provide real-world data showing how their bots compare to human agents in terms of efficiency, accuracy and customer satisfaction. If the technology cannot meet a high standard, it may not be worth the investment.",

      "AI tools, such as chatbots, are helpful and are not going away anytime soon. But customers still want to feel heard and understood. That usually means talking to a real person.

      "Farmers everywhere are facing a tough reality. There simply aren't enough people willing to do the backbreaking work of weeding fields, and the weeds themselves are getting harder to kill with chemicals. Many farmers would rather avoid using herbicides, but until now, they haven't had a practical alternative. Kenny Lee, CEO of Aigen, puts it plainly: farmers don't love chemicals, but they use them because it's often the only tool available. Aigen's mission is to give them a better choice.",

      "What are swappable EV batteries?",
      "Swappable EV batteries are modular battery packs that can be quickly exchanged instead of recharged. CATL, a global leader in battery technology, created a system called Choco-SEB that allows drivers to replace a drained battery in about 100 seconds. This makes battery swapping a realistic alternative to traditional EV charging.",
      "Swappable EV battery on screen at launch event\u00a0 (CATL)",
      "How CATL's Choco-SEB battery system works",
      "CATL's Choco-SEB battery system is focused on speed and flexibility. It is designed to support a wide range of electric vehicles, from compact city cars to larger sedans. The system lets drivers swap batteries quickly and choose the setup that matches their needs best. With this technology, a single battery swap can deliver up to 373 miles of range, depending on the vehicle.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "CATL's goal is to make electric vehicle ownership easier and more appealing. Swappable EV batteries give drivers the flexibility to power up without plugging in. With more stations on the way and compatibility across a wide range of cars, this system could redefine what it means to drive electric. While this technology isn't coming to the U.S. just yet, American EV manufacturers may want to take note, as swappable battery tech could be the game-changer drivers have been waiting for.",

      "Windows PC\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the Secure Boot vulnerability in Windows 11?",
      "The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-3052, was discovered by firmware security firm Binarly. They found that a legitimate BIOS update tool signed by Microsoft could be abused to tamper with the Windows boot process. Once exploited, the flaw allows attackers to shut off Secure Boot entirely. In the wrong hands, this vulnerability could lead to a new generation of malware. These threats could bypass even the most advanced antivirus or detection software.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers can abuse Microsoft-signed tools to shut down Secure Boot",
      "At the center of the issue is a BIOS-flashing utility built for rugged tablets. Microsoft signed it using its UEFI CA 2011 certificate. Because that certificate is trusted on nearly every Secure Boot-enabled system, the tool can run without raising alarms. The danger lies in how the tool handles a specific NVRAM variable. Binarly's researchers found that it reads this variable blindly, without checking what's inside. That small oversight opens the door to a serious exploit.",
      "In a demonstration, Binarly used a proof-of-concept attack to change this variable's value. By setting it to zero, they were able to overwrite a global setting critical to enforcing Secure Boot. That action completely disabled Secure Boot protections. Once that happens, unsigned UEFI modules can run freely. Attackers can then install stealthy, low-level malware known as bootkits, malware that operates below the Windows operating system itself. For hackers, this method offers the ultimate persistence.",
      "Windows laptop\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Microsoft released a fix-but you must act to stay protected",
      "Binarly reported the flaw to CERT/CC in February 2025. At first, it appeared to affect only a single module. But Microsoft's deeper investigation uncovered a bigger problem. The same vulnerability affected 14 modules signed with the same trusted certificate. Microsoft responded in June 2025 by revoking the cryptographic hashes of all 14 affected modules. These hashes were added to the Secure Boot revocation list, known as the dbx. This prevents the modules from running during startup. However, this protection is not automatic. Unless users or organizations manually apply the updated dbx, their systems remain vulnerable, even with other patches installed.",

      "Six essential tips to protect your Windows 11 PC from hackers",
      "Protecting your PC doesn't have to be complicated. Just follow these simple steps to keep hackers at bay and your information safe.",
      "1. Keep your computer updated:\u00a0Software updates aren\u2019t just about new features. They fix serious security issues. In this case, Microsoft has already released a fix for the Secure Boot vulnerability, but it only works if your system is fully updated. Just head to your settings, open Windows Update, and make sure everything is installed. A lot of people delay updates for weeks, but these patches are the first line of defense against threats like this.",
      "2. Don\u2019t install tools you don\u2019t fully understand:\u00a0It might be tempting to download apps that claim to speed up your computer or fix problems, especially ones recommended in YouTube videos or tech forums. But that\u2019s exactly how a lot of threats sneak in. This particular vulnerability came from a legitimate-looking tool that was misused. So, if you\u2019re not sure what something does or if it asks for permission to change how your system boots up, skip it. Or ask someone who knows more, before you click anything.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and leave it running:\u00a0Even though this new threat targets something deep inside the system, having strong antivirus protection still helps catch related malware. If you're on Windows, Defender is already built in and does a decent job. But if you don\u2019t want to rely on Windows\u2019 built-in tools, use a third-party antivirus.",

      "4. Restart your computer every now and then:\u00a0This one sounds basic, but it matters. A lot of updates don\u2019t fully apply until after a restart. If you keep putting your computer to sleep or hibernating it for days at a time, your system might still be stuck in an unsafe state. Try to restart it at least every couple of days, or whenever an update asks for it.",
      "5. Don\u2019t ignore warnings from Windows or your antivirus:\u00a0If something pops up telling you a file looks dangerous or that an update is needed, pay attention. It\u2019s easy to get into the habit of closing these messages without reading them, but that\u2019s how problems get missed. If a warning looks confusing or too technical, take a screenshot or a photo, and ask someone for help. The important thing is not to ignore it and move on.",
      "6. Remove your personal data from people-search sites:\u00a0Even if hackers don't directly target you through the Secure Boot flaw, many cyberattacks begin by gathering personal information that's easily found online. This can include your full name, address, phone number and even the names of your relatives. Data broker websites collect and publish this information without your consent, putting you at greater risk. Using a personal data removal service helps you reduce your online exposure and make it harder for bad actors to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University have made significant progress with noninvasive brain technology. They use electroencephalography (EEG) to detect the brain's electrical activity when someone thinks about moving a finger. Artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning algorithms, then decodes these signals and translates them into commands for a robotic hand. In their study, participants managed to move two or even three robotic fingers at once, just by imagining the motion. The system achieved over 80% accuracy for two-finger tasks. For three-finger tasks, accuracy was over 60%. All of this happened in real time.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Meeting the challenge of finger-level control",
      "Achieving separate movement for each robotic finger is a real challenge. The brain areas responsible for finger movement are small. Their signals often overlap, which makes it hard to distinguish between them. However, advances in noninvasive brain technology and deep learning have made it possible to pick up on these subtle differences.",

It can generate strong, random passwords, store them in an encrypted vault, and sync across your devices so you always have access. Using NordPass along with multi-factor authentication is one of the best strategies to keep your accounts and personal data safe from hackers.",

      "How does latest technology work?",
      "Our bodies change as we get older, and one undesirable result is that we become more vulnerable to age-related issues. Particularly, old age is characterized by a significant physical and mental decline. But why is it that some people thrive in their later years, while others face several health challenges prematurely? It's as if some people age faster than others.",
      "To get to the bottom of this, scientists from Duke, Harvard, and the University of Otago have unveiled a game-changing tool called DunedinPACNI.

      "A doctor\u2019s hand pointing at a brain scan. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The secret to how fast we age is in the brain",
      "The DunedinPACNI was named after the Dunedin Study, which followed over 1,000 people since their birth in the 1970s. Researchers analyzed decades of data, looking at factors like blood pressure, BMI, cholesterol, glucose, kidney function, and even dental health, to come up with a unique \"aging score\" for each participant. The new MRI-based AI brain scan can predict this score with surprising accuracy from a scan taken at age 45.",
      "Brain aging predicts both physical and mental decline",
      "Participants whose aging scores were faster showed early signs of memory-related brain changes, such as shrinkage of the hippocampus. Follow-up studies of people aged between 52 and 89 showed that those aging rapidly were 60% more likely to develop dementia, 18% more likely to be diagnosed with chronic illnesses, and 40% more likely to die within the same period compared to those who were aging at a slower pace. This data shows that brain aging and overall physical decline are closely linked.",

      "DunedinPACNI is the future of preventative healthcare",
      "The team believes DunedinPACNI could change the landscape of preventive medicine. If it were possible to spot health risks early through an AI brain scan, at-risk individuals might be motivated to make healthier lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, and stress management). It could also help healthcare providers evaluate the effectiveness of treatment and slow the progression of age-related diseases.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "The DunedinPACNI is a great tool that offers a non-invasive and powerful window into biological aging that traditional blood tests never could. A single AI brain scan provides a lifetime of health insights. It comes at a much-needed time as chronic diseases are on the rise.

      "A disturbing wave of fake agent phone scams is sweeping across the United States, catching people off guard and draining their savings. These criminals do not just pretend to be someone you trust; they impersonate federal agents, threaten arrest, and demand payment on the spot. As the schemes become more sophisticated, the FBI and other law enforcement agencies are issuing urgent warnings. Moreover, the scams are spreading rapidly and becoming increasingly difficult to spot.",

      "A woman receiving a fake scam phone call. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake agent phone scams trick victims into sending money",
      "Often, it begins with a phone call that appears legitimate. The number might display familiar initials, such as \"FBI,\" \"US Marshals,\" or even your local police department. Scammers use spoofing technology to fake caller IDs, making the call look official. During the call, the scammer creates panic with claims like:",

      "Your Social Security number has been frozen.",
      "A loved one is in jail and needs money for GPS monitoring.",
      "You missed a jury duty summons and now face arrest.",
      "To avoid immediate legal trouble, victims are often instructed to pay immediately, usually through prepaid gift cards, cryptocurrency ATMs, or wire transfers. These demands are designed to be untraceable and irreversible. Importantly, the US Marshals will NEVER call you to collect money, the agency emphasized in a public warning.",
      "Fake agent phone scams are targeting victims across the United States",
      "Reports of these calls have come in from New York, Illinois, Virginia, and nearly every other state. Some victims have lost thousands of dollars. In Michigan, scammers increased their credibility by using the real names and ranks of local officers. Meanwhile, in Maryland, suspects posing as FTC agents even showed up in person twice to collect cash. This scam is not limited to phone calls. Text messages, known as \"smishing\" attacks, are also on the rise. One version targeted iPhone users with fake DMV payment demands. According to cybersecurity firm Guardio, smishing surged 773% in just one month.",
      "Why fake agent phone scams succeed and how they manipulate trust",
      "Fraudsters know how to exploit fear effectively. They count on the fact that most people will do almost anything to avoid arrest or protect a family member. By spoofing official numbers, they undermine our first line of defense: trust. However, it is not just about technology. Experts also warn of an emotional manipulation crisis. These scammers don't just steal your money, they steal your identity too. As a result, victims feel violated, scared, and uncertain about whom to trust.",

      "If someone calls claiming to be from a government agency and demands money, don't explain or ask questions; just hang up. Real law enforcement will never ask for payment over the phone, and they won't threaten you into silence.",
      "No legitimate government agency will ever ask you to settle a legal issue with a prepaid gift card or a trip to a Bitcoin ATM. These are hallmark signs of a scam, designed to move your money fast and leave no trace.",
      "The number on your screen might look official, but spoofing technology can fake any number, even 911 or the FBI. If the caller creates pressure or fear, hang up and verify using an official number from the agency's website.",
      "Even if you don't fall for the scam, reporting it can help authorities track these operations. Contact your local FBI field office, your state's Attorney General, or file a report at reportfraud.ftc.gov. Every report helps build a stronger case.",
      "Scammers often target people who are more likely to believe a false threat, especially seniors or non-native English speakers. Have a conversation with family and friends so they know what to look out for and what to do if they receive a suspicious call or message.",
      "Many scammers do their homework before making contact. They might already know your name, address, or even a relative's name to sound more convincing. Using a reputable personal data removal service can reduce the chances of your private information being misused. The less data available online, the fewer hooks criminals have to grab onto.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Some scams are shifting from voice calls to text messages. If you receive a message claiming to be from the DMV, IRS, or law enforcement, don't click any links. These texts (known as \"smishing\" attacks) can trick you into entering personal info or downloading malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "These criminals are getting smarter, but so can we. Staying informed and understanding what real law enforcement will never do is key to protecting yourself and your family. Authorities will not threaten you over the phone, demand gift cards or cryptocurrency, or ask you to prove your innocence with money. If something feels off, trust your gut.

      "Illustration of Emojis on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Scientific evidence: Emojis boost closeness and responsiveness",
      "A recent study led by Eun Huh at The University of Texas at Austin put this idea to the test. Researchers asked 260 adults to read text conversations that were identical except for one thing: the presence of emojis. Participants then rated how responsive and engaged their conversation partner appeared to be.",
      "The results? Messages with emojis made people feel their partners were more attentive and emotionally engaged. This perceived responsiveness led to greater feelings of closeness, higher relationship satisfaction, and even increased likability. And it didn't matter whether the emoji was a smiley face or a simple object; what mattered was that it matched the tone of the message.",
      "Example of a text exchange using emojis on an iPhone. (Eun Huh)",
      "Why emojis strengthen relationships in digital communication",
      "Emojis act as digital body language. In face-to-face conversations, we rely on tone, facial expressions, and gestures to show we care. In texts, emojis fill that gap by adding emotional nuance and clarity. They can make your intentions clear, reduce misunderstandings, and help your messages feel more personal and warm.",

      "Do all emojis equally enhance relationship closeness?",
      "Interestingly, the type of emoji, whether a smiling face or a random object, didn't make a difference in how responsive the sender seemed. What matters most is that the emoji is emotionally consistent with your message. So, don't stress over picking the \"perfect\" emoji; just make sure it fits the mood of your text.",

      "Steam rises from cooling towers at a nuclear facility. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How nuclear fusion works and why it matters for clean energy",
      "Fusion is the same process that powers the sun. Instead of splitting atoms like traditional nuclear power, fusion forces hydrogen atoms to fuse together at extremely high temperatures. This reaction releases enormous amounts of energy. It does not produce greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste.",

      "Google\u2019s new partnership with CFS is the largest fusion energy deal ever signed. The company will purchase 200 MW of clean power from a future reactor in Virginia. The ARC plant is expected to come online in the early 2030s. Google is the first major company to sign on as a customer for commercial fusion energy. Unlike traditional nuclear power, fusion produces no carbon emissions and no long-lived radioactive waste. It also offers consistent, 24/7 electricity. As Google\u2019s AI systems drive up energy demand, this deal shows how tech companies are looking beyond wind and solar for scalable, future-proof solutions.

      "What happened in the Qantas data breach?",
      "On June 30, 2025, Qantas found unusual activity on a third-party customer service platform. Hackers broke into this system and took personal information, such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, and frequent flyer numbers.",
      "Qantas confirmed that hackers did not access credit card details, financial information, or passport data. The airline quickly stopped the breach and began telling affected customers. We reached out to Qantas for comment. They referred us to their official update, which says the system remains secure. No one compromised frequent flyer accounts or passwords. Qantas also reports no further threat activity. The airline is working with cybersecurity experts and government authorities to investigate.

That's exactly what researchers in Australia are doing: turning leftover coffee grounds into bricks. These bricks from recycled coffee grounds aren't just a quirky experiment. They're strong, sustainable, and could seriously cut down on construction emissions and costs. Here's how your daily brew is becoming the foundation for greener buildings.",

      "Firing bricks made from coffee waste. (Swinburne University)",
      "Bricks from recycled coffee grounds are cheaper and greener to make",
      "At Swinburne University of Technology, researchers found a creative way to cut both construction emissions and material costs by making bricks from recycled coffee grounds. Instead of letting all that coffee waste go to landfills, they partnered with local coffee shops to collect spent grounds straight from espresso machines. Then, by blending the coffee waste with natural clay and an alkali activator, they developed a recipe for low-emission bricks that are not only more sustainable but also faster and cheaper to produce than traditional clay ones.",
      "Coffee grounds from an espresso machine. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why bricks from recycled coffee grounds are a smarter use of waste",
      "Coffee is the world\u2019s second most popular beverage, beaten only by tea. As such, there are approximately two and a quarter billion cups of coffee consumed daily. If you average out the espressos, cappuccinos, and americanos, then each cup brews using roughly eleven grams of freshly ground coffee. However, that leads to over nine million tonnes of coffee bean grounds. In turn, this generates an estimated eighteen million tonnes of damp, burnt byproduct dumped into landfills every single year. So, there is an abundance of supply, but how can coffee grounds be more efficient than traditional clay bricks?",
      "How bricks from recycled coffee grounds cut construction costs",
      "This innovative method of using spent coffee grounds drastically reduces the energy needed to mold bricks. Even low-quality traditional clay bricks must be baked in a kiln at over 900 degrees Celsius. These new coffee bricks only need to be cooked at 200 degrees Celsius. That\u2019s an 80 percent reduction in energy usage, meaning that these bricks are significantly more efficient for both the environment and manufacturing costs.",
      "The lead scientist, Dr. Wong, claimed,\u00a0\"It\u2019s lighter on energy, faster to produce, and designed to reduce electricity-related CO\u2082 emissions by up to 80 percent per unit.\"",
      "Not only are the manufacturing costs lower, but experts claim these coffee bricks are remarkably durable. According to Green Brick, they double \"the Australian minimum standard for strength.\"",
      "Analysis of spent coffee grounds. (Swinburne University)",
      "Bricks from recycled coffee grounds offer sustainable building solutions",
      "In June, Swinburne University of Technology took a major step forward by signing an IP licensing deal with Australian company Green Brick. This partnership paves the way for using bricks made from recycled coffee grounds in real-world construction projects. Green Brick founder Philip Ng explained,\u00a0\"For the last century, materials have been judged by one thing: cost per square meter. But in the next chapter, we'll judge them by carbon, transparency, and circularity, and those metrics favor a new product.\"",
      "While Swinburne's team is transforming coffee waste, others around the world are exploring similar paths. In London, a group of researchers has developed \"sugarcrete,\" a bio-brick made from sugarcane waste. As these kinds of innovations gain traction, recycled organic materials are starting to look like a practical and scalable alternative for the construction industry.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It turns out your coffee habit might be more powerful than you think, not just for waking you up, but for building a cleaner future. Bricks from recycled coffee grounds are a creative solution to two big problems: construction pollution and coffee waste. As more researchers and companies get behind ideas like this, the future of sustainable building is looking a lot more grounded and a little more caffeinated.",

      "Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are transforming how we learn. But what does this mean for AI and learning retention? While these tools provide instant answers and personalized support, experts are beginning to question whether this convenience might actually reduce our ability to retain knowledge in the long term.",

      "ChatGPT app on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How AI changes the learning experience",
      "AI-powered platforms can personalize education by adapting to each learner's pace, style, and needs. This tailored approach is credited with boosting engagement and, in some cases, improving retention rates by up to 30%. Features like adaptive quizzes, intelligent tutoring, and spaced repetition are designed to reinforce memory and help information stick. For students who struggle with traditional methods, AI can break down barriers, making learning more accessible and inclusive.",
      "The double-edged sword: Convenience vs. deep learning",
      "However, recent research suggests that the very convenience AI offers may undermine long-term learning retention. In a series of experiments at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, participants who used LLMs like ChatGPT to research topics showed weaker understanding and produced less original insights compared to those who used traditional search engines. The reason? AI often delivers concise, ready-made answers, reducing the need for active engagement, critical thinking, and synthesis-key ingredients for lasting learning.",
      "A similar pattern emerged in a 2024 study involving high school students: those who relied on AI tools performed better on immediate assignments but scored lower on later tests that required recall and understanding without AI assistance. The researchers found that passive use of AI, simply asking for answers, can lead to superficial learning, where information is quickly forgotten.",
      "ChatGPT being used on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI affects learning retention more than you think",
      "Experts point to a \"motivation problem.\" When learners believe AI is smarter than they are, they may stop putting in effort, leading to shallower processing and weaker retention. Over-reliance on AI can also reduce opportunities to practice critical thinking and problem-solving, skills that are essential for deep, durable learning.",
      "Finding the right balance with AI and learning retention",
      "Despite these concerns, AI is not inherently bad for learning.

      "Redwood Materials, created by Tesla co-founder JB Straubel, is addressing the energy needs of AI through a new venture called Redwood Energy. Instead of sending used electric vehicle batteries straight to recycling, the company gives them a second life.",
      "The process begins by collecting and testing old EV battery packs. Many still retain over 50 percent of their original capacity. Once approved, these batteries are rebuilt into modular storage systems that can power AI operations.",
      "One example is a 12-megawatt, 63-megawatt-hour microgrid now supporting a 2,000-GPU data center operated by Crusoe in Nevada. This project is considered the largest active deployment of second-life EV batteries. It already operates more affordably than systems built with new batteries.",
      "Why repurposed EV batteries for AI data centers reduce emissions and costs",
      "The environmental and financial benefits are significant. By using repurposed EV batteries for AI data centers, companies avoid sending usable materials to landfills. This also cuts down on mining for new raw materials, which helps reduce carbon emissions.",
      "Second-life battery systems typically cost less than brand-new lithium-ion options. That makes large-scale energy storage more accessible to AI developers and utilities. Since these batteries are already built and tested, they can be installed more quickly than waiting for new infrastructure.",
      "Electric Vehicles charging their electric batteries. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How repurposed EV batteries for AI data centers help meet rising power demands",

      "The company already has more than 1 gigawatt-hour of second-life battery capacity in its development pipeline. Its goal is to reach 5 gigawatt-hours next year.",
      "Larger energy projects, including 100-megawatt sites, are also planned. Each one is designed to support the increasing power demands of AI data centers using repurposed batteries instead of new supply chains.",

      "His remains have never been returned.",
      "For his mother, Leah Goldin, the passage of time has only deepened the urgency. In a wide-ranging interview marking the grim milestone, she thanked President Donald Trump and his advisors for their efforts so far\u2014 and asked for them to ensure that no ceasefire, normalization deal or regional agreement moves forward without the return of her son.",
      "\"We are turning to and hoping that President Trump and his people \u2014 who understand this issue \u2014 will recognize that the real victory over Iran is to bring everyone home immediately and unconditionally.

      "\"These deals are a bluff \u2014 and this selective process is horrific. It\u2019s killing the families and the hostages. The further we go without bringing everyone back and ending this awful war, the more Hadar Goldins there will be. It\u2019s unbearable.\"",
      "Hadar Goldin was born to a prominent family of educators and raised on values of faith, service and compassion. Hadar was known for his gentle character, sharp intellect and deep artistic talent. He had just gotten engaged. In his free time, he drew portraits, wrote poetry and taught children with disabilities.",
      "He was serving in the elite Givati Brigade when, on Aug. 1, 2014, during Operation Protective Edge, Hamas violated a ceasefire \u2014 agreed upon hours earlier with U.S. and U.N. mediation \u2014 by launching a surprise attack. Hadar was killed and dragged into a tunnel inside Gaza.",
      "For his mother, that moment shattered not only her family\u2019s world, but also what she calls \"the Israeli military\u2019s sacred code.\"",
      "\"The IDF\u2019s ethos is never to leave a soldier behind,\" she said. \"But on August 28, 2014, Israel signed a ceasefire with Hamas without demanding Hadar\u2019s return. That broke something fundamental.\"",
      "Over the past decade, Leah Goldin has met with world leaders, lawmakers and military officials across the U.S. and Europe, seeking justice for her son and others like him. She points to U.N. Security Council Resolution 2474, passed in 2019, which obligates all parties to an armed conflict to return the remains of the dead as a humanitarian act and confidence-building measure.",

      "Today, Goldin sees a rare opportunity \u2014 a convergence of diplomatic efforts with Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Gaza \u2014 to demand Hadar\u2019s return before any agreements are finalized.",
      "\"Saudi Arabia has enormous leverage,\" she said. \"They\u2019re leading the Islamic world. If they want normalization with Israel, then let them demand the return of Hadar and all of the hostages as a gesture of goodwill.\"",
      "She also praised Steve Witkoff, a Trump envoy on both Iran and Saudi issues, and urged him to connect the dots. \"He\u2019s in charge of the deals. He knows the hostages matter. Don\u2019t say you\u2019ll finish the business and deal with the hostages later. That\u2019s immoral.\"",

      "Since Hamas\u2019 October 7 massacre, Leah and her family have taken on a new role: advising and supporting the families of current hostages through the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, a group they helped build in the days after the attack.",

      "\"This is a complex political environment right in the middle of a ceasefire negotiation,\" Chairman for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) Rev. Johnnie Moore told Fox News Digital. \"I understand on the first night of the ceasefire negotiation, one of the primary issues that Hamas and their negotiators brought up was they wanted to see the elimination of the GHF.",
      "\"Which ought to tell you something,\" he continued. \"Hamas didn't want 70 million meals of food in the Gaza Strip for the people they allege they care about \u2013 this is absurd.\"",
      "Following Israel\u2019s near-three-month blockade on aid to the Gaza Strip, the GHF \u2013 a U.S. and Israeli-backed aid mechanism \u2013 was, in late May, permitted to initiate food delivery with the assistance of the Israel Defense Force (IDF) as a means to ensure food trucks were not overrun and ransacked by the Hamas terrorist group.",
      "The GHF, which has faced stiff backlash for its divergence from traditional humanitarian assistance methods, has argued that its convoys have been far better secured from Hamas attacks than United Nations\u2019 delivery trucks, and therefore ensured the aid has actually ended up in the hands of Palestinian civilians.",
      "Hamas has long used humanitarian assistance as a means of control over Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and as a tool for recruitment, going so far as to threaten starving civilians from accepting\u00a0GHF food aid for their families in late May, telling them they \"will pay the price, and we will take the necessary measures.\"",
      "The GHF has delivered some 70 million meals to between 800,000 and 1 million Palestinians, Moore confirmed.",

      "The U.N. did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about whether it was the IDF or Hamas that was on the firing end of the gun, and whether these deaths occurred as a direct result of civilians seeking aid, chaotic eruptions that ensued outside of distribution centers, or if these were deaths occurred amid the continued war as civilians were in the process of heading to distributions centers.",
      "The IDF earlier this month said that following an investigation into civilian casualties reported at aid distribution sites, it had issued new orders to its South Command based on \"lessons learned.\"",
      "The GHF this week announced a second phase in its aid delivery system that could lower the threats civilians face when seeking aid, by distributing supplies directly through community leaders across Gaza \u2013 meaning there could be less travel involved for civilians in need.",
      "But the GHF also fervently rejects the U.N. death toll figures and Moore maintains that no deaths have occurred on or near their distribution sites.",
      "\"The U.N. is lying. They're just lying. They're taking statistics that originate from the Hamas-controlled Health Ministry in Gaza, and they're sharing those statistics without any scrutiny at all,\" Moore told Fox News Digital.",

      "The U.N., on the other hand, maintains that it vets its own informants and obtains evidence through \"various reliable sources, including medical, human rights and humanitarian organizations.\"",

      "While the U.N. has not officially called for the removal of the GHF, it has criticized the organization\u2019s \"militarized\" approach to delivering aid, which is not viewed as acceptable by the Sphere Association, which sets the international standards for humanitarian aid.",

      "\"I have been very clear that the U.N. cannot do humanitarian work alone in Gaza, we need partners,\" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told Fox News Digital. \"All that we ask is that these partners operate under the globally accepted humanitarian principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence.\"",
      "Though both sides ultimately have the same goal, there appears to be an increasing impasse over how to provide stable aid for Palestinians who continue to live in extremely dire situations.",
      "\"My mission, and the mission of GHF is really, really simple. It's just to feed people. And it should not be as controversial as it has been,\" Moore said. \"My interest has always been in the in the \u2018day after\u2019. We have to do both.\"",

    "story": [
      "Immigrants being held in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers in at least seven states are complaining of hunger, food shortages and spoiled food, detainees and immigration advocates say. They say some detainees have gotten sick; others say they have lost weight. In one facility, an incident involving detainees reportedly broke out in part because of food.",
      "The food problems come amid overcrowding at ICE facilities tied to the Trump administration\u2019s push to quickly ramp up immigration arrests. While capacity data isn\u2019t publicly available for every ICE detention facility, nationwide figures on the availability of beds show a system beyond its overall capacity. As of mid-June, ICE was detaining nearly 60,000 people, almost 45% above the capacity provided for by Congress.",
      "Although many of ICE\u2019s detention centers are run by private contractors, the problems are happening all over the country regardless of who\u2019s running a given facility, advocates say. A former ICE official told NBC News it is difficult for a facility to stay stocked with the right amount of food when, on any given day, it may face an unexpected surge of new detainees. While the agency can move money around to cover the cost of detaining more immigrants, planning for unexpected daily spikes can be difficult for facilities and could lead to food being served late or in small quantities, the former ICE official said.",
      "On top of that, there are now fewer avenues for detainees to submit concerns while they are in ICE custody, advocates say, pointing to recent job cuts to an independent watchdog within the Department of Homeland Security, ICE\u2019s parent agency.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any company-specific trends,\u201d said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel with the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt just goes to the overall detention system and how overcrowded the detention system is as a whole.\u201d",
      "Alfredo Parada Calderon, a Salvadoran man who has been detained for almost a year, says he has recently had meals that have left him feeling hungry.",
      "Detainees have sometimes been given flavorless meat that is so finely ground that it is almost liquefied, he told NBC News from the Golden State Annex detention facility in California.",
      "\u201cIt looks like little, small pebbles, and that will be the ounces that they give you,\u201d he said, referring to meat portions he has had in meals.",
      "Jennifer Norris, a directing attorney at the Immigrant Defenders Law Center with clients at multiple California detention centers, said it has gotten several complaints from clients in other facilities about the food being \u201cinedible\u201d and in one case \u201cmoldy.\u201d The complaints come as some centers reach capacity with recent arrests, she said.",
      "A woman named Rubimar, who asked that she and her husband, Jose, be identified by their first names only because he was deported Wednesday and fears fallout in Venezuela as a result of talking to the media, said Jose was detained by ICE in El Paso, Texas, for about three months and had complained about a lack of food there.",
      "\u201cHe tells me many are given two spoonfuls of rice and that many are still hungry,\u201d Rubimar said in an interview before Jose was deported to Venezuela.",
      "Russian immigrant detainee Ilia Chernov said the conditions, including food, have gotten worse since he was detained at the Winn Correctional Center in Louisiana on July 24, 2024.",
      "\u201cThe portions got smaller,\u201d Chernov said through a Russian translator. \u201cI have to deal with hunger, so I am getting used to the hunger. So I have lost weight.\u201d",
      "DHS said Winn Correctional Center has received no complaints from Russian detainees. However, Chernov\u2019s lawyers said he has submitted complaints about food to ICE in writing, at least one as recently as April.",
      "The detainees\u2019 complaints are consistent with what advocates say they are hearing from other detainees and their lawyers across the country.",
      "Liliana Chumpitasi, who runs a hotline for detainees at the immigration advocacy group La Resistencia in Washington state, said she gets 10 to 20 calls a day from ICE detainees complaining about conditions. They have told her that the meals used to be delivered on a regular schedule, such as 6 a.m. for breakfast and noon for lunch, but that now breakfast may not come until 9 a.m. and dinner is often not served until midnight. Some detainees have also said meals are now half the size they were last year, she said.",
      "According to ICE\u2019s food service standards, detainees are required to be served three meals a day, two of which are supposed to be hot, and with \u201cno more than 14 hours between the evening meal and breakfast.\u201d",
      "Congress has funded ICE to detain up to 41,500 people, including facilities, food, staffing and supplies. But as of the week of July 7, ICE had over 57,000 detainees in its facilities across the country, according to ICE data. However, there is an expectation that more space will be added with the passage this month of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d which allocates $45 billion for ICE detention centers until the end of September 2029. According to an estimate by the American Immigration Council, that amount could \u201clikely fund an increase in ICE detention to at least 116,000 beds\u201d per year.",
      "Two other former ICE officials said the agency can hold more people than Congress has funded it for but only for short periods. A current senior ICE official, who asked not to be named to freely discuss ongoing funding issues, said the agency has pulled money from other parts of DHS to continue funding detention through Sept. 30.",
      "Asked about specific allegations of food scarcity and substandard food, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News in a statement, \u201cAny claim that there is lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment and have opportunity to communicate with their family members and lawyers,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cMeals are certified by dieticians. Ensuring the safety, security and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.\u201d",
      "\u2018Improper food handling practices\u2019",
      "In Tacoma, Washington, at the Northwest ICE Processing Center, Chumpitasi fears the increase in people being held there has contributed to poor food safety.",
      "Seven food violations have been found there in 2025 so far, compared with two in 2024 and one in 2023, according to inspection data by the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department. According to ICE data, 1,081 people were detained there as of June 23, compared with 719 at the end of fiscal year 2024 and 570 at the end of fiscal year 2023. (The federal government\u2019s fiscal year runs through Sept. 30.)",
      "One morning in mid-April, the facility contacted the local Health Department to report 57 cases of suspected foodborne illness, with symptoms including diarrhea, stomachache and bloating, according to the Health Department. After an investigation, the department concluded that reheated collard greens that had been served at the facility had tested positive for Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. The collard greens were a substitute food for that day and not posted on the day\u2019s menu, according to health department documents. Food poisoning caused by Bacillus cereus is often related to leftover food that has been improperly cooled or reheated.",
      "The Health Department went back to the Northwest Processing Center for an unannounced visit and found \u201cseveral improper food handling practices.\u201d It worked with the staff there to correct them, and as of June 18 the facility had passed inspection.",
      "Asked about that, McLaughlin said in an email, \u201cWhile the Health Department was notified, the on-site medical team concluded that there was no evidence linking the illness to a specific food item, as claimed by the detainees.\u201d",
      "\u2018I am getting used to the hunger\u2019",
      "Over the past month, the American Immigration Lawyers Association has received at least a dozen food-related complaints from advocacy groups and lawyers representing detainees across the country, according to Dojaquez-Torres.",
      "\u201cThe common complaint is that there is just not enough food,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWhat I am hearing is that there are extended periods of time when people are not being fed, and when they are, they are being given chips or a slice of bread.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have been getting reports from around the country from our members ... and conditions have been declining rapidly,\u201d she said. She also said that some detainees haven\u2019t been given beds and that some have said they aren\u2019t given access to showers.",
      "In early June, a \u201cmelee\u201d broke out in Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey, because of conditions inside the facility, which included \u201cpaltry meals served at irregular hours,\u201d according to The New York Times, which spoke to several lawyers representing detainees inside the facility and family members.",
      "Geo Group pushed back against the Times\u2019 reporting in an emailed statement at the time, saying, \u201cContrary to current reporting, there has been no widespread unrest at the facility.\u201d",
      "DHS also denied allegations of food issues at the Newark immigration detention facility when NBC News asked about them.",
      "\u201cAllegations that there are chronic food shortages at Delaney Hall are unequivocally false. The facility regularly reviews any detainee complaints. The Food Service Operations Director conducted a review of food portions and detainees are being fed the portions as prescribed by the nutritionist, based on a daily 2400 to 2600 caloric intake,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "DHS didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up question about how recently the food service operations director \u2014 or any oversight body reviewing food in ICE detention facilities nationwide \u2014 had last visited and made an assessment.",
      "In late May, Rubimar said, her husband, Jose, had called and told her that the gas at his facility wasn\u2019t functioning and that they had been given only a bag of tuna to eat in the meantime. But even before that, she said, her husband said the food was \u201ctoo little.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin said a dietitian had recently approved the meal plan at the El Paso Service Processing Center and indicated \u201cthe total caloric intake for ICE detainees at the facility was 3,436 per day \u2014 which exceeds the average daily recommended minimums.\u201d",
      "LaSalle Corrections, which operates the Winn Correctional Center, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "The GEO Group, which operates the ICE facilities in Newark and Tacoma, as well as the Golden State Annex and many others nationwide, didn\u2019t respond to specific allegations about food service and instead provided this statement: \u201cWe are proud of the role our company has played for 40 years to support the law enforcement mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Over the last four decades, our innovative support service solutions have helped the federal government implement the policies of seven different Presidential Administrations. In all instances, our support services are monitored by ICE, including on-site agency personnel, and other organizations within the Department of Homeland Security to ensure strict compliance with ICE detention standards.\u201d",
      "Reduced oversight",
      "Beyond overcrowding, immigration advocates also blame the alleged food issues at detention facilities in part on cutbacks to a team of inspectors inside DHS.",
      "The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, an office that previously oversaw conditions inside ICE and ICE-contracted facilities, was entirely or mainly shuttered this year after the \u201cmajority of the workforce\u201d was issued reduction-in-force notices, according to ongoing litigation regarding the cuts.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that made the [Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman] is that we actually had case managers in the facilities and they were accessible to the detainees,\u201d a former DHS employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about future government employment. \u201cThey would actually go into the kitchen [to see] if there were deficiencies and work with kitchen management.\u201d",
      "Karla Gilbride, a lawyer with Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group suing the Trump administration over the firings of people in the office, said the office has been completely dismantled.",
      "\u201cThat is our position, that they have shut down the office. They put everyone on leave. They were told to stop interacting with everyone who filed complaints\u201d from detention, Gilbride said.",
      "The former DHS employee said the dismantling of the ombudsman\u2019s office means detainees have fewer options if they have complaints or concerns about things like food, overcrowding, sanitation, access to legal counsel and clean clothes.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, it really just means that there are less people to sound an alarm,\u201d the former DHS employee said.",
      "McLaughlin didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about the dismantling of the ombudsman\u2019s office. DHS has maintained in court filings that the ombudsman\u2019s office remains open and that efforts to restaff certain positions affected by the layoffs are underway.",
      "In a status report filed in court in early July, government lawyers said they are onboarding three new employees at the ombudsman\u2019s office and that files have been created for all new complaints since the end of March."

    "summary": "In the course of a few weeks, Trump has faced a pushback from prominent supporters, including Tucker Carlson.",
    "story": [
      "As President Donald Trump weighed U.S. involvement in the conflict between Israel and Iran last month, some influential members of his online MAGA army began to question what he was doing.",
      "But few were prominent enough to face a direct response from the president.",
      "\u201cSomebody please explain to kooky Tucker Carlson that, \u2018IRAN CAN NOT HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON!\u2019\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\u201d Trump said in response to a reporter\u2019s question at the Group of Seven summit the same day. \u201cLet him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\u201d",
      "In the course of a few weeks, Trump has faced a surprising level of pushback from prominent supporters as he moved to strike nuclear facilities in Iran, floated a new policy to allow undocumented farmworkers to remain in the United States and castigated allies for demanding more information related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Even in that environment, Carlson, regarded as a MAGA standard-bearer, stood out.",
      "\u201cI like Trump. I campaigned for Trump,\u201d Carlson said in an interview, adding: \u201cBut I\u2019ve got my views. I assume that we will overlap on most things, and I hope that, by the way, the bombing of the nuclear sites in Iran, which I did not support, I hope it works out great, and I\u2019ll be grateful if it does. And I\u2019ll be the first to say I was wrong for the millionth time in my life.\u201d",
      "In June, Carlson said Trump was \u201ccomplicit in the act of war\u201d as Israel launched attacks on Iran. (Trump later said Carlson \u201ccalled and apologized.\u201d) One month before, Carlson echoed concerns about Trump\u2019s business dealings in the Middle East, saying \u201cit seems like corruption\u201d when Shawn Ryan, a guest on his program, raised alarm about new Trump properties in the region. And now, he is taking the administration to task for declining to release additional information about Epstein, with whom Trump had a yearslong friendship before a falling-out.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the U.S. government, the one that I voted for, refused to take my question seriously and instead said, \u2018Case closed, shut up conspiracy theorist,\u2019 was too much for me,\u201d Carlson said Friday at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit, where he devoted his speech to the issue. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the rest of us should be satisfied with that.\u201d",
      "Carlson emphasized his personal admiration for Trump but took issue with his response to the furor over the Epstein files. At a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump brushed off growing discontent and said it was \u201ca desecration\u201d to ask about Epstein after flooding in Texas killed dozens.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not adequate to say anyone who asked [questions] is somehow desecrating the memory of little girls who died in Texas,\u201d Carlson said in his speech Friday, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t care who gives that answer. That is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "Carlson\u2019s frustrations represent broader discontent in MAGA world with the policies of the man who brought them together. It\u2019s a key moment for the movement, which for the past decade has been largely in lockstep, testing whether it\u2019s willing to truly break with Trump and whether anyone besides Trump can shape its direction.",
      "\u2018I was never an important adviser to Trump\u2019",
      "Asked about his direct discussions with Trump, Carlson said he \u201ccertainly had a lot of conversations with him,\u201d though he declined to say when the two men last spoke.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a policymaker,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy with opinions. I don\u2019t work there. I\u2019ve never worked in any government. I\u2019ve never taken any money from any politician or any government, and I just have strong views, which, by the way, are sometimes wrong, really wrong. I supported the Iraq War. So my track record is spotty.\u201d",
      "And Carlson said he was unaware whether his influence in the White House has waned in light of his recent commentary.",
      "\u201cI was never an important adviser to Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always kind of overstated.\u201d",
      "Carlson was center stage among MAGA influencers arguing for the United States to stay out of Iran, a position that has gained popularity on the right as some right-wing influencers have increasingly viewed the U.S.-Israel alliance with skepticism. That stance is also informed by Trump\u2019s having promoted similar anti-war and anti-interventionist views for years, even as he has used military force as president. Ultimately, Carlson said, the most important voice arguing the case to Trump for the U.S. bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "\u201cTurns out a head of state of an important ally has a more compelling message than I do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems reasonable to me. I still disagree, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like Trump has changed his views entirely.\u201d",
      "Some around Trump have taken a victory lap given that he ultimately didn\u2019t ally with Carlson on military action in Iran.",
      "\u201cThe Iran operation was both a shot at the Iranians, but it was also a shot at the restrainers of the administration and at Tucker and everyone else who said the president is never going to do this,\u201d a Trump ally close to the administration said. \u201cThey think he\u2019s an ideologue like they are, and he isn\u2019t. These guys overplayed their hands.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Carlson has had peaks and valleys dating to his first administration. Most notably, during Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 2023 court battle against Fox News, the judge made public text messages showing Carlson\u2019s trashing Trump amid his effort to overturn his 2020 loss, in which he privately said, \u201cI hate him passionately.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s never been a natural ally of the president,\u201d a second Trump ally said, pointing to the texts.",
      "But the two reconciled during Trump\u2019s third run for the White House as both were in exile: Carlson having been ousted from Fox News as part of the fallout over the Dominion lawsuit and Trump facing multiple indictments, including in connection with his role in trying to reverse his 2020 defeat.",
      "When Carlson was forced out of his show in 2023, Trump said he was \u201cshocked,\u201d adding, \u201cHe\u2019s a very good person and a very good man and very talented, as you know, and he had very high ratings.\u201d The strengthening of their relationship led Carlson to campaign for Trump, including in a prime-time speaking slot at last summer\u2019s Republican convention.",
      "Given Carlson\u2019s stature in the MAGA movement, prominent Trump allies have come to his defense. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said last month that Carlson \u201cis one of my favorite people.\u201d Arguing against intervention in Iran, she added, was \u201cnot kooky.\u201d",
      "Steve Bannon, the former White House aide and MAGA media personality, who occupies a perch similar to Carlson\u2019s, said the brouhaha between the two men comes during \u201ca time of turmoil\u201d when Trump is handling a number of crises at once. He said Carlson is \u201cstill one of the leaders of our movement and an incredibly strong, independent voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cTucker has always worked at this a little more with a jaundiced eye,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cHe came to this movement late. He waited and measured it. He respects President Trump; he supported President Trump. When Tucker took on the ruling class, it was a seminal moment for MAGA \u2014 because he did it on Fox prime time. Since then, Tucker has been there for \u2018America First,\u2019 especially when it mattered most.\u201d",
      "More broadly, Bannon said, MAGA influencers and thought leaders have to call out policy decisions that veer from base expectations in hope of ensuring their perspective is represented.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to represent every day and continue to make sure that people understand, particularly people around President Trump, and sometimes even the president himself, understands where we think core values lie,\u201d Bannon said.",
      "\u2018A dissident figure\u2019",
      "It\u2019s not as if Carlson hadn\u2019t publicly criticized Trump or his administration before. He similarly sounded the alarm in 2020 when the United States killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and he criticized Trump\u2019s handling of national protests after Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd later that year. While such pushback isn\u2019t new, a person close to Carlson said he has never crossed the line into all-consuming criticism like Matt Drudge or Ann Coulter, other conservative media personalities who have sharply broken with Trump.",
      "\u201cTucker\u2019s not being malicious towards the president at all,\u201d a source close to the White House said. \u201cYou can very easily still support somebody and disagree with a specific policy decision. Agree with him or disagree with him, Tucker is at least coming from a sincere place of love and concern for the president. He just wants the president to be successful and is worried that issues like amnesty, Epstein, Ukraine funding and war in the Middle East could eventually lead to his presidency being derailed.\u201d",
      "Trump maintains high approval ratings with the Republican base, which is informing how he and the White House view the pushback online. An Economist/YouGov survey published Tuesday found that 87% of Republicans approve of Trump\u2019s handling of his job so far.",
      "\u201cThe president cares deeply about the MAGA base; he is very responsive to them,\u201d a person familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking said.",
      "This person pointed to online chatter last week about whether Trump would offer some sort of \u201camnesty\u201d after he talked up an effort at a rally to allow undocumented farmworkers to stay in the country, noting that at a Cabinet meeting, Trump was responsive to the concerns and said there would be \u201cno amnesty.\u201d",
      "\u201cThings like that are notable when thinking about how the president balances the viewpoints he\u2019s getting,\u201d the person added. \u201cAnd a lot of what he\u2019s done recently are direct responses to so many of the campaign promises made to the base.\u201d",
      "A MAGA thought leader described Trump and Carlson as \u201ctwo of the great minds of MAGA,\u201d saying the movement wouldn\u2019t exist in its current form without either one. This person worried the MAGA perspective was \u201cgetting a little squeezed out of the inner circle\u201d at the White House on several issues of note.",
      "\u201cPeople are not going to go along with endless war,\u201d this person said. \u201cAnd when they see the capitulation on Epstein, it just hurts. The Trump administration made overtures that they were serious about this. But six months in and kind of trying to tie a bow around it, it\u2019s just not satisfying. That\u2019s not going to sit well.\u201d",
      "No other issue has tested the MAGA base\u2019s commitment to Trump like the Epstein files.",
      "For years, many on the right \u2014 including some people who are now in the Trump administration \u2014 have called for the release of all government documents related to Epstein. Epstein died in custody in 2019, and a medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. He was facing sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "Last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi released a memo saying the Justice Department\u2019s review turned up no \u201cclient list\u201d of powerful men alleged to have participated in Epstein\u2019s schemes, enraging the MAGA base, who are calling on her to be fired. Trump\u2019s defense of Bondi and his attempts to tell his supporters to move on from the issue have done little to quell the furor.",
      "On Saturday, Trump wrote \u201cLET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB \u2014 SHE\u2019S GREAT!\u201d on Truth Social, adding the United States should \u201cnot waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\u201d",
      "In his NBC News interview, Carlson said he now believes the Justice Department actually doesn\u2019t have \u201cmuch relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than just admit that, Pam Bondi made a bunch of ludicrous claims on cable news shows that she couldn\u2019t back up, and this current outrage is the result,\u201d he said.",
      "A Republican Senate aide thinks Carlson is actually having a bit of a \u201crevival\u201d as he carves out distinct space on the right.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s more of a dissident figure now,\u201d this person said. \u201cFor whatever else you\u2019re going to say, Tucker is just kind of saying what he thinks.\u201d",
      "No recent moment generated more buzz for Carlson than his contentious and combative interview with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, which put the MAGA divide over the conflict between Israel and Iran on full display. Even with the administration not siding with him, Carlson said he\u2019s \u201creally grateful\u201d that there\u2019s significant debate on the right over a litany of policy issues.",
      "As for his assessment of the first six months of Trump\u2019s second presidency, he said, \u201cI think they\u2019re trying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most important thing, not just for Republicans, not even for all the first-time Republican voters who supported Trump, but just for the country,\u201d Carlson said, \u201cis to make it clear that you\u2019re trying to achieve what you said you would achieve.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The number of young children sickened after getting their little hands on nicotine products like pouches and vape e-liquids has skyrocketed in recent years.",
      "From 2010 through 2023, U.S. poison centers reported 134,663 cases of nicotine poisonings among kids under age 6, according to a study published Monday in Pediatrics, a journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Nearly all occurred at home.",
      "The cases included exposures to nicotine pouches, chewing tobacco, regular cigarettes, vapes and nicotine replacement products like gum and lozenges.",
      "But it\u2019s nicotine pouches, like the wildly popular Zyn, that are behind the most significant rise in accidental nicotine poisonings among young kids.",
      "The new research found that the rate of poisonings involving nicotine pouches among kids under 6 rose from 0.48 per 100,000 children in 2020 to 4.14 per 100,000 in 2023.",
      "That\u2019s an increase of 763% in just three years \u2014 a startling finding that correlates with a surge in sales of nicotine pouches.",
      "Nicotine pouches \u2014 which users tuck between their lip and gum and later discard \u2014 can contain as much as 6 milligrams of nicotine, a stimulant, and have been promoted as tobacco-free, spit-free and hands-free alternatives to cigarettes and chewing tobacco.",
      "They are not, however, approved by the Food and Drug Administration as nicotine replacement products used to help quit smoking.",
      "A 2021 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Office on Smoking and Health (one of several public health groups dismantled under the Trump administration) found that sales of nicotine pouches rose dramatically in the past decade, from $709,000 in 2016 to $216 million by mid-2020.",
      "\u201cIt was just a matter of time before they fell into the hands of younger kids,\u201d said Dr. Molly O\u2019Shea, a Michigan pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but not shocking.\u201d",
      "Why is nicotine toxic to little kids?",
      "Nicotine is a chemical that\u2019s highly toxic and could easily exceed a fatal dose in small children, according to a 2013 study.",
      "The chemical increases heart rate and blood pressure, and could lead to nausea, vomiting or even coma, the study authors wrote.",
      "Most cases included in the new research weren\u2019t serious enough to warrant medical attention. But 39 children had significant side effects, like trouble breathing and seizures, said Natalie Rine, an author of the new study and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus.",
      "Most nicotine poisoning cases, 76%, were babies and toddlers under age 2.",
      "Two children, a 1-year-old boy and another boy about a year and a half old, died after ingesting liquid nicotine used in vapes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good that the majority of kids in the study actually did pretty well. Most kids had either minor symptoms or no symptoms and didn\u2019t require any medical management,\u201d Rine said. \u201cBut two deaths is a lot, especially for something considered a preventable death.\u201d",
      "How to reduce nicotine poisonings in kids",
      "Kids are curious by nature. Babies and toddlers in particular explore their worlds by putting things in their mouth.",
      "And they\u2019re masters at breaking into drawers and cabinets to find new \u201ctoys.\u201d Canisters of nicotine pouches are not equipped with child-resistant packaging. They taste good, too. Mint and fruit flavors are almost always added.",
      "O\u2019Shea said it\u2019s critical that all nicotine products are placed far out of reach of children. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean in your purse, in your back pocket or on the counter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means locked away.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just parents and other adult caregivers who must be mindful of their nicotine products. An April study from the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California found the use of nicotine pouches among high school students nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy for a teenager to be using this product and have parents be unaware,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for parents to be talking with their teenagers about products like this and having open dialogue in a nonjudgmental way in order to ascertain any risk.\u201d",
      "Rine also recommends adding the national poison control number to cellphones: 1-800-222-1222."

      "His comments came after he lost his appeal against the U.K. government\u2019s decision to axe his publicly funded security detail, an issue that he said had driven a wedge between him and his father.",
      "\u201cHe won\u2019t speak to me because of this security stuff,\u201d Harry said, adding that he didn\u2019t know how long his father had left to live after Charles was diagnosed with cancer last year.",
      "Relations between the pair became strained after Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, announced that they would take a step back as senior members of the Royal Family in 2020, saying they would split their time between the U.K. and U.S.",
      "As a result, the couple was stripped of their taxpayer-funded security, spurring Harry\u2019s legal challenge with the U.K. Home Office.",
      "Harry has been a regular in British courts in recent years, challenging both his security arrangements and tabloid newspaper publishers for allegedly hacking phones and using private investigators to snoop on his life for news stories.",
      "Harry has also openly expressed his frustrations with his family, who were the source of pointed criticism in Harry\u2019s best-selling book, \u201cSpare,\u201d two years ago, which saw him claim that he had been physically attacked by his brother William, the Prince of Wales.",
      "This came after Harry and Meghan alleged in a 2021 interview with Oprah Winfrey that a member of the Royal Family had expressed concerns over the skin color of their son Archie before he was born."

      "Ethan Chapin, one of four University of Idaho students stabbed to death in the fall of 2022, had a lighthearted, sometimes goofy presence his family still feels today.",
      "The 6-foot-4-inch student rarely took things too seriously, they said, making their loss staggering and their recovery a daily battle against the weight of darkness.",
      "\"The days do get better,\" Stacy Chapin, speaking alongside her husband, Jim, said for the couple's first major sit-down interview, airing Monday morning on \"TODAY.\"",
      "The Chapins were present July 2 when defendant Bryan Kohberger pleaded guilty to four counts of first-degree murder under an agreement that will skip a painful trial, a godsend for the Chapins. He'll remain behind bars until his last breath.",
      "\"It was cold and calculated and weirdly, like an automated phone message,\" Stacy Chapin said of seeing the defendant in person for the first time. \"I mean, it was just like you expected some, I don't know, remorse, emotion, something. And there was zero.\"",
      "His plea has so far come without an explanation or a disclosure of a motive, but nearly three years after the violence, the Chapins say they don't need an explanation anymore.",
      "\"If I could physically do a handstand, I'd probably do one, because I am so ready,\" Jim Chapin said. \"I'm ready for my kids to move on. I'm ready for us to move on. I mean, it's been almost 2\u00bd years, and it's, just, it's over.\"",
      "Sentencing is July 23 in Boise.",
      "The Chapins say that, even with the deal, it's possible that Kohberger will never explain what drove him to 1122 King Road early on Nov. 13, 2022, when he entered a home not his own and drove his knife repeatedly into the flesh of four University of Idaho students before a surviving roommate saw him leave wearing a ski mask, she said.",
      "Ethan Chapin was a 20-year-old freshman studying recreation, sport and tourism management. His minors? Bud Light Lime and Taco Bell, his parents say.",
      "In many ways, Kohberger contrasted his victims' optimism and fun with a demanding demeanor that got him into trouble at Washington State University Global Campus in Pullman, about 8 miles from King Road.",
      "Students there and other sources said Kohberger, a doctoral student in criminology, was under fire for his attitude in his teaching assistant role, grading papers and counseling students. Some students complained, they said, and he was called in for meetings.",
      "Kohberger\u2019s social media surfing in the fall of 2022, reviewed by NBC News, showed he binged on the imagery of some of the friends and followers of the three women killed in the attack.",
      "One of them, Xana Kernodle, 20, was Chapin's girlfriend and the reason he was at King Road that morning, authorities have said. Housemates Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves, both 21, were also slain.",
      "Motive might ultimately end up locked up for good with Kohberger, who hasn't spoken about it.",
      "\"I don't believe that we will ever learn that, and I don't need to know,\" Stacy Chapin said. \"It doesn't change the outcome. It's a horrific event. We've gotten through it. I mean, as best as we can, as we continue to heal every single day.\"",
      "The plea agreement saved their surviving children, Maisie and Hunter, born alongside Ethan as triplets, from possibly having to testify about him at trial, the Chapins said. The deal raised eyebrows among some of the victims' parents.",
      "\"Our first, our initial response was like, the eye, an eye for an eye,\" Stacy Chapin said.",
      "But after speaking with prosecutors and family, the Chapins concluded \"this was a better deal,\" she said.",
      "\"He gets put away, and there's no appeal system to it, and there were so many kids, including our own, that had been subpoenaed that no longer have this hanging over their heads,\" Stacy added.",
      "Jim Chapin said locking the defendant away will prevent him from killing anyone, including college students, again.",
      "\"I really don't care what happens to the guy,\" he said. \"He's off the streets. He can't hurt any more kids.\"",
      "For the Chapins, the deal is done, and they're now happy with it. They're not even planning to attend sentencing because they feel the case wrapped the minute the defendant said \"guilty.\"",
      "It was the point at which the couple was finally ready to move on, Jim Chapin said.",
      "\"There's big-time closure,\" he said.",
      "Maisie and Hunter recently completed undergraduate studies at the University of Idaho, the couple said, and took part in commencement ceremonies as the Chapins beamed.",
      "Their parents hated the possibility of their children having to testify and endure \"memory lane\" style displays of imagery from Ethan's childhood, a painful prospect, they said.",
      "A successful prosecution wasn\u2019t guaranteed, opening up the possibility of a second trial and more pain, they said. And even if Kohberger were found guilty of capital murder, executions can take decades and involve hearings that would bring the Chapins right back to their ringside seats to relive their greatest loss.",
      "While relatives of other victims were unhappy with the way the plea agreement with the defendant was rolled out, the Chapins were ready to say goodbye to all of it. Their appearance on the Prime Video docuseries \"One Night in Idaho: The College Murders,\" which debuted over the weekend, was calculated, the couple said.",
      "\"We got to control the narrative when it comes to Ethan,\" Stacy Chapin said. \"This is our version of Ethan, who was incredible. We set out consciously to make sure that it was our story, our Ethan.\"",
      "Directors Liz Garbus and Matthew Galkin \"knocked it out of the park\" in portraying Ethan's airy outlook, Jim Chapin said.",
      "The Chapins' loss nearly paralyzed the couple: \"Crying in your coffee\" every morning is how Stacy Chapin described their life. But the two consciously dug themselves out of sorrow and misery and eventually were able to establish a foundation in Ethan's name, Ethan's Smile, which has given scholarships to more than 80 students.",
      "And Stacy got moving literally, on her treadmill, step by step.",
      "\"You hike your demons out,\" she said.",
      "It's clear that the couple have emerged and that they are happy not to have the daily tribulations of a trial filling up their heads. They've let go of much of that, but they say Ethan will always resonate in the household.",
      "\"He just could just blow into any room and had something funny to say,\" Stacy said. \"Elevated everything, you know, just the energy in a room. His Jeep is here. His things are here. He's here.\""

      "President Donald Trump said Sunday that the U.S. is sending Ukraine badly needed Patriot air defense missiles to help it fend off Russia\u2019s intensifying aerial attacks.",
      "Trump did not give a number of Patriots he plans to send to Kyiv but said the European Union was \u201cgoing to pay us 100% for that, and that\u2019s the way we want it.\u201d",
      "Trump's special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, arrived in Kyiv on Monday, a senior Ukrainian official said, as anticipation grew over possible changes in the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the more than three-year war.",
      "Trump last week teased that he would make a \u201cmajor statement\u201d on Russia on Monday. Trump made quickly stopping the war one of his diplomatic priorities, and he has increasingly expressed frustration about Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s unbudging stance.",
      "Putin \u201ctalks nice and then he bombs everybody,\u201d Trump said late Sunday after saying the U.S. would send missiles to Ukraine and the European Union would pay the cost of the weapons.",
      "Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said when asked about Trump's plan to send missiles to Ukraine through Europe, \"the fact remains that the supplies of weapons, ammunition, and military equipment from the USA to Ukraine have continued and continue.\u201d",
      "There are \u201cvery positive signs\u201d from Washington on the sale of Patriot air defence systems for Ukraine, a German defence ministry spokesperson told Reuters on Monday.",

As of mid-June, ICE was detaining nearly 60,000 people, almost 45% above the capacity provided for by Congress.",
      "Although many of ICE\u2019s detention centers are run by private contractors, the problems are happening all over the country regardless of who\u2019s running a given facility, advocates say. A former ICE official told NBC News it is difficult for a facility to stay stocked with the right amount of food when, on any given day, it may face an unexpected surge of new detainees. While the agency can move money around to cover the cost of detaining more immigrants, planning for unexpected daily spikes can be difficult for facilities and could lead to food being served late or in small quantities, the former ICE official said.",
      "On top of that, there are now fewer avenues for detainees to submit concerns while they are in ICE custody, advocates say, pointing to recent job cuts to an independent watchdog within the Department of Homeland Security, ICE\u2019s parent agency.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any company-specific trends,\u201d said Vanessa Dojaquez-Torres, practice and policy counsel with the American Immigration Lawyers Association. \u201cIt just goes to the overall detention system and how overcrowded the detention system is as a whole.\u201d",
      "Alfredo Parada Calderon, a Salvadoran man who has been detained for almost a year, says he has recently had meals that have left him feeling hungry.",
      "Detainees have sometimes been given flavorless meat that is so finely ground that it is almost liquefied, he told NBC News from the Golden State Annex detention facility in California.",
      "\u201cIt looks like little, small pebbles, and that will be the ounces that they give you,\u201d he said, referring to meat portions he has had in meals.",
      "Jennifer Norris, a directing attorney at the Immigrant Defenders Law Center with clients at multiple California detention centers, said it has gotten several complaints from clients in other facilities about the food being \u201cinedible\u201d and in one case \u201cmoldy.\u201d The complaints come as some centers reach capacity with recent arrests, she said.",
      "A woman named Rubimar, who asked that she and her husband, Jose, be identified by their first names only because he was deported Wednesday and fears fallout in Venezuela as a result of talking to the media, said Jose was detained by ICE in El Paso, Texas, for about three months and had complained about a lack of food there.",
      "\u201cHe tells me many are given two spoonfuls of rice and that many are still hungry,\u201d Rubimar said in an interview before Jose was deported to Venezuela.",
      "Russian immigrant detainee Ilia Chernov said the conditions, including food, have gotten worse since he was detained at the Winn Correctional Center in Louisiana on July 24, 2024.",
      "\u201cThe portions got smaller,\u201d Chernov said through a Russian translator. \u201cI have to deal with hunger, so I am getting used to the hunger. So I have lost weight.\u201d",
      "DHS said Winn Correctional Center has received no complaints from Russian detainees. However, Chernov\u2019s lawyers said he has submitted complaints about food to ICE in writing, at least one as recently as April.",
      "The detainees\u2019 complaints are consistent with what advocates say they are hearing from other detainees and their lawyers across the country.",
      "Liliana Chumpitasi, who runs a hotline for detainees at the immigration advocacy group La Resistencia in Washington state, said she gets 10 to 20 calls a day from ICE detainees complaining about conditions. They have told her that the meals used to be delivered on a regular schedule, such as 6 a.m. for breakfast and noon for lunch, but that now breakfast may not come until 9 a.m. and dinner is often not served until midnight. Some detainees have also said meals are now half the size they were last year, she said.",
      "According to ICE\u2019s food service standards, detainees are required to be served three meals a day, two of which are supposed to be hot, and with \u201cno more than 14 hours between the evening meal and breakfast.\u201d",
      "Congress has funded ICE to detain up to 41,500 people, including facilities, food, staffing and supplies. But as of the week of July 7, ICE had over 57,000 detainees in its facilities across the country, according to ICE data. However, there is an expectation that more space will be added with the passage this month of President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill,\u201d which allocates $45 billion for ICE detention centers until the end of September 2029. According to an estimate by the American Immigration Council, that amount could \u201clikely fund an increase in ICE detention to at least 116,000 beds\u201d per year.",
      "Two other former ICE officials said the agency can hold more people than Congress has funded it for but only for short periods. A current senior ICE official, who asked not to be named to freely discuss ongoing funding issues, said the agency has pulled money from other parts of DHS to continue funding detention through Sept. 30.",
      "Asked about specific allegations of food scarcity and substandard food, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told NBC News in a statement, \u201cAny claim that there is lack of food or subprime conditions at ICE detention centers are false.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment and have opportunity to communicate with their family members and lawyers,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cMeals are certified by dieticians. Ensuring the safety, security and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.\u201d",
      "\u2018Improper food handling practices\u2019",
      "In Tacoma, Washington, at the Northwest ICE Processing Center, Chumpitasi fears the increase in people being held there has contributed to poor food safety.",
      "Seven food violations have been found there in 2025 so far, compared with two in 2024 and one in 2023, according to inspection data by the Tacoma-Pierce County Health Department. According to ICE data, 1,081 people were detained there as of June 23, compared with 719 at the end of fiscal year 2024 and 570 at the end of fiscal year 2023. (The federal government\u2019s fiscal year runs through Sept. 30.)",
      "One morning in mid-April, the facility contacted the local Health Department to report 57 cases of suspected foodborne illness, with symptoms including diarrhea, stomachache and bloating, according to the Health Department. After an investigation, the department concluded that reheated collard greens that had been served at the facility had tested positive for Bacillus cereus, a bacterium that can cause food poisoning. The collard greens were a substitute food for that day and not posted on the day\u2019s menu, according to health department documents. Food poisoning caused by Bacillus cereus is often related to leftover food that has been improperly cooled or reheated.",
      "The Health Department went back to the Northwest Processing Center for an unannounced visit and found \u201cseveral improper food handling practices.\u201d It worked with the staff there to correct them, and as of June 18 the facility had passed inspection.",
      "Asked about that, McLaughlin said in an email, \u201cWhile the Health Department was notified, the on-site medical team concluded that there was no evidence linking the illness to a specific food item, as claimed by the detainees.\u201d",
      "\u2018I am getting used to the hunger\u2019",
      "Over the past month, the American Immigration Lawyers Association has received at least a dozen food-related complaints from advocacy groups and lawyers representing detainees across the country, according to Dojaquez-Torres.",
      "\u201cThe common complaint is that there is just not enough food,\u201d she said in an interview. \u201cWhat I am hearing is that there are extended periods of time when people are not being fed, and when they are, they are being given chips or a slice of bread.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have been getting reports from around the country from our members ... and conditions have been declining rapidly,\u201d she said. She also said that some detainees haven\u2019t been given beds and that some have said they aren\u2019t given access to showers.",
      "In early June, a \u201cmelee\u201d broke out in Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey, because of conditions inside the facility, which included \u201cpaltry meals served at irregular hours,\u201d according to The New York Times, which spoke to several lawyers representing detainees inside the facility and family members.",
      "Geo Group pushed back against the Times\u2019 reporting in an emailed statement at the time, saying, \u201cContrary to current reporting, there has been no widespread unrest at the facility.\u201d",
      "DHS also denied allegations of food issues at the Newark immigration detention facility when NBC News asked about them.",
      "\u201cAllegations that there are chronic food shortages at Delaney Hall are unequivocally false. The facility regularly reviews any detainee complaints. The Food Service Operations Director conducted a review of food portions and detainees are being fed the portions as prescribed by the nutritionist, based on a daily 2400 to 2600 caloric intake,\u201d McLaughlin said.",
      "DHS didn\u2019t respond to a follow-up question about how recently the food service operations director \u2014 or any oversight body reviewing food in ICE detention facilities nationwide \u2014 had last visited and made an assessment.",
      "In late May, Rubimar said, her husband, Jose, had called and told her that the gas at his facility wasn\u2019t functioning and that they had been given only a bag of tuna to eat in the meantime. But even before that, she said, her husband said the food was \u201ctoo little.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin said a dietitian had recently approved the meal plan at the El Paso Service Processing Center and indicated \u201cthe total caloric intake for ICE detainees at the facility was 3,436 per day \u2014 which exceeds the average daily recommended minimums.\u201d",
      "LaSalle Corrections, which operates the Winn Correctional Center, didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.",
      "The GEO Group, which operates the ICE facilities in Newark and Tacoma, as well as the Golden State Annex and many others nationwide, didn\u2019t respond to specific allegations about food service and instead provided this statement: \u201cWe are proud of the role our company has played for 40 years to support the law enforcement mission of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Over the last four decades, our innovative support service solutions have helped the federal government implement the policies of seven different Presidential Administrations. In all instances, our support services are monitored by ICE, including on-site agency personnel, and other organizations within the Department of Homeland Security to ensure strict compliance with ICE detention standards.\u201d",
      "Reduced oversight",
      "Beyond overcrowding, immigration advocates also blame the alleged food issues at detention facilities in part on cutbacks to a team of inspectors inside DHS.",
      "The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, an office that previously oversaw conditions inside ICE and ICE-contracted facilities, was entirely or mainly shuttered this year after the \u201cmajority of the workforce\u201d was issued reduction-in-force notices, according to ongoing litigation regarding the cuts.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that made the [Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman] is that we actually had case managers in the facilities and they were accessible to the detainees,\u201d a former DHS employee who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of concerns about future government employment. \u201cThey would actually go into the kitchen [to see] if there were deficiencies and work with kitchen management.\u201d",
      "Karla Gilbride, a lawyer with Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group suing the Trump administration over the firings of people in the office, said the office has been completely dismantled.",
      "\u201cThat is our position, that they have shut down the office. They put everyone on leave. They were told to stop interacting with everyone who filed complaints\u201d from detention, Gilbride said.",
      "The former DHS employee said the dismantling of the ombudsman\u2019s office means detainees have fewer options if they have complaints or concerns about things like food, overcrowding, sanitation, access to legal counsel and clean clothes.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, it really just means that there are less people to sound an alarm,\u201d the former DHS employee said.",
      "McLaughlin didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment about the dismantling of the ombudsman\u2019s office. DHS has maintained in court filings that the ombudsman\u2019s office remains open and that efforts to restaff certain positions affected by the layoffs are underway.",
      "In a status report filed in court in early July, government lawyers said they are onboarding three new employees at the ombudsman\u2019s office and that files have been created for all new complaints since the end of March."

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\u201d Trump said in response to a reporter\u2019s question at the Group of Seven summit the same day. \u201cLet him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\u201d",
      "In the course of a few weeks, Trump has faced a surprising level of pushback from prominent supporters as he moved to strike nuclear facilities in Iran, floated a new policy to allow undocumented farmworkers to remain in the United States and castigated allies for demanding more information related to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Even in that environment, Carlson, regarded as a MAGA standard-bearer, stood out.",
      "\u201cI like Trump. I campaigned for Trump,\u201d Carlson said in an interview, adding: \u201cBut I\u2019ve got my views. I assume that we will overlap on most things, and I hope that, by the way, the bombing of the nuclear sites in Iran, which I did not support, I hope it works out great, and I\u2019ll be grateful if it does. And I\u2019ll be the first to say I was wrong for the millionth time in my life.\u201d",
      "In June, Carlson said Trump was \u201ccomplicit in the act of war\u201d as Israel launched attacks on Iran. (Trump later said Carlson \u201ccalled and apologized.\u201d) One month before, Carlson echoed concerns about Trump\u2019s business dealings in the Middle East, saying \u201cit seems like corruption\u201d when Shawn Ryan, a guest on his program, raised alarm about new Trump properties in the region. And now, he is taking the administration to task for declining to release additional information about Epstein, with whom Trump had a yearslong friendship before a falling-out.",
      "\u201cThe fact that the U.S. government, the one that I voted for, refused to take my question seriously and instead said, \u2018Case closed, shut up conspiracy theorist,\u2019 was too much for me,\u201d Carlson said Friday at the Turning Point USA Student Action Summit, where he devoted his speech to the issue. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the rest of us should be satisfied with that.\u201d",
      "Carlson emphasized his personal admiration for Trump but took issue with his response to the furor over the Epstein files. At a Cabinet meeting last week, Trump brushed off growing discontent and said it was \u201ca desecration\u201d to ask about Epstein after flooding in Texas killed dozens.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not adequate to say anyone who asked [questions] is somehow desecrating the memory of little girls who died in Texas,\u201d Carlson said in his speech Friday, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t care who gives that answer. That is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "Carlson\u2019s frustrations represent broader discontent in MAGA world with the policies of the man who brought them together. It\u2019s a key moment for the movement, which for the past decade has been largely in lockstep, testing whether it\u2019s willing to truly break with Trump and whether anyone besides Trump can shape its direction.",
      "\u2018I was never an important adviser to Trump\u2019",
      "Asked about his direct discussions with Trump, Carlson said he \u201ccertainly had a lot of conversations with him,\u201d though he declined to say when the two men last spoke.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not a policymaker,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just a guy with opinions. I don\u2019t work there. I\u2019ve never worked in any government. I\u2019ve never taken any money from any politician or any government, and I just have strong views, which, by the way, are sometimes wrong, really wrong. I supported the Iraq War. So my track record is spotty.\u201d",
      "And Carlson said he was unaware whether his influence in the White House has waned in light of his recent commentary.",
      "\u201cI was never an important adviser to Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was always kind of overstated.\u201d",
      "Carlson was center stage among MAGA influencers arguing for the United States to stay out of Iran, a position that has gained popularity on the right as some right-wing influencers have increasingly viewed the U.S.-Israel alliance with skepticism. That stance is also informed by Trump\u2019s having promoted similar anti-war and anti-interventionist views for years, even as he has used military force as president. Ultimately, Carlson said, the most important voice arguing the case to Trump for the U.S. bombing of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.",
      "\u201cTurns out a head of state of an important ally has a more compelling message than I do,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems reasonable to me. I still disagree, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like Trump has changed his views entirely.\u201d",
      "Some around Trump have taken a victory lap given that he ultimately didn\u2019t ally with Carlson on military action in Iran.",
      "\u201cThe Iran operation was both a shot at the Iranians, but it was also a shot at the restrainers of the administration and at Tucker and everyone else who said the president is never going to do this,\u201d a Trump ally close to the administration said. \u201cThey think he\u2019s an ideologue like they are, and he isn\u2019t. These guys overplayed their hands.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s relationship with Carlson has had peaks and valleys dating to his first administration. Most notably, during Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 2023 court battle against Fox News, the judge made public text messages showing Carlson\u2019s trashing Trump amid his effort to overturn his 2020 loss, in which he privately said, \u201cI hate him passionately.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s never been a natural ally of the president,\u201d a second Trump ally said, pointing to the texts.",
      "But the two reconciled during Trump\u2019s third run for the White House as both were in exile: Carlson having been ousted from Fox News as part of the fallout over the Dominion lawsuit and Trump facing multiple indictments, including in connection with his role in trying to reverse his 2020 defeat.",
      "When Carlson was forced out of his show in 2023, Trump said he was \u201cshocked,\u201d adding, \u201cHe\u2019s a very good person and a very good man and very talented, as you know, and he had very high ratings.\u201d The strengthening of their relationship led Carlson to campaign for Trump, including in a prime-time speaking slot at last summer\u2019s Republican convention.",
      "Given Carlson\u2019s stature in the MAGA movement, prominent Trump allies have come to his defense. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., said last month that Carlson \u201cis one of my favorite people.\u201d Arguing against intervention in Iran, she added, was \u201cnot kooky.\u201d",
      "Steve Bannon, the former White House aide and MAGA media personality, who occupies a perch similar to Carlson\u2019s, said the brouhaha between the two men comes during \u201ca time of turmoil\u201d when Trump is handling a number of crises at once. He said Carlson is \u201cstill one of the leaders of our movement and an incredibly strong, independent voice.\u201d",
      "\u201cTucker has always worked at this a little more with a jaundiced eye,\u201d Bannon said. \u201cHe came to this movement late. He waited and measured it. He respects President Trump; he supported President Trump. When Tucker took on the ruling class, it was a seminal moment for MAGA \u2014 because he did it on Fox prime time. Since then, Tucker has been there for \u2018America First,\u2019 especially when it mattered most.\u201d",
      "More broadly, Bannon said, MAGA influencers and thought leaders have to call out policy decisions that veer from base expectations in hope of ensuring their perspective is represented.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to represent every day and continue to make sure that people understand, particularly people around President Trump, and sometimes even the president himself, understands where we think core values lie,\u201d Bannon said.",
      "\u2018A dissident figure\u2019",
      "It\u2019s not as if Carlson hadn\u2019t publicly criticized Trump or his administration before. He similarly sounded the alarm in 2020 when the United States killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and he criticized Trump\u2019s handling of national protests after Minneapolis police murdered George Floyd later that year. While such pushback isn\u2019t new, a person close to Carlson said he has never crossed the line into all-consuming criticism like Matt Drudge or Ann Coulter, other conservative media personalities who have sharply broken with Trump.",
      "\u201cTucker\u2019s not being malicious towards the president at all,\u201d a source close to the White House said. \u201cYou can very easily still support somebody and disagree with a specific policy decision. Agree with him or disagree with him, Tucker is at least coming from a sincere place of love and concern for the president. He just wants the president to be successful and is worried that issues like amnesty, Epstein, Ukraine funding and war in the Middle East could eventually lead to his presidency being derailed.\u201d",
      "Trump maintains high approval ratings with the Republican base, which is informing how he and the White House view the pushback online. An Economist/YouGov survey published Tuesday found that 87% of Republicans approve of Trump\u2019s handling of his job so far.",
      "\u201cThe president cares deeply about the MAGA base; he is very responsive to them,\u201d a person familiar with the White House\u2019s thinking said.",
      "This person pointed to online chatter last week about whether Trump would offer some sort of \u201camnesty\u201d after he talked up an effort at a rally to allow undocumented farmworkers to stay in the country, noting that at a Cabinet meeting, Trump was responsive to the concerns and said there would be \u201cno amnesty.\u201d",
      "\u201cThings like that are notable when thinking about how the president balances the viewpoints he\u2019s getting,\u201d the person added. \u201cAnd a lot of what he\u2019s done recently are direct responses to so many of the campaign promises made to the base.\u201d",
      "A MAGA thought leader described Trump and Carlson as \u201ctwo of the great minds of MAGA,\u201d saying the movement wouldn\u2019t exist in its current form without either one. This person worried the MAGA perspective was \u201cgetting a little squeezed out of the inner circle\u201d at the White House on several issues of note.",
      "\u201cPeople are not going to go along with endless war,\u201d this person said. \u201cAnd when they see the capitulation on Epstein, it just hurts. The Trump administration made overtures that they were serious about this. But six months in and kind of trying to tie a bow around it, it\u2019s just not satisfying. That\u2019s not going to sit well.\u201d",
      "No other issue has tested the MAGA base\u2019s commitment to Trump like the Epstein files.",
      "For years, many on the right \u2014 including some people who are now in the Trump administration \u2014 have called for the release of all government documents related to Epstein. Epstein died in custody in 2019, and a medical examiner ruled his death a suicide. He was facing sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "Last week, Attorney General Pam Bondi released a memo saying the Justice Department\u2019s review turned up no \u201cclient list\u201d of powerful men alleged to have participated in Epstein\u2019s schemes, enraging the MAGA base, who are calling on her to be fired. Trump\u2019s defense of Bondi and his attempts to tell his supporters to move on from the issue have done little to quell the furor.",
      "On Saturday, Trump wrote \u201cLET PAM BONDI DO HER JOB \u2014 SHE\u2019S GREAT!\u201d on Truth Social, adding the United States should \u201cnot waste Time and Energy on Jeffrey Epstein, somebody that nobody cares about.\u201d",
      "In his NBC News interview, Carlson said he now believes the Justice Department actually doesn\u2019t have \u201cmuch relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than just admit that, Pam Bondi made a bunch of ludicrous claims on cable news shows that she couldn\u2019t back up, and this current outrage is the result,\u201d he said.",
      "A Republican Senate aide thinks Carlson is actually having a bit of a \u201crevival\u201d as he carves out distinct space on the right.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s more of a dissident figure now,\u201d this person said. \u201cFor whatever else you\u2019re going to say, Tucker is just kind of saying what he thinks.\u201d",
      "No recent moment generated more buzz for Carlson than his contentious and combative interview with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, which put the MAGA divide over the conflict between Israel and Iran on full display. Even with the administration not siding with him, Carlson said he\u2019s \u201creally grateful\u201d that there\u2019s significant debate on the right over a litany of policy issues.",
      "As for his assessment of the first six months of Trump\u2019s second presidency, he said, \u201cI think they\u2019re trying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe most important thing, not just for Republicans, not even for all the first-time Republican voters who supported Trump, but just for the country,\u201d Carlson said, \u201cis to make it clear that you\u2019re trying to achieve what you said you would achieve.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s hot election summer \u2014 at least according to young Democrats who are organizing behind youthful and progressive candidates in a series of off-year, summertime primaries.",
      "First was Zohran Mamdani, the 33-year-old state legislator who won New York\u2019s Democratic mayoral primary over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Now, a special election for a vacant congressional seat in southern Arizona is grabbing attention in part because of a young Democrat\u2019s campaign.",
      "After Rep. Ra\u00fal Grijalva died in March at 77, Deja Foxx, 25, is gaining ground in the special Democratic primary in Arizona\u2019s 7th District, running on a message of generational change and hoping to leverage support from her almost 400,000 TikTok followers and 240,000 Instagram followers to win. But she doesn\u2019t have a clear path against former Pima County Supervisor Adelita Grijalva, the late congressman\u2019s daughter, and former state Rep. Daniel Hernandez.",
      "Grijalva, in particular, with her endorsements from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., doesn\u2019t give Foxx the same ideological opening that Mamdani exploited in New York. Not only did Grijalva\u2019s father serve the district in Congress for over 20 years, but Hernandez also has siblings who serve in the state House.",
      "Still, the race has become part of a broader nationwide conversation among Democrats about the ages of their party\u2019s elected leaders and the desire for generational change.",
      "\u2018We need to give young people real leadership\u2019",
      "In an interview last week, Foxx acknowledged that her age has played a role in her campaign messaging and the support she has drawn from young people across the country.",
      "\u201cWe have lost ground with young people as a party for the first time in decades ... and it\u2019s not enough to just put our members of Congress on TikTok, right, or brief them on the trends or put mini-mics in their face. We need to give young people real leadership,\u201d Foxx said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the thing that people in this party say in every stump speech. They say we need newer and younger leaders, a new generation of leadership \u2014 and yet, when an open seat comes up and newer and younger comes around with a decade of advocacy experience and progressive policies, we\u2019ve seen people put their thumb on the scale and pick the more predictable option,\u201d she added.",
      "Age has been a selling point for Foxx with little daylight between her and Grijalva on the issues. Both identify as progressive, and Arizona\u2019s 7th District is heavily Democratic. Whoever wins the Democratic primary Tuesday is likely to win September\u2019s general special election to represent a stretch from Tucson south to the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "But Grijalva emphasized in an interview this month that experience should matter more than age, dismissing suggestions that she is too old for the job at 54 \u2014 which makes her younger than more than half the voting members in the House, according to analysis by the Pew Research Center.",
      "\u201cRespectfully, I\u2019m not old,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to me how experience is being seen as a negative,\u201d she said later in the interview, going on to add: \u201cI\u2019m a little surprised that in a Democratic primary, in a party that really should be working to inform people and not spread misinformation \u2014 that was not something that I was prepared for.\u201d",
      "Grijalva\u2019s experience has paid off in the form of connections local and national. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, she has also racked up support from Arizona\u2019s Democratic senators, Ruben Gallego and Mark Kelly; former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and her pro-gun control group, Giffords PAC; and EMILY\u2019s List and the League of Conservation Voters.",
      "\u201cThis race, the people that have decided to be supportive and endorse \u2014 those are endorsements that I have earned,\u201d Grijalva said.",
      "Foxx has won support from former Democratic National Committee vice chair David Hogg and his group pushing generational change in Democratic primaries, Leaders We Deserve. She didn\u2019t directly address the national figures who have endorsed Grijalva, but she pointed to Grijalva\u2019s late father\u2019s longtime presence in Washington as a reason for the support.",
      "\u201cThe 7th Congressional District is one of the youngest districts in Arizona. It\u2019s also largely working-class,\u201d Foxx said. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that there\u2019s people in this race who have advantages that people like us would never have.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unfair or even antagonistic to point out the advantages that one candidate might have over another in this race, especially inherited advantages,\u201d she added.",
      "Grijalva pushed back against Foxx\u2019s criticisms, saying her position \u201cis making it appear as if I\u2019m part of some establishment, when the national Democratic Party has not helped me in this race.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not like the Bushes or the Rockefellers,\u201d she said. \u201cI literally live on the south side of town and have lived there my whole life.\u201d",
      "Hernandez, 35, didn\u2019t mention Grijalva by name but said he has been hearing from voters that they favor electing a new generation of leadership.",
      "\u201cRecently, people are talking more and more that they want a new type of leadership. What we saw that happened in New York was not necessarily an ideological fight but more so a generational and a fight around the establishment,\u201d Hernandez said in an interview last week. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s been a lot of concerns around, you know, \u2018are the people who we\u2019ve had in power, who have gotten us into this mess, the same ones that we trust to be able to get us out?\u2019\u201d",
      "Hernandez, who has been the top fundraiser in the race, said the No. 1 issue he has heard about from voters in the district is affordability \u2014 one of the main points Mamdani seized on so effectively in his campaign in New York, with some of his supporters feeling other Democratic candidates weren\u2019t focused enough on the issue.",
      "\u201cThe biggest things that keep coming up are the same things that came up back in March when I launched my campaign, which was what are you going to do to try and lower cost of living, and what are you going to do to protect Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d he said.",
      "A debate over \u2018experience\u2019",
      "Kyle Nitschke, 28, who runs the Arizona Students\u2019 Association, an organization with a strong presence on college campuses throughout the state, said, \u201cOne big difference between the New York City race and this race is that Deja doesn\u2019t have a Cuomo to go against and attack.\u201d Nitschke noted Cuomo\u2019s resignation as governor of New York in 2021 after having faced allegations of sexual harassment.",
      "Nitschke believes Foxx\u2019s description of Grijalva as an \u201cestablishment\u201d figure isn\u2019t resonating with young voters in the district. \u201cI wish they were attacking each other a little less about not being progressives, because they\u2019re both awesome, great progressive candidates,\u201d Nitschke said.",
      "Grijalva\u2019s name has long carried the weight of her late father\u2019s legacy, but it has been bolstered by her own experience in the state, including time on the Pima County Board of Supervisors and the Tucson Unified School District Governing Board.",
      "\u201cShe is not seen as someone who is just carrying a name in name only. She\u2019s seen as someone who\u2019s acting in her father\u2019s footsteps, as well,\u201d said Dawn Penich, an Arizona Democratic political consultant.",
      "Grijalva said, \u201cMy dad left huge shoes to fill, but I stand on my own two feet, and I have more than two decades of public service in Arizona, and that is not, that is not a politician, it\u2019s a public servant.\u201d",
      "Foxx, less than half Grijalva\u2019s age, has had a much shorter time in the political limelight. She was a vocal advocate for abortion rights in the 2024 presidential election cycle, when Arizonans approved an amendment enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution. She hosted community events with celebrities like Jodie Foster and Chrissy Teigen to spread awareness about the initiative, which introduced her to much of the state.",
      "Now, Foxx has leaned heavily on social media to supercharge her campaign.",
      "Nitschke said that \u201cliterally any time I\u2019m scrolling through my Instagram stories,\u201d he\u2019ll see Foxx\u2019s content.",
      "Penich said Foxx\u2019s strategy could pay dividends in future elections even if it doesn\u2019t this year.",
      "\u201cThe base that she\u2019s building and the people she\u2019s having that organic connection with are probably closer to her generation and her age group than where the majority of the voting population is,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cFor all the folks, myself included, saying, \u2018Deja is an impressive woman, but this is not her race, this is not her time\u2019... she put herself on a lot of people\u2019s radars, she has shown she can be a powerful presence,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cSometimes you lose a race, but you\u2019ve gained so much footing for the next thing you want to do.\u201d"

      "Clashes between local militias and clans in Syria\u2019s Sweida province have killed more than 30 people and injured nearly 100, and government forces were being sent to the area to restore order, authorities said.",
      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at least 37 people killed, including two children, in the clashes between armed groups from the Druze religious minority and Sunni Bedouin clans around the province. The U.K.-based war monitor reported that military convoys were sent to the area to reinforce security checkpoints.",
      "The observatory said the clashes had started after a series of kidnappings between both groups, which began when members of a Bedouin tribe in the area set up a checkpoint where they attacked and robbed a young Druze man.",
      "Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the observatory, said the conflict started with the kidnapping and robbery of a Druze vegetable seller, leading to tit-for-tat attacks and kidnappings.",
      "Syria\u2019s defense and interior ministries were deploying personnel to the area to attempt to restore order.",
      "The interior ministry in a statement called the situation a dangerous escalation that \u201ccomes in the absence of the relevant official institutions, which has led to an exacerbation of the state of chaos, the deterioration of the security situation, and the inability of the local community to contain the situation despite repeated calls for calm.\u201d",
      "Factions from the Druze minority have been suspicious of the new authorities in Damascus after former President Bashar Assad fell in a lightning rebel offensive led by Sunni Islamist insurgent groups in December. Earlier this year, Druze groups in Sweida clashed with security forces from the new government.",
      "The Druze religious sect is a minority group that began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. In Syria, they largely live in the southern Sweida province and some suburbs of Damascus, mainly in Jaramana and Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to the south.",
      "The Druze developed their own militias during the country\u2019s nearly 14-year civil war. Since Assad\u2019s fall, different Druze factions have been at odds over whether to integrate with the new government and armed forces."

      "PRAIRIE ISLAND INDIAN COMMUNITY, Minn. \u2014 Some Native Americans traditionally bestow bald eagle feathers at ceremonies to mark achievements, such as graduations, and as a form of reverence for the bird they hold sacred as a messenger to the Creator.",
      "This year, many are doing so with elevated pride and hope. The bald eagle is now the official bird of the United States, nearly 250 years after it was first used as a symbol of the newly founded nation that\u2019s deeply polarized politically today.",
      "\u201cThe eagle is finally getting the respect it deserves. Maybe when the nation looks at the eagle that way, maybe there will be less division,\u201d said Jim Thunder Hawk. He\u2019s the Dakota culture and language manager for the Prairie Island Indian Community, a small Mdewakanton Sioux band on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota.",
      "This wide, unruffled stretch of water framed by wooded bluffs is prime bald eagle territory. The size of Minnesota\u2019s population of the majestic, white-head-and-tail birds that are exclusive to North America is second only to that of Alaska.",
      "The legislation that made the eagle official came from members of Minnesota\u2019s Congressional delegation. The federal act recognizes the eagles\u2019 centrality in most Indigenous peoples\u2019 \u201cspiritual lives and sacred belief systems,\u201d and a replica of it is on display at the National Eagle Center in Wabasha, Minnesota, 40 miles downriver from the Prairie Island community, which partners with the center in eagle care.",
      "\u201cIf you grew up in the United States, eagles were a part of your everyday life,\u201d said Tiffany Ploehn, who as the center\u2019s avian care director supervises its four resident bald eagles. \u201cEveryone has some sort of connection.\u201d",
      "Fierce symbols of strength and spiritual uplift",
      "A bald eagle, its wings and talons spread wide, has graced the Great Seal of the United States since 1782, and appears on passport covers, the $1 bill, military insignia, and myriad different images in pop culture.",
      "But a prolific collector of eagle memorabilia based in Wabasha realized recently that, while the United States had an official animal (the bison) and flower (the rose), the eagle was getting no formal credit. Several Minnesota legislators sponsored a bill to remedy that and then-President Joe Biden\u2019s signature made it official in December.",
      "With their massive wingspan and stern curved beak, bald eagles are widely used as symbols of strength and power. In reality, they spend 95% of their day perched high in trees, though when they hunt they can spot a rabbit 3 miles (5 kilometers) away, Ploehn said.",
      "For many Native Americans, the soaring eagle represents far more; it delivers their prayers to the Creator and even intercedes on their behalf.",
      "\u201cMy grandma told me that we honor eagles because they saved the Ojibwe people when the Creator wanted to turn on them. The eagle, he can fly high, so he went to speak with the Creator to make things right,\u201d said Sadie Erickson, who is Ojibwe and Mdewakanton Sioux.",
      "Marking life milestones with eagle feathers",
      "Erickson and a dozen other high school graduates received a bald eagle feather at an early July celebration by the riverbank at Prairie Island.",
      "Thunder Hawk said a prayer in the Dakota language urging the high school graduates and graduates receiving higher education degrees to \u201calways remember who you are and where you come from.\u201d",
      "Then they lined up and a relative tied a feather \u2014 traditionally on the left side, the heart\u2019s side \u2014 as tribal members sang and drummed to celebrate them.",
      "\u201cIt just feels like I went through a new step of life,\u201d said Jayvionna Buck.",
      "Growing up on Prairie Island, she recalled her mother excitedly pointing out every eagle.",
      "\u201cShe would genuinely just yell at me, \u2018Eagle!\u2019 But it\u2019s just a special occurrence for us to see,\u201d Buck said. \u201cWe love seeing it, and normally when we do, we just offer tobacco to show our respects.\u201d",
      "Some Native Americans honor the eagle by taking it as their ceremonial name. Derek Walking Eagle, whose Lakota name is \u201cEagle Thunder,\u201d celebrated the graduates wearing a woven medallion representing the bird.",
      "To him, eagles are like relatives that connect him to his future and afterlife.",
      "\u201cBeing able to carry on to the spirit world \u2026 that\u2019s who guides you. It\u2019s the eagle,\u201d Walking Eagle said.",
      "That deep respect attaches to the feathers, too.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the highest respect you can bestow on a person, from your family and from your people, from your tribe,\u201d Thunder Hawk said. \u201cWe teach the person receiving the feather that they have to honor and respect the eagle. And we tell them why.\u201d",
      "Persistent troubles, but new hope",
      "In many Native cultures, killing an eagle is \u201cblasphemous,\u201d he said. It is also a federal offense.",
      "Historically, Sioux warriors would lure an eagle with rabbit or other food, pluck a few feathers and release it, said Thunder Hawk, who grew up in South Dakota.",
      "Today, there\u2019s a nationwide program that legally distributes eagle feathers and parts exclusively to tribal members, though it\u2019s very backlogged. U.S. wildlife and tribal officials worry that killings and illegal trafficking of eagles for their feathers is on the rise, especially in the West.",
      "In Minnesota, eagles are most often harmed by road accidents and eating poison \u2014 results of shrinking wildlife habitat that brings them in closer contact with humans, said Lori Arent, interim director of the University of Minnesota\u2019s Raptor Center.",
      "The center treats about 200 injured bald eagles each year. Of those they can save, most are eventually released back into the wild. Permanently disabled birds that lose an eye or whose wings are too badly fractured to fly are cared for there or at other educational institutions like the Wabasha eagle center.",
      "The official designation could help more Americans understand how their behaviors inadvertently harm eagles, Arent said. Littering by a highway, for instance, attracts rodents that lure eagles, which then can be struck by vehicles. Fishing or hunting with tackles and ammunition containing lead exposes the eagles eating those fish or deer remains to fatal metal poisoning.",
      "Humans have lost the ability to coexist in harmony with the natural world, Thunder Hawk said, voicing a concern shared by Indigenous people from the Chilean Andes to the U.S.-Mexico borderlands.",
      "He hopes more people might now approach the eagle with the same reverence he was taught. It\u2019s what leads him to offer sage or dried red willow bark every time he spots one as a \u201cthank you for allowing me to see you and for you to hear my prayers and my thoughts.\u201d",
      "Erickson, the new graduate, shares that optimism.",
      "\u201cI feel like that kind of shows that we\u2019re strong and united as a country,\u201d she said by the Mississippi, her new feather nestled in her hair."

    "story": [
      "The number of young children sickened after getting their little hands on nicotine products like pouches and vape e-liquids has skyrocketed in recent years.",
      "From 2010 through 2023, U.S. poison centers reported 134,663 cases of nicotine poisonings among kids under age 6, according to a study published Monday in Pediatrics, a journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Nearly all occurred at home.",
      "The cases included exposures to nicotine pouches, chewing tobacco, regular cigarettes, vapes and nicotine replacement products like gum and lozenges.",
      "But it\u2019s nicotine pouches, like the wildly popular Zyn, that are behind the most significant rise in accidental nicotine poisonings among young kids.",
      "The new research found that the rate of poisonings involving nicotine pouches among kids under 6 rose from 0.48 per 100,000 children in 2020 to 4.14 per 100,000 in 2023.",
      "That\u2019s an increase of 763% in just three years \u2014 a startling finding that correlates with a surge in sales of nicotine pouches.",
      "Nicotine pouches \u2014 which users tuck between their lip and gum and later discard \u2014 can contain as much as 6 milligrams of nicotine, a stimulant, and have been promoted as tobacco-free, spit-free and hands-free alternatives to cigarettes and chewing tobacco.",
      "They are not, however, approved by the Food and Drug Administration as nicotine replacement products used to help quit smoking.",
      "A 2021 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Office on Smoking and Health (one of several public health groups dismantled under the Trump administration) found that sales of nicotine pouches rose dramatically in the past decade, from $709,000 in 2016 to $216 million by mid-2020.",
      "\u201cIt was just a matter of time before they fell into the hands of younger kids,\u201d said Dr. Molly O\u2019Shea, a Michigan pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics. \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but not shocking.\u201d",
      "Why is nicotine toxic to little kids?",
      "Nicotine is a chemical that\u2019s highly toxic and could easily exceed a fatal dose in small children, according to a 2013 study.",
      "The chemical increases heart rate and blood pressure, and could lead to nausea, vomiting or even coma, the study authors wrote.",
      "Most cases included in the new research weren\u2019t serious enough to warrant medical attention. But 39 children had significant side effects, like trouble breathing and seizures, said Natalie Rine, an author of the new study and director of the Central Ohio Poison Center at Nationwide Children\u2019s Hospital in Columbus.",
      "Most nicotine poisoning cases, 76%, were babies and toddlers under age 2.",
      "Two children, a 1-year-old boy and another boy about a year and a half old, died after ingesting liquid nicotine used in vapes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good that the majority of kids in the study actually did pretty well. Most kids had either minor symptoms or no symptoms and didn\u2019t require any medical management,\u201d Rine said. \u201cBut two deaths is a lot, especially for something considered a preventable death.\u201d",
      "How to reduce nicotine poisonings in kids",
      "Kids are curious by nature. Babies and toddlers in particular explore their worlds by putting things in their mouth.",
      "And they\u2019re masters at breaking into drawers and cabinets to find new \u201ctoys.\u201d Canisters of nicotine pouches are not equipped with child-resistant packaging. They taste good, too. Mint and fruit flavors are almost always added.",
      "O\u2019Shea said it\u2019s critical that all nicotine products are placed far out of reach of children. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean in your purse, in your back pocket or on the counter,\u201d she said. \u201cIt means locked away.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s not just parents and other adult caregivers who must be mindful of their nicotine products. An April study from the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California found the use of nicotine pouches among high school students nearly doubled between 2023 and 2024.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy for a teenager to be using this product and have parents be unaware,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cIt\u2019s important for parents to be talking with their teenagers about products like this and having open dialogue in a nonjudgmental way in order to ascertain any risk.\u201d",
      "Rine also recommends adding the national poison control number to cellphones: 1-800-222-1222."

    "story": [
      "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. \u2014 A fast-moving wildfire destroyed a historic lodge and dozens of other structures on the Grand Canyon\u2019s North Rim, forcing officials to close access to that area for the season, the park said Sunday.",
      "The Grand Canyon Lodge, the only lodging inside the park at the North Rim, was consumed by the flames, park Superintendent Ed Keable told park residents, staff and others in a meeting Sunday morning. He said the visitor center, the gas station, a wastewater treatment plant, an administrative building and some employee housing were among the 50 to 80 structures lost. \u201cNumerous\u201d historic cabins in the area also were destroyed, the park said.",
      "Two wildfires are burning at or near the North Rim, known as the White Sage Fire and the Dragon Bravo Fire. The latter is the one that impacted the lodge and other structures.",
      "Started by lightning on July 4, the Dragon Bravo Fire was initially managed by authorities with a \u201cconfine and contain\u201d strategy to clear fuel sources. They shifted to aggressive suppression a week later as it rapidly grew to 7.8 square miles because of hot temperatures, low humidity and strong wind gusts, fire officials said.",
      "The White Sage Fire doubled in size on Sunday, growing from roughly 20,000 acres to 40,000, according to government website that tracks U.S. fires.",
      "No injuries have been reported.",
      "Millions of people visit Grand Canyon National Park annually, with most going to the more popular South Rim. The North Rim is open seasonally. It was evacuated last Thursday because of wildfire, and will remain closed for the rest of the season, the park said in a statement.",
      "Firefighters at the North Rim and hikers in the inner canyon were evacuated over the weekend. The park said along with the fire risk, they could potentially be exposed to chlorine gas after the treatment plant burned. Chlorine gas is heavier than air and can lead to blurred vision, irritation or respiratory problems if high amounts of it are breathed in, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Rafters on the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon also were told to bypass Phantom Ranch, which has a set of cabins and dormitories along the river.",
      "The Grand Canyon Lodge was often the first prominent feature that visitors saw, even before viewing the canyon A highway ends at the lodge, which was known for its sloped roof, huge ponderosa beams and massive limestone facade. By walking across the lobby and descending a stairwell, visitors could get their first view of the Grand Canyon shining through windows across the \"Sun Room.\"",
      "\u201cIt just feels like you\u2019re a pioneer when you walk through there (the lodge),\u201d said Tim Allen, a longtime resident of Flagstaff, Arizona, and yearly visitor to the Grand Canyon. \u201cIt really felt like you were in a time gone by.\u201d",
      "Allen said the North Rim felt special and more personal because of its remoteness and reduced number of tourists. He often spent time there camping and doing rim-to-rim hikes, trekking all the way to the bottom of the canyon and back out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d he said of the destruction.",
      "Aramark, the company that operated the lodge, said all employees and guests were safely evacuated.",
      "\u201cAs stewards of some our country\u2019s most beloved national treasures, we are devastated by the loss,\u201d said spokesperson Debbie Albert.",
      "An original lodge burned down from a kitchen fire in 1932, four years after construction was completed, according to the Grand Canyon Historical Society. The redesigned lodge using the original stonework opened in 1937.",
      "Thomas Sulpizio, president of the historical society, said the lodge contained some valuable archives that he wasn\u2019t sure were saved.",
      "The lobby also contained a famous 600-pound bronze statue of a donkey named \u201cBrighty the Burro.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, officials reported progress in battling a second wildfire burning north of the Grand Canyon. Fire lines on the White Sage Fire that forced evacuations at the North Rim and in the community of Jacob Lake were holding, officials said. By Sunday afternoon the fire had charred 63 square miles of terrain.",
      "On the southern edge of the fire, hand crews and bulldozers were working uphill, and the spread of the blaze had been minimal.",
      "But to the east and north, the fire has spread rapidly, with grasses and standing dead trees contributing to the fire\u2019s intensity, officials said. The fire was pushing downhill toward the Vermilion Cliffs area, and crews were assessing opportunities to create buffer zones that help slow or halt the fire\u2019s progress.",
      "Wildfire closes national park in Colorado",
      "Elsewhere, one of several wildfires burning in Colorado that closed Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, about 260 miles southwest of Denver, has burned 5.6 square miles and forced the evacuation of homes near the park. The fire was started by lightning on Thursday on the south rim of the park, a dramatic, deep gorge carved by the Gunnison River.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis issued a disaster declaration on Sunday because of it and other fires burning in western Colorado. His office said they were all started the same day by the same storm.",
      "Another wildfire burning near the Colorado-Utah border near La Sal, Utah, also started Thursday and has burned around 14 square miles."

It\u2019s part entertainment, part science experiment, and entirely mesmerizing to watch.",
      "\u201cLove Island USA\u201d has also contributed its own unique blend of chaos with challenges like Season 7\u2019s \u201cStanding on Business\u201d challenge, where islanders could write anonymous or signed letters to air out their grievances with other contestants. Recipients had to read these brutal letters aloud to the entire group, creating intense confrontations that either cleared the air or set it completely ablaze.",

    "story": [
      "Taylor Williams and Clarke Carraway may have been voted out of the \"Love Island USA\" villa, but they say that hasn't impacted the status of their relationship.",
      "\"We're still the same as we were in the villa,\" Taylor tells TODAY.com. \"That's why I used the word exclusive instead of closed off. Closed off is a villa term. You're not in the outside world saying, 'We're closed off.'\"",
      "Before choosing to become exclusive in Episode 32, Taylor and Clarke met in Episode 19, when the girls on the show were sequestered in Casa Amor and five new female bombshells, including Clarke, entered the villa. While Clarke was initially coupled up with Taylor's friend Nic Vansteenberghe, during Episode 20's recoupling, Clarke and Taylor chose to give their connection a chance.",
      "Taylor tells TODAY.com he realized he was serious about exploring his relationship with Clarke by their second conversation.",
      "\"We had a conversation, and she pulled me to talk to me and was like, 'I want to let you know that I'm interested in you, that I like, you know, I want to get to know you,'\" Taylor recalls. \"And I was like, 'OK, cool, after we get ready.'",
      "\"And then we ended up talking like the rest of the morning. I was like, 'What the hell? I haven't gotten ready yet,'\" he adds.",
      "Clarke says after meeting Taylor, \"the conversation just flowed.\" She describes one moment when she, Taylor as well as Casa couple Ace Green and Courtney \u201cCoco\u201d Watson had a \"therapy session.\" During this exercise, Ace and Coco asked them about their connection and their plans for the future before swapping.",
      "\"That was fun, and then I was like, 'My feet hurt,' and then he took my shoes off for me,\" she adds with a laugh.",
      "What Happened Between Taylor and Olandria?",
      "Before Casa, Taylor had been coupled with Olandria Carthen since Day 1 in the villa. But while in Casa, she was temporarily voted off the show after she wasn't selected for a couple by the group of boy bombshells. At the same time, Nic was dumped from the villa.",
      "Or, so they thought.",
      "Episode 20 ended on a massive cliffhanger. As Nic left the villa, suitcase in hand, a black SUV pulled up, with Olandria inside. In the next episode, they were whisked off to a date and given the option to leave the show or couple up.",
      "At the same time as Nic and Olandria became the villa's newest couple, Taylor was pursuing his connection with Clarke. Taylor confirms Nic had expressed interest in Olandria before they were officially coupled up.",
      "\"He's always told me he's super attracted to her, but he never tried to explore it,\" Taylor says, citing Nic's first connection with Belle-A Walker, followed by Cierra Ortega. (Nic and Cierra chose to close off their relationship in Episode 25, then Cierra left the villa in Episode 30 after viewers resurfaced old posts in which she used racial slurs. Cierra apologized via a video she shared to social media July 9.)",
      "Taylor adds that Nic had a conversation with him about being coupled with Olandria.",
      "\"They came back, and we're sitting in the room. I was sitting next to him, and he asked me if I cared if he explored Olandria,\" Taylor says. \"I was like, 'No, go ahead. I can't get mad if you're exploring Olandria and I'm exploring Clarke.'\"",
      "When the girls came back from Casa, there was yet another recoupling, and Taylor had to choose between Olandria and Clarke. Taylor ended up choosing Clarke, citing the different feeling she gave him.",
      "Olandria was left single, before coupling up with Nic again in Episode 30 after Cierra left the villa. Clarke and Taylor meanwhile continued to grow their relationship, from having a picnic date to an energetic proposal for exclusivity.",
      "When asked for her favorite moment in the villa, Clarke makes Taylor guess.",
      "\"The cheer?\" Taylor says, as Clarke confirms with a laugh.",
      "In Episode 32, after the guys had a day of playing 3 v. 3 basketball, Taylor enlisted his fellow Islanders to help him ask Clarke to be exclusive via a cheer that involved spelling out her name. It started with Taylor opting to give that night's toast, and Clarke remembers thinking, \"I've never seen you do a toast, this is going to be fun.\"",
      "\"And then they start spelling everything out, and it gets to C-L, and I'm like, 'Oh my god, is this about to say my name right now?'\" Clarke says. \"I was just like speechless. I could not stop laughing. And they're doing cartwheels and flips ... I loved it.\"",
      "That night, the couple was dumped from the villa after receiving the fewest amount of fan votes. Taylor says he wasn't surprised. A viewer poll from Episode 27 consistently resulted in Clarke and Taylor coming last in categories like \"most genuine\" and \"best boyfriend material.\"",
      "\"Everything happens for a reason, so I can't be mad at it,\" he says. \"You know I could be upset, but it's like I can't be absolutely mad because this happened for a reason.\"",
      "But is there anything they would have done differently in the villa?",
      "\"Not for me,\" Clarke says.",
      "\"Yeah, no, I would have rocked out the same way I did, to be honest,\" Taylor agrees. \"I had a hell of a time in there. If I could do it again, I would do it the same way.\"",
      "What's Next for Clarke and Taylor?",
      "Taylor says their exclusive relationship is \"something that I see on the outside world and something that I want to keep growing on the outside world.\"",
      "But the two have quite the distance between them. Taylor is from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, while Clarke is from Charlotte, North Carolina.",
      "Clarke confirms they have plans to maintain a long-distance relationship.",
      "\"I'm going to go to Oklahoma and do the rodeo situation, and then he's going to come visit me in Charlotte,\" she says. \"Definitely, like a lot of traveling, but things to look forward to.\"",
      "Taylor says he's excited to introduce Clarke to \"rodeo world,\" \"horses\" and \"country life.\"",
      "Meanwhile Clarke says she wants to introduce Taylor to \"city life,\" such as \"fine dining.\"",

      "As of July 9, Amaya and Bryan seem to be making a genuine connection, even spending a night in the Hideaway after being nominated by their peer islanders. The couple officially made it to the July 13 finale after Episode 34.",
      "The nickname \"Amaya Papaya\" has been used online and on the show, including by \"Love Island USA\" host Ariana Madix and the Scorpio herself in a confessional.",
      "Why are people calling Amaya the \u2018People\u2019s Princess\u2019?",

      "After entering the villa, Amaya was met with immediate hostility because she kissed Jeremiah Brown without knowing he was exclusive with Huda Mustafa. Huda was upset, leaving Amaya on the defense.",
      "Her following connections left her confused and deflated.",
      "During her coupling with Ace, fans watched as Amaya\u2019s communication style conflicted with Ace\u2019s as he revealed his distaste for romantic nicknames and physical touch. This escalated to a blowout fight on the dock of the villa left both parties feeling unheard and frustrated.",
      "\u201cI know my worth plus the tax. I don\u2019t beg no man to see my value,\" Amaya told Ace.",
      "Then, during the postcards challenge, islanders wrote down anonymous complaints about each other and Amaya received many comments.",
      "Throughout a few episodes of difficult connections, fans caught smaller moments of Amaya's personality, including a photobooth strip of just herself when other islanders took photos in their couples.",
      "Despite the in-house drama, Amaya kept her head up and has been a positive light throughout the show. She\u2019s been emotional and resilient, taking care of herself first and foremost. Standout moments include the song she sang to herself while getting ready for the day and her mumu.",
      "What about her one-liners?",
      "Amaya is also known for her instantly quotable one-liners about everything from tea to confidence. Here are a few of the most memorable:",

      "The term tradwife, shortened from traditional wife, refers to a woman who follows traditional norms set by society. For many, a traditional wife involves getting married and having kids at a young age.",
      "This is the case for Smith, who married Lucky at 18 and had her first child at 19. Amid her growing popularity on social media for posting videos where she makes elaborate meals from scratch for her family while decked out in formal attire, Smith was labeled a tradwife by social media users. Some criticized Smith\u2019s decisions to follow a traditional path of life, including being a young mom and serving her husband as a traditional homemaker.",

      "Smith told Shetty that the traditional wife role never crossed her mind until she started posting content on her social media accounts, where she met many critics.",
      "\u201cI feel like they\u2019re projecting how they want their life onto me,\u201d Smith shared.",

      "\u201cI take this very serious,\u201d Smith told Shetty, recalling what she told her now husband.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s either gonna end in marriage or we\u2019re just gonna be done now, because I\u2019m not gonna invest my time in you if that\u2019s not the ultimate goal, and we were aligned,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cI\u2019ve always felt a little bit more mature for my age than a person at my age would be, and I always wanted different things in life than other people,\u201d Smith said.",
      "\u201cI always wanted to start a family, I wanted to have a slower life, I wanted to get married younger, I wanted to work and build something for my kids. My priorities were never in partying, or going out, or dating around, or going on fun vacations,\u201d she shared.",
      "Through all the criticism and online chatter about her life and decisions, Smith said that she\u2019ll continue to move forward with her style of content, regardless of the opinions of others.",
      "\u201cI feel like people see that side of my life, and I voice that side of my life, but they still don\u2019t want to accept it,\u201d Smith shared.",

      "The \"Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" star reveals that a sweet photograph placed right on Lois Lane\u2019s desk has a special meaning. It's a photo of  Jerry Siegel's wife, Joanne Siegel, who the actor says \u201cinspired the original Lois Lane.\u201d",
      "\"I didn\u2019t know that until they told me. You might catch a quick glimpse,\" Brosnahan explains.",
      "Joanne Siegel was the real-life model for Lois Lane. Her and Jerry Siegel's daughter, Laura Siegel Larson, told The New York Times in 2011 that her mom got the gig in the mid-1930s after she placed an ad in a newspaper. The first \u201cSuperman\u201d comic book was published in 1938.",
      "\u201cMy dad always said he wrote Lois with my mom\u2019s personality in mind,\u201d their daughter added.",

      "Beyond family references, David Corenswet, who plays Superman himself in the 2025 film, tells TODAY.com of other Easter eggs fans can expect to see in the movie.",
      "\u201cAll the street names in Metropolis are named after comic writers or artists, and all the newspapers have little Easter eggs,\u201d he teases. \u201cThere are business names that are from elsewhere in the comics. I think there are maybe some Peacemaker crossover references.\u201d",
      "Corenswet adds that director James Gunn \"loves Easter eggs like that,\" but that the audience finding them wasn't an expectation.",
      "\"He never wanted it to feel like you had to do homework in order to appreciate the movie,\" he says.",
      "However, Corenswet notes that they're extra fun bits for people who are really paying close attention."

      "Babies receiving critical care in Gaza risk becoming much sicker or even dying in the coming days as the enclave runs out of fuel and hospitals are forced to turn off incubators, doctors warn.",
      "Walking down a row of incubators in the neonatal unit of Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in southern Gaza, Dr. Ahmad Al-Farra, head of the facility's pediatric unit, shared each baby's story one by one.",
      "\"This baby is a full-term baby,\" he told NBC News' crew on the ground Thursday, gesturing at a tiny figure tucked into an incubator, wrapped in only his diaper and with an oxygen tube fixed to his nose with surgical tape.",
      "\"As you can see, he is depending on the mechanical ventilation,\" Al-Farra said. \"If the electricity was cut off ... this baby will not survive.\"",
      "His warning evokes memories of early on in the war, when a number of infants died at hospitals in northern Gaza after repeated warnings that a military assault in the area would end up being fatal for the babies.",
      "Nasser Hospital is just one of several facilities in Gaza facing \"imminent shutdown\" as fuel stocks in the enclave run out, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned Wednesday. The closure of vital units would most likely result in patients' deaths, including in the intensive care and neonatal units, it said.",
      "OCHA added that the \"total ban on fuel entry\" enforced by Israel for around 130 days was to blame for the shortages, which it said has also severely impacted water, sanitation and hygiene services.",
      "While Israel in May lifted a blockade that prevented the entry of food, medical supplies and other vital items, it has only allowed in a limited amount of aid, including \"basic\" food supplies.",
      "\"The real threat to babies in Gaza isn\u2019t a lack of fuel \u2014 it\u2019s Hamas,\"  David Mencer, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said in response to a request from NBC News for comment to the warnings of a fuel crisis at hospitals in the enclave.",
      "\"They hijack fuel for terror, not hospitals,\" he said.",
      "Mencer did not answer the question as to whether more fuel would be allowed to reach hospitals in Gaza in the near future.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military's liaison with the Palestinians, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Dr. Mohammad Saqer, director of nursing at Nasser Hospital, told NBC News that the facility only had around 3,000 liters (790 gallons) of diesel left. He said it needed 4,500 liters (1,190 gallons) daily to operate all departments effectively. Already, he said, the hospital had turned off electricity for some departments, funneling power to only the most vital units.",
      "\"The situation is very catastrophic because the electricity will abruptly go off within 24 hours,\" Saqer said. \"This means that a lot of patients, especially in the ICU in addition to other departments, are subject to inevitable death.\"",
      "Hospitals across the enclave have struggled to operate throughout the war, after being hit hard in Israel's offensive. Of the territory's 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 18 are providing partial services and 18 are not working at all, according to World Health Organization data last updated Monday.",
      "Saqer, meanwhile, called on the international community to step in and help get fuel to Gaza's hospitals in order to \"save the lives of the children.\"",
      "His call came as the European Union foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said in a post on X on Thursday that E.U. officials had reached a new deal with Israel to allow much-needed food and fuel into the enclave.",
      "Kallas said the deal could result in \u201cmore crossings open, aid and food trucks entering Gaza, repair of vital infrastructure and protection of aid workers.\"",
      "Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa'ar acknowledged the deal at a conference in Vienna, according to The Associated Press."

      "Among those killed were children as young as 1 and 4. Video verified by NBC News of the immediate aftermath of the strike in Deir al-Balah, in the central Gaza Strip, showed children slumped into pools of blood and women cradling limp toddlers. The area was shrouded in smoke and dust. Many people were screaming.",
      "\u201cProject HOPE\u2019s health clinics are a place of refuge in Gaza where people bring their small children, women access pregnancy and postpartum care, people receive treatment for malnutrition, and more,\u201d Rabih Torbay, the organization's president, said in a statement. \u201cYet, this morning, innocent families were mercilessly attacked as they stood in line waiting for the doors to open.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment by NBC News, the Israel Defense Forces said that the strike targeted a member of Hamas, and that it \u201cregrets any harm to uninvolved individuals.\u201d",
      "In one scene captured on video, several bloodied children, including a girl in a pale pink princess dress, along with her twin brother, were piled onto a donkey cart to be taken to Al-Aqsa Hospital.",
      "At the hospital, NBC News' team on the ground witnessed rituals of grief. A man kissed his small, dead nephew on the head. \u201cI love you so much, my love,\u201d he said, sobbing. A woman placed a glitter tulle clip into the wispy hair of the girl in the princess dress, her chubby face still smeared with blood. A mortuary technician tidied another girl's curls that were clumped by blood, the child still in her green T-shirt printed with a cartoon panda.",
      "Several people tended to an inconsolable woman and a man doubled over as he wept into the pavement. Another woman cried about the senselessness of the killings, \u201cWhat have those children done? What is the guilt of this child to die?\u201d They were starving and just trying to get formula at the clinic, she said.",
      "According to UNICEF, which issued a statement on the strike Thursday, the 1-year-old who was killed had just spoken his first word hours earlier. His mother was injured in the blast and now lies in a hospital bed, clutching her dead baby's shoe.",
      "\u201cNo parent should have to face such tragedy,\u201d UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in the statement. \u201cThis is the cruel reality confronting many in Gaza today after months of insufficient aid being allowed into the territory, and parties to the conflict failing to uphold basic responsibilities to protect civilians.\u201d",
      "She called on Israel to \u201curgently review its rules of engagement to ensure full compliance with international humanitarian law, notably the protection of civilians, including children.\u201d",
      "According to the local Health Ministry, 82 people were confirmed to have been killed in the last 24 hours, bringing the death toll to over 57,700 since October 2023, with more than 130,000 injured. More than 50,000 of those killed and injured have been children, Edouard Beigbeder, UNICEF\u2019s regional director for the Middle East and Africa, said in May.",
      "Dua al-Hazarin, a local journalist who captured the immediate aftermath of Thursday's strike on video, told NBC News that she had been on her way to an assignment when the attack \"happened right in front of me.\"",
      "\"Shrapnel was flying. People were torn apart and the dust from the missile filled the entire area,\" she said.",
      "Later outside Al-Aqsa Hospital, men prayed over shrouded bodies and, in a scene now familiar, if no less heartbreaking after 20 months of war, one of them picked up a tiny white bundle to carry the child to the cemetery."

      "When Brad Squires, now 40, hurled the bottle off the high cliffs of Bell Island, the couple \"thought it wasn't even going to make it to the water, let alone bypass all the rocks and make it across the ocean and and be found,\" Anita Squires, now 35, told NBC News. \"For all the stars to align, for all those things to happen, it seems like an impossible feat for that little bottle, but it was pretty resilient.\"",
      "Back then, the couple had been dating for a year and were in a long-distance relationship: he a police officer in British Columbia and she a trainee nurse in Newfoundland.",

      "They soon forgot about it. They got married in 2016, settling  down in Newfoundland. They have three children, Allie, 19, Gabe, 16, and Harrison, 5.",
      "In Scraggane Bay on Ireland's picturesque Dingle Peninsula, the bottle was found Monday by another couple, Kate and Jon Gay, members of the local charity Maharees Conservation Association, who were doing a beach cleanup.",
      "They kept it until the association's meeting later that night, smashing it open, toasting the unknown writers but failing to get an answer from the number provided. So Farrell posted an appeal on Facebook thinking it might yield an answer in weeks or months. One hour later, Anita Squires had got in touch to say she was the note's author.",
      "\"It was phenomenal,\" Farrell said.",
      "There is a doubly serendipitous side to this story, too.",
      "The Maharees, where the bottle was found, is a 3-mile isthmus of sand that has been battered and eroded by extreme weather and sea-level rises fueled by climate change. So too have parts of Newfoundland.",
      "The grassroots Maharees Conservation Association wants to use this story to link up with people in Newfoundland experiencing the same issues. And the author of the letter in the bottle is going to connect them.",
      "\"They have a soft coastline, they have a sand dune system, and they are also vulnerable to sea level rises,\" Farrell said. \"It's a somber enough affair when you're thinking: How can we actually prepare ourselves for what's to come? So to have this little moment of pure joy in the middle of that, it was very welcome.\"",
      "Anita Squires says that her \"love story is cute, but the work they are doing is so important,\" referring to the conservation group's attempts to protect and adapt their  coastlines to the climate crisis. So, linking these campaigners is \"the beautiful thing at the end of the story.\""

      "The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported at least 37 people killed, including two children, in the clashes between armed groups from the Druze religious minority and Sunni Bedouin clans around the province. The U.K.-based war monitor reported that military convoys were sent to the area to reinforce security checkpoints.",

      "The interior ministry in a statement called the situation a dangerous escalation that \u201ccomes in the absence of the relevant official institutions, which has led to an exacerbation of the state of chaos, the deterioration of the security situation, and the inability of the local community to contain the situation despite repeated calls for calm.\u201d",
      "Factions from the Druze minority have been suspicious of the new authorities in Damascus after former President Bashar Assad fell in a lightning rebel offensive led by Sunni Islamist insurgent groups in December. Earlier this year, Druze groups in Sweida clashed with security forces from the new government.",
      "The Druze religious sect is a minority group that began as a 10th-century offshoot of Ismailism, a branch of Shiite Islam. In Syria, they largely live in the southern Sweida province and some suburbs of Damascus, mainly in Jaramana and Ashrafiyat Sahnaya to the south.",
      "The Druze developed their own militias during the country\u2019s nearly 14-year civil war. Since Assad\u2019s fall, different Druze factions have been at odds over whether to integrate with the new government and armed forces."

      "The PKK, locked in conflict with the Turkish state and outlawed since 1984, decided in May to disband, disarm and end its separatist struggle after a public call to do so from its long-imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan.",
      "After a series of failed peace efforts, the new initiative could pave the way for Ankara to end an insurgency that has killed over 40,000 people, burdened the economy and wrought deep social and political divisions in Turkey and the wider region.",
      "The ceremony was held inside the Jasana cave in the town of Dukan, 37 miles northwest of Sulaymaniyah in the Kurdistan region of Iraq\u2018s north, according to an Iraqi security official and another regional government official.",
      "Around 40 PKK militants and one commander were to hand over their weapons, people familiar with the plan said. It was unclear when further handovers would take place.",
      "The PKK has been based in northern Iraq after being pushed well beyond Turkey\u2019s southeastern frontier in recent years. Turkey\u2019s military has regularly carried out operations and strikes on PKK bases in the region and established several military outposts there.",
      "No footage of the ceremony has been made available yet, but Turkish broadcasters have been showing the crowds gathered near Sulaymaniyah and landscapes of the mountainous region as part of their coverage of what they said was a historic moment.",
      "The arms are to be destroyed later in another ceremony attended by Turkish and Iraqi intelligence figures, officials of Iraq\u2018s Kurdistan regional government, and senior members of Turkey\u2019s pro-Kurdish DEM party \u2014 which also played a key role in facilitating the PKK\u2019s disarmament decision.",
      "The PKK, DEM and Ocalan have all called on Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s government to address Kurdish demands for more rights in regions where Kurds form a majority, particularly the southeast where the insurgency was concentrated.",
      "In a rare online video published on Wednesday, Ocalan also urged Turkey\u2019s parliament to set up a commission to oversee disarmament and manage the broader peace process.",
      "Ankara has taken steps toward forming the commission, while the DEM and Ocalan have said that legal assurances and certain mechanisms were needed to smooth the PKK\u2019s transition into democratic politics.",
      "Omer Celik, a spokesman for Erdogan\u2019s AK Party, said the disarmament process should not be allowed to drag on longer than a few months to avoid it becoming subject to provocations.",
      "Erdogan has said the disarmament will enable the rebuilding of Turkey\u2019s southeast.",
      "Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek has said Turkey spent nearly $1.8 trillion over the past five decades combating terrorism, endorsing the peace steps as an economic boon.",
      "The end of NATO member Turkey\u2019s conflict with the PKK could have consequences across the region, including in neighboring Syria where the United States is allied with Syrian Kurdish forces that Ankara deems a PKK offshoot.",
      "Washington and Ankara want those Kurds to quickly integrate with Syria\u2019s security structure, which has been undergoing reconfiguration since the fall in December of autocratic President Bashar al-Assad. PKK disarmament could add to this pressure, analysts say."

      "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 The International Criminal Court believes war crimes and crimes against humanity are continuing to take place in Sudan's vast western Darfur region where civil war has raged for more than two years, the tribunal's deputy prosecutor said Thursday.",
      "Nazhat Shameem Khan told the U.N. Security Council that the depth of suffering and the humanitarian crisis in Darfur \"has reached an intolerable state,\" with famine escalating and hospitals, humanitarian convoys and other civilian infrastructure being targeted.",
      "\"People are being deprived of water and food,\" she said. \"Rape and sexual violence are being weaponized. Abductions for ransom or to bolster the ranks of armed groups have become common practice.\"",
      "\"And yet we should not be under any illusion,\" Shameem Khan warned the U.N.'s most powerful body. \"Things can still get worse.\"",
      "Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including Darfur. Some 40,000 people have been killed and nearly 13 million displaced, including to other countries, according to U.N. agencies.",
      "ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan told the Security Council in January that there were grounds to believe both government forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Force, may be committing war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide in Darfur.",
      "The Biden administration, just before it left office in January, determined that the RSF and its proxies were committing genocide.",
      "Karim Khan has stepped down temporarily as the ICC chief prosecutor pending the outcome of an investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct, which he categorically denies.",
      "Deputy prosecutor Shameem Khan, who is not related, said the ICC has closely tracked reports in recent weeks of the dire situation in North Darfur, whose capital El Fasher is besieged by RSF and their affiliates. The RSF, which controls the capitals of all other states in Darfur, has also attacked famine-hit Zamzam and other camps for displaced Sudanese in North Darfur.",
      "\"On the basis of our independent investigations, the position of our office is clear, we have reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes and crimes against humanity have been and are continuing to be committed in Darfur,\" Khan told the council.",
      "This conclusion, she said, is based on documentary, testimonial and digital evidence collected by ICC investigators during the past six months, including at refugee camps in neighboring Chad. Over 7,000 items of evidence have been collected to date, she said.",
      "Khan emphasized to the council and to victims that the ICC considers the situation in Darfur \"of the utmost importance\" and will not be deterred until justice is delivered to the perpetrators.",
      "Two decades ago, Darfur became synonymous with genocide and war crimes, particularly by the notorious Janjaweed Arab militias, against populations that identify as Central or East African. Up to 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes.",
      "Khan said those in Darfur now \"inflicting unimaginable atrocities on its population\" should know that while they may feel a sense of impunity, Janjaweed leader Ali Kushayb is currently on trial and the ICC hopes it will be the first of many.",
      "\"However, we also have a duty of confidentiality to the court,\" Khan said. \"I am not able to share more details of the nature of our progress or of specific outcomes hoped for. I can only assure you that the progress we have made is concrete, positive and significant.\""
