      "Despite the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle or sharply cut back on U.S. government-run news outlets like Voice of America, two Persian-language services have been called into duty to report on Israel's war with Iran to Iranian audiences",
      "In the early days of Israel's attack on Iran, U.S.-operated Radio Farda, which broadcasts in the Persian language in Iran, debunked a state media report that an Israeli pilot had been shot down and captured.",
      "Its journalism has continued despite the Trump administration's threat to its future, along with a Persian-language television outlet run by Voice of America.",
      "Radio Farda, a branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and based in Prague, has continued broadcasting even though its managing editor estimated that more than half of its staff had been furloughed. VOA's Persian staff, ordered to go on administrative leave in March, were suddenly ordered back to work last Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe've been giving information to Iranians minute by minute about the conflict,\u201d said Golnaz Esfandiani, managing editor of Radio Farda. That includes explanatory stories about Iran's nuclear program and short videos posted on social media, she said.",
      "Several Iranians have contacted the radio network to express appreciation for reporting that they do not get on Iranian state media, she said. At the same time, families in Iran of five Radio Farda staff members have been pressured by people in the government who want to see the broadcasts stopped, she said.",
      "Through the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the Trump administration has sought to dismantle or sharply curtail the government-funded outlets that provide news reports to countries where there isn't a tradition of free press. The administration says these services operate with a liberal bias.",
      "Both Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are fighting the efforts in court.",
      "Employees at Voice of America's Persian service were notified in an email last Friday from Crystal Thomas, USAGM's human resources director, that they were being recalled and needed to report to work immediately.",
      "Kari Lake, who is running USAGM, told Fox News that \u201cwe are ramping up \u2014 as we've always planned to do \u2014 to meet this historic moment.\u201d",
      "One person who got that email was at the office within three hours and worked until midnight, helping to put out a one-hour broadcast, said the employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak to the press. About 50 people have returned to work. Voice of America is banned in Iran, but many of its citizens find ways through the internet to bypass the ban.",
      "Voice of America's broadcasts \u2014 and social media posts \u2014 have become a challenge to produce because the administration has canceled subscriptions to news services like The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse, said a second employee, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "For the employees, it's a stressful time, putting out urgent news reports without any sense of how long \u2014 or whether \u2014 they will continue to have a job.",
      "\u201cI'm grateful they've brought back our Persian service to continue their role as a trusted voice covering the region for the Iranian people,\u201d said Patsy Widakuswara, VOA's White House correspondent, who is a plaintiff in the court fight to keep the agency alive.",
      "\u201cBut why smash a working system only to cobble it back together when you realize you need it?\u201d Widakuswara asked. \u201cAnd how many crises would it take for them to realize that all VOA language services are important \u2014 before, after and during breaking news?\u201d",
      "During video reports posted online this week, a Voice of America anchor explained where Iranian counterattacks were landing in Israel, and how Iranians were trying to send out information about what is happening through social media.",
      "The danger for a service like VOA, having been off the air and off social media for more than two months, is that Iranian citizens will become accustomed to looking elsewhere for news, said Tom Kent, a media consultant and former president of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.",
      "\u201cYou would hope that people would learn from this that international broadcasting cannot be turned on and off like a light bulb,\u201d said Kent, also a former AP editor.",
      "Despite an Israeli airstrike on its headquarters Monday while the Republic of Iran News Network was broadcasting live, the state-run news service is still operating.",
      "Radio Farda has stayed on the air despite cutbacks. It also continues to have access to news services like the AP, but those contracts will expire at the end of the month, Esfandiani said. Three people have been brought back from furlough to help cover the war, she said.",
      "She said she hopes the conflict lets people who question the service's existence know its value.",
      "\u201cIt's an information war, absolutely,\u201d Esfandiani said. \u201cThese countries \u2014 Iran, Russia and China \u2014 would be very happy if we were gone.\u201d",
      "One of the VOA employees called back to work said they have not been told how long it will be for. Despite evidence this week that someone in the administration saw value in what they do, might they still lose their job eventually?",
      "\u201cI don't want to think about that,\u201d the person said.",

    "story": [
      "In \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d director Danny Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one",
      "Most movies are lucky to predict one thing. Danny Boyle\u2019s 2002 dystopian thriller \u201c28 Days Later\u201d managed to be on the cutting edge of two trends, albeit rather disparate ones: global pandemic and fleet-footed zombies.",
      "Add in Cillian Murphy, who had his breakout role in that film, and \u201c28 Days Later\u201d was unusually prognostic. While many of us were following the beginnings of the Afghanistan War and \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d Boyle and screenwriter Alex Garland were probing the the fragile fabric of society, and the potentially very quick way, indeed, horror might come our way.",
      "Boyle always maintained that his undead \u2014 a far speedier variety of the slow-stepping monsters of George A. Romero\u2019s \u201cThe Night of Living Dad\u201d \u2014 weren\u2019t zombies, at all, but were simply the infected. In that film, and its 2007 sequel \u201c28 Weeks Later\u201d (which Juan Carlos Fresnadillo helmed), the filmmakers have followed the fallout of the so-called rage virus, which emptied London in the first film and brought soon-dashed hopes of the virus\u2019 eradication in the second movie.",
      "Like the virus, the \u201c28 Days Later\u201d franchise has proven tough to beat back. In the new \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d Boyle and Garland return to their apocalyptic pandemic with the benefit of now having lived through one. But recent history plays a surprisingly minor role in this far-from-typical, willfully shambolic, intensely scattershot part three.",
      "The usual trend of franchises is to progressively add gloss and scale. But where other franchises might have gone global, \u201c28 Years Later\u201d has remained in the U.K., now a quarantine region where the infected roam free and survivors \u2014 or at least the ones we follow \u2014 cluster on an island off the northeast of Britain, connected to mainland by only a stone causeway that dips below the water at high tide.",
      "Boyle and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who innovatively employed digital video in \u201c28 Days Later,\u201d have also turned to iPhones to shoot the majority of the film. Boyle, the \u201cSlumdog Millionaire,\u201d \u201cTrainspotting\u201d filmmaker, is an especially frenetic director to begin with, but \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is frequently gratingly disjointed.",
      "It\u2019s a visual approach that, taken with the story\u2019s tonal extremes, makes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d an often bumpy ride. But even when Boyle\u2019s film struggles to put the pieces together, there\u2019s an admirable resistance to being anything like a cardboard cutout summer movie.",
      "The recent event that hovers over \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is less the COVID-19 pandemic than Brexit. With the virus quarantined on Britain, the country has been severed from the European continent. On the secluded Holy Island, 12-year-old Spike (Alfie Williams, a newcomer with some sweetness and pluck) lives with his hunter father, Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and bedridden mother, Isla (Jodie Comer).",
      "The scene, with makeshift watchtowers and bows and arrows for weapons, is almost medieval. Jamie, too, feels almost like a knight eager to induct his son into the village\u2019s ways of survival. On Spike\u2019s first trip out off the island, his father \u2014 nauseatingly jocular \u2014 helps him kill his first infected. Back inside the village walls, Jamie celebrates their near scrapes and exaggerates his son\u2019s coolness under pressure. Other developments cause Spike to question the macho world he\u2019s being raised in.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re all lyin\u2019, mum,\u201d he says to his mother.",
      "After hearing of a far-off, supposedly deranged doctor whose constant fires mystify the townspeople, Spike resolves to take his mother to him in hopes of healing her unknown illness. Their encounters along the way are colorful. Ralph Fiennes plays the doctor, orange-colored when they encounter him; Edvin Ryding plays a Swedish NATO soldier whose patrol boat crashed offshore. Meanwhile, Comer is almost comically delusional, frequently calling her son \u201cDaddy.\u201d",
      "And the infected? One development here is that, while some remain Olympic-worthy sprinters, other slothful ones nicknamed \u201cSlow-Lows\u201d crawl around on the ground, rummaging for worms.",
      "Buried in here are some tender reflections on mortality and misguided exceptionalism, and even the hint of those ideas make \u201c28 Years Later\u201d a more thoughtful movie than you\u2019re likely to find at the multiplex this time of year. This is an unusually soulful coming-of-age movie considering the number of spinal cords that get ripped right of bodies.",
      "It's enough to make you admire the stubborn persistence of Boyle in these films, which he's already extending. The already-shot \u201c28 Days Later: The Bone Temple\u201d is coming next near, from director Nia DaCosta, while Boyle hopes \u201c28 Years Later\u201d is the start of trilogy. Infection and rage, it turns out, are just too well suited to our times to stop now.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for strong bloody violence, grisly images, graphic nudity, language and brief sexuality. Running time: 115 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 When Jeezy released his commercial debut two decades ago, he prepared a contingency plan in case his musical aspirations weren\u2019t achieved.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t know if you\u2019re going to be around in 20 years,\u201d said the drug dealer-turned-rap legend. \u201cThe streets change fast. But it\u2019s also a safe haven, too, \u2019cause it was like, \u2018OK, well, if it doesn\u2019t work, maybe I can go back.\u2019\u201d",
      "But there would be no need: \u201cLet\u2019s Get It: Thug Motivation 101\u201d was met with monumental success. The album, deemed a classic by critics and fans, detailed the Atlanta rapper\u2019s navigation of the drug trade and street life. It debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 with singles like \u201cSoul Survivor\u201d featuring Akon \u2014 which reached No. 4 on the Hot 100 \u2014 and \u201cGo Crazy,\u201d featuring a Jay-Z verse many consider one of his greatest.",
      "With distinctive ad-libs as memorable as his vivid storytelling, Jeezy displayed his gift of motivation, inspiring a vast cross-section of fans.",
      "\u201cThe music and the words resonated so well because they came from a real place. I wasn\u2019t trying to entertain \u2014 I was trying to reach,\" said the \u201cMy President\u201d rapper, who has built a business empire consisting of real estate and partnerships.",
      "In honor of the album's 20th anniversary, Jeezy is launching his \u201cTM:101 Live\u201d tour on June 27 in Miami, encouraging fans to come sharply dressed for the upscale performances. The Color of Noize Orchestra will back him, along with guest DJ Drama from their acclaimed \u201cTrap or Die\u201d mixtape.",
      "Jeezy spoke with the Associated Press about the album's legacy, social media discourse surrounding him and ex-wife Jeannie Mai, and his infamous snowman shirts that were banned at schools over accusations of promoting drug culture. This conversation has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "JEEZY: I just had this feeling that \u2014 if I could just get it out \u2014 that it would be life-changing for me. So, there was a lot of things I was up against at that time and I must say personally, that was probably the most adversity I ever faced. \u2026 I tore my vocal cords because I had polyps on my vocal cords and didn\u2019t know it. And then around the same time, I was hit with Bell\u2019s palsy. And around that time, the album got leaked.",
      "If you\u2019re doing something to change your life and you know that the only other avenues are prison or death, you\u2019re just like, \u201cThis gotta work.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: Samuel L. Jackson told me something a long time ago \u2014 a great friend of mine \u2014 he just said the snowman represents people that were demonized, and it was bigger than me. \u2026 It was this imagery of something that I was inspiring to be. And to know that they would suspend kids from school and keep them from wearing something that would represent that tells me that the message was loud and clear. \u2026 \u201cWe got a people\u2019s champ.\u201d",
      "JEEZY: It\u2019s like a tree: It grows where it\u2019s soft at, not where it is hard. It\u2019s just like over time, leaves fall off, branches fall off but the tree continues to grow.",
      "Everybody don\u2019t have the same vision or goals. And if you allow them, they\u2019ll sink the ship \u2014 or they\u2019ll chop down the tree.",
      "JEEZY: I just live my life, man. You know, joy, peace, and freedom, brother. I don\u2019t know these people, so I can\u2019t even feel no type of way. That\u2019s on them \u2014 I got better things to do. I\u2019ve got goals, dreams, aspirations, so I don\u2019t get caught up in it, \u2019cause I don\u2019t go for the good, either. \u2026 I\u2019m not reading the comments to see what somebody said about me good, because none of it matters.",
      "JEEZY: I do want to shout out LISC (Local Initiatives Support Corporation) which is my partner on my nonprofit space. They\u2019re amazing. We\u2019re actually focusing in on prostate cancer, and then also helping the inner city youth with education, entrepreneurship. ... I\u2019d like to shout out the Urban League of Atlanta, and we have the Young CEOs program.",

      "After Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza's viral controversial performance at Dodger Stadium, Dodgers fans have grown frustrated over the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for local immigrant communities impacted by the rise of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enfo...",
      "LOS ANGELES -- As fans removed their caps and stood for the national anthem Saturday night at Dodger Stadium, they were met with a surprising rendition of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\u201d Latin pop and R&B singer Nezza stood in front of the crowd, closed her eyes and belted the song out \u2014 in Spanish.",
      "Her 90-second rendition, and a behind-the-scenes video she shared on social media of team representatives discouraging it beforehand, quickly went viral and have become a flashpoint for Dodgers fans frustrated by the team\u2019s lack of vocal support for immigrant communities impacted by the deportation raids across the U.S., including numerous neighborhoods in and around Los Angeles.",
      "Protests over the arrests made by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have captured international attention and mostly been held in areas a short drive from Dodger Stadium.",
      "Nezza says even after the discouragement from the team's representative, she hadn\u2019t yet decided whether to sing in English or Spanish until she walked out onto the field and saw the stands filled with Latino families in Dodger blue.",
      "\u201cThis is my moment to show everyone that I am with them that we have a voice and with everything that\u2019s happening it's not OK. I'm super proud that I did it. No regrets,\u201d the 30-year-old singer told The Associated Press.",
      "The team has yet to make a statement on the record regarding the arrests and raids.",
      "Manager Dave Roberts has said he doesn't know enough about the issue to comment, but Dodgers hitter Kik\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez separately spoke out on Instagram over the weekend.",
      "\u201cI am saddened and infuriated by what\u2019s happening in our country and our city,\u201d he said in a post in English and Spanish. \u201cI cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused and ripped apart. ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity and human rights.\u201d",
      "In her viral TikTok video, Nezza is shown speaking with an off-camera Dodgers employee who tells her, \u201cWe are going to do the song in English today, so I\u2019m not sure if that wasn\u2019t transferred or if that wasn\u2019t relayed.\u201d She\u2019s received an outpouring of support since Saturday from celebrities like Jason Mraz, Kehlani, Chiquis, Ava DuVernay, The Kid Mero, Becky G and more.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t you dare turn your backs on us now. We, as a city, have embraced you and need your support more than ever. Think about who fills up your stadium,\u201d said Becky G, addressing the Dodgers in her Instagram story.",
      "The Spanish-language version Nezza sang, \u201cEl Pend\u00f3n Estrellado,\u201d is the official translation of the national anthem and was commissioned in 1945 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt from Peruvian-American composer Clotilde Arias.",
      "Nezza says her manager immediately received a call from an unidentified Dodgers employee saying their clients were not welcome at the stadium again, but the baseball team said in a statement to the AP: \u201cThere were no consequences or hard feelings from the Dodgers regarding her performance. She was not asked to leave. We would be happy to have her back.\u201d",
      "Dodger Stadium has a long history with immigrant communities in Los Angeles.",
      "Many proudly wear Dodger blue jerseys and merchandise as an extension of their love for the city \u2014 the team still sells special \u201cLos Dodgers\u201d jerseys on its official website \u2014 and attend the stadium\u2019s multiple heritage nights honoring Mexican, Salvadoran, Guatemalan and more immigrant communities, including those from outside Latin America. The Dodgers' fan base is heavily Latino, and the team is among the select few to offer Spanish-language television broadcasts.",
      "The franchise is also frequently praised for its history seeking out diverse talent, including Jackie Robinson (baseball\u2019s first Black player), Fernando Valenzuela (a Mexican icon who transcended baseball) and Chan Ho Park (the first Korean in the big leagues).",
      "But the relationship is not without tension, with some Mexican American and Latino residents resentful of the team\u2019s forceful eviction of Latino families in the 1950s to build Dodger Stadium in what is popularly known as Chavez Ravine.",
      "Fans have since called for a boycott online, while others say they\u2019d be willing to return if the team spoke out.",
      "\u201cWe love you. You\u2019ve been so much a big part of our lives. \u2026 We would like to understand that you love us just the same. Or are we just money to you?\u201d asked Power 106's Brown Bag Mornings host Letty Peniche in an Instagram video.",
      "Los Angeles resident Alora Murray is considering a temporary boycott.",
      "\u201cNobody is messing around about this,\u201d said Murray. \u201cLos Angeles is built upon the Dodgers. For them to not kind of be with us, I feel like us boycotting or not going to games will send that message.\u201d",
      "Many in the Latino community have been sharing videos of stadium security confronting fans who have political signs or messages on their clothing.",
      "Longtime Dodger fan Emeli Avalos says she doesn\u2019t believe the team is apolitical since they released a statement to condemn Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s really about staying out of politics, then why do they support that? But when people down the street from them are getting taken, kidnapped, why do they stay silent?\u201d she said.",
      "Avalos attended Pride Night on June 13 wearing a shirt that said \u201cAbolish ICE\u201d on the front and \u201cFDT\u201d \u2014 an acronym for an expletive directed at President Donald Trump \u2014 on the back. In a popular TikTok video, Avalos is seen speaking with Dodgers security. She says she thought she was going to be asked to leave but was instead asked to cover the back of her shirt with her jersey.",
      "\u201cThey told me, \u2018The front is fine, you just gotta cover the back,\u2019\u201d said Avalos, who said she will not be returning to the stadium.",
      "Another video of a fan being confronted by security for holding a banner with \u201cICE\u201d crossed out circulated online over the weekend, furthering criticism of the team.",
      "When asked about the incidents, a Dodgers spokesperson pointed to the team's stadium guidelines, which state the team \u201cdoes not allow signs or banners of any kind.\u201d Also prohibited is any attire the Dodgers deem \u2014 at their sole discretion \u2014 to be obscene, profane, vulgar, indecent, violent, threatening, abusive or prejudiced against any individual or group.",
      "Nezza does not think she will return to the stadium, despite the Dodgers' statement, but says she hopes her performance will inspire others to use their voice and speak out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just shown me like how much power there is in the Latin community,\u201d she said. \u201cWe gotta be the voice right now.\u201d",

For its dedicated audience, the North Carolina alt-country-meets-indie rock band Wednesday is an exemplar in evocative songwriting, where whole worlds are found in short lyrical lines.",

      "Wednesday began as Hartzman's solo project, evidenced in 2018's sweet-sounding \u201cyep definitely.\u201d They became a full band on 2020's \u201cI Was Trying to Describe You to Someone,\u201d a dive into guitar distortions, and 2021's \u201cTwin Plagues,\u201d a further refinement of their \u201ccreek rock\u201d sound. The lineup consists of Hartzman, bassist Margo Schulz, lap steel player Xandy Chelmis, guitarist Jake Lenderman and drummer Alan Miller. Some also tour with Lenderman's solo project, MJ Lenderman. (Hartzman and Lenderman previously dated.)",
      "Wednesday's last album, the narrative \u201cRat Saw God,\u201d was named one of the best albums of 2023 by The Associated Press partially for its uncanny ability to dive into the particularities and complications of Southern identity. \u201cBleeds\u201d sharpens those tools.",
      "\u201cOriginally, I was going to call it \u2018Carolina Girl\u2019 but my bandmates did not like that,'\u201d Hartzman jokes.",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d comes from the explosive opening track, \u201cReality TV Argument Bleeds.\u201d",
      "She likes how the band name and album title sound together \u2014 \u201c'Wednesday Bleeds,' which I feel like I do, when I play music ... I'm almost, in a way, bloodletting and exorcising a demon.\u201d",
      "Lyrically, \u201cBleeds\u201d features some of Wednesday's best work \u2014 even in the revisiting of an older song, \u201cPhish Pepsi,\u201d that hilariously references both the jam band and the most disturbing movie released in 2010 \u2014 a kind of specificity born from Hartzman's writing practices. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she and Lenderman \u201cwrote 20 lines of writing each day,\u201d a practice adopted from Silver Jews' David Berman. She's also a documentarian of memory: She takes notes of things her friends say and images that are affecting, to later collage them together in songs.",
      "\u201cThe well never runs dry,\u201d Hartzman says. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve admitted not everything can come from inside. I need to look outward outside of myself for inspiration.\u201d",
      "Remembering, she says, \u201cis the goal for most of the (expletive) I do. ... I care. I want stories to persist.\u201d",
      "\u201cBleeds\u201d manages cohesion across a variance of sound. \u201cWasp\u201d is hard-core catharsis; lead single \u201cElderberry Wine\u201d drops guitar noise for shimmery, fermented country. \u201cWound Up Here (By Holding On),\u201d which references the Appalachian poet Evan Gray, is a pretty indie rock track about a hometown hero who drowns.",
      "The quietest moment on the album, the plucked \u201cThe Way Love Goes,\u201d was written as \u201ca love song for Jake when we were still together. \u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 as well.'\u201d Hartzman explains. \u201c\u2018Elderberry Wine\u2019 is kind of talking about me noticing slight changes in a relationship.\u201d",
      "These are not breakup songs; they exist right before the point of dissolution. \u201cSweet song is a long con / I drove ya to the airport with the E-brake on,\u201d she sings on the latter.",
      "Later: \u201cSometimes in my head I give up and / Flip the board completely.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m understanding how sound creates emotion. That\u2019s what I\u2019m learning over time,\u201d Hartzman says of her musical growth. \u201cI\u2019m also listening to more music with every year that passes. So, my understanding of what\u2019s possible, or what I can be inspired by, shifts.\u201d",
      "A number of the songs pull from childhood memory, as they always have across Wednesday's discography. \u201cI think about growing up a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I think of trying to tell ... a story that\u2019s vivid and intense, that\u2019s just the easiest time in my life, where everything felt vivid and intense.\u201d",
      "Longtime fans of the band will find recurring themes and characters from past songs. For example, \u201cGary's\u201d from their 2021 album returns as the \u201cBleeds\u201d closer in \u201cGary\u2019s II,\u201d where he gets into a bar fight.",
      "\u201cIn a way, I\u2019m writing the same songs over and over, but I\u2019m just trying to make them better,\u201d she says.",
      "There is always more humanity to excavate. And often, those emotions, \u201cthey aren't done with you,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey're not letting you go.\u201d",
      "So, let the bloodletting begin.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Jeff Ross, a comedian known for hosting brutal roasts of celebrities, is coming to Broadway this summer with a one-man autobiographical show that will offer fans a softer, more intimate side.",
      "\u201cThe hard part for me is letting go of a bit of my armor \u2014 of my roastmaster persona \u2014 and letting the audience get to me so that I can then get them,\u201d he tells The Associated Press ahead of a formal announcement Wednesday. \u201cI think it\u2019s healthy to change it up and surprise people.\u201d",
      "\u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d will play the Nederlander Theatre starting Aug. 5 for an eight-week engagement through Sept. 29.",
      "The show will explore Ross' close relatives, especially his grandfather on his mother's side \u2014 Ross calls him \u201cthe hero of my childhood\u201d \u2014 who stepped up after the comedian's parents died when he was a teenager.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very autobiographical, but it\u2019s also not really about just me. It\u2019s about all of us. When I talk about my uncle or my mom, I want you to see your uncle and your mom in the stories. That\u2019s really important to me,\u201d Ross says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very joyful. It kind of takes the stigma out of loss and sickness and lets people know that they\u2019re going to be OK no matter what happens.\u201d",
      "The title comes from the days when Ross was living with his grandfather in New Jersey. The younger man would take his grandfather to doctor visits or visit him in the hospital during the day and at night go into New York for open-mic nights.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather would always give me money for the bus and a banana, and he\u2019d say, \u2018Take a banana for the ride.\u2019 I reluctantly took it, and more often than not, I\u2019d be stuck in traffic, or I\u2019d get low blood sugar, and that banana would be a lifesaver,\u201d says Ross.",
      "\u201cBut it was really his way of saying, \u2018Be ready for anything\u2019 and also, \u2018I can\u2019t go with you but I\u2019m there with you in spirit.\u2019 So it was an emotional thing, it was a practical thing. It\u2019s something that I still do.\u201d",
      "Ross is known as \u201cThe Roastmaster General\u201d for his incendiary takedowns of Justin Bieber, Rob Lowe, Alec Baldwin and Tom Brady, among many others.",
      "The seeds for \u201cJeff Ross: Take a Banana for the Ride\u201d were planted in the mid-1990s when Ross gathered jokes and stories about his grandfather for an hourlong set. But digging up the past proved too much.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t sustain it emotionally. It was just too much for me as a 30-year-old guy,\u201d Ross says. \u201cBut now, 30 years later, I can dig in and look back and add a layer of experience over it all.\u201d",
      "He was spurred on in large part to losing three comedic friends \u2014 Bob Saget, Gilbert Gottfried and Norm Macdonald \u2014 within eight months. \u201cThat motivated me to look back at the old show from decades earlier and rewrite it completely for my current brain and my current skill set.\u201d",
      "Ross will be the latest comedian to come to Broadway, following John Mulaney, Mike Birbiglia, Alex Edelman, Amy Schumer, Keegan-Michael Key, Rachel Dratch, Billy Crystal and Colin Quinn. Bill Burr made his Broadway debut this year in a revival of \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross.\u201d",
      "Ross reaches back even further. His aunt took him to see Jackie Mason\u2019s \u201cThe World According to Me!\u201d in the 1980s, and the young comedian was floored by the comedian's captivating set.",
      "\u201cIt was elegant, but it was also punk rock because he was being bawdy and naughty and hilarious and saying taboo things and it really, really stayed with me for a long, long time.\u201d",

      "Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark",
      "NEW YORK -- Fifty years after \u201cJaws\u201d sunk its teeth into us, we\u2019re still admiring the bite mark.",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s 1975 film, his second feature, left such a imprint on culture and Hollywood that barely any trip to the movies, let alone to the beach, has been the same since.",
      "Few films have been more perfectly suited to their time and place than \u201cJaws,\u201d which half a century ago unspooled across the country in a then-novel wide release accompanied by Universal Pictures' opening-weekend publicity blitz. \u201cJaws\u201d wasn\u2019t quite the first movie to try to gobble up moviegoers whole, in one mouthful (a few years earlier, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d more or less tried it), but \u201cJaws\u201d established \u2014 and still in many ways defines \u2014 the summer movie.",
      "That puts \u201cJaws\u201d at the birth of a trend that has since consumed Hollywood: the blockbuster era. When it launched in 409 theaters on June 20, 1975, and grossed a then-record $7.9 million in its first days, \u201cJaws\u201d set the template that\u2019s been followed ever-after by every action movie, superhero flick or dinosaur film that\u2019s tried to go big in the summer \u2014 a sleepy time in theaters before \u201cJaws\u201d came around.",
      "And yet the \u201cJaws\u201d legacy is so much more than being Hollywood\u2019s ur-text blockbuster. It\u2019s not possible to, 50 years later, watch Spielberg\u2019s film and see nothing but the beginning of a box-office bonanza, or the paler fish it\u2019s inspired. It\u2019s just too good a movie \u2014 and too much unlike so many wannabes since \u2013\u2014 to be merely groundbreaking. It\u2019s a masterpiece in its own right.",
      "\u201cIt supercharged the language of cinema,\u201d the filmmaker Robert Zemeckis says in the upcoming documentary \u201cJaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story,\u201d premiering July 10 on National Geographic.",
      "That documentary, with Spielberg\u2019s participation, is just a small part of the festivities that have accompanied the movie's anniversary. Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where \u201cJaws\u201d was shot, is hosting everything from concerts to \u201cJaws\u201d-themed dog dress-ups. \u201cJaws,\u201d itself, is streaming on Peacock through July 14, along with a prime-time airing Friday on NBC, with an intro from Spielberg. The \u201cJaws\u201d anniversary feels almost more like a national holiday \u2014 and appropriately so.",
      "But if \u201cJaws\u201d is one of the most influential movies ever made, Hollywood hasn't always drawn the right lessons from it. \u201cWe need a bigger boat\u201d has perhaps been taken too literally in movies that have leaned too much on scale and spectacle, when neither of those things really had much to do with the brilliance of Spielberg\u2019s classic.",
      "For the film\u2019s 50th anniversary, we looked at some of the things today's Hollywood could learn from \u201cJaws\" 50 years later.",
      "Every time I rewatch \u201cJaws\u201d \u2014 which I highly recommend doing on some projected screen, even a bedsheet, and preferably with an ocean nearby \u2014 I marvel at how much it gets from its Martha\u2019s Vineyard setting.",
      "Where U.S.-made film productions are shot has been a hot button issue lately. Various incentives often determine movie shooting locations, with set dressings, or CGI, filling in the rest. But \u201cJaws\u201d shows you just how much more than tax credits you can get from a locale.",
      "Spielberg was convinced the adaptation of Peter Benchley\u2019s novel \u2014 inspired by Benchley\u2019s childhood summers on Nantucket \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be done in soundstages. After looking up and down the Atlantic coast, he settled on Nantucket\u2019s neighboring island. Like his first film, the Mojave Desert-set \u201cDuel,\u201d Spielberg wanted his mechanized shark to swim in a real, definable place.",
      "\u201cI felt the same way about \u2018Jaws,\u2019\u201d Spielberg says in the documentary. \u201cI wanted to go to the natural environment so there was some kind of verisimilitude. So it needed to be in the ocean, out to sea.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t easy. The budget for \u201cJaws\u201d nearly tripled to $9 million and the shoot extended from 55 to 159 days. Spielberg would never again be under financial pressure on a picture, but the tortured \u201cJaws\u201d production put him under a microscope. An AP report from 1975 began: \u201cIt is news when a 26-year-old film director goes $2 million over budget and two and a half months over schedule and manages to avoid getting fired.\u201d",
      "More than any other time in his career, Spielberg fretted.",
      "\u201c\u2018Jaws\u2019 was my Vietnam,\u201d he told Richard Schickel. \u201cIt was basically naive people against nature and nature beat us every day.\u201d",
      "It also infused every inch of the frame with smalltown New England flavor in the way that no soundstage, or CGI, ever could.",
      "When Spielberg was ready to start filming, his star attraction wasn\u2019t. The mechanized shark, nicknamed \u201cBruce\u201d after the director\u2019s attorney, suffered frequent failures that forced Spielberg to find different approaches to shooting his shark scenes early in the film.",
      "\u201cJaws\u201d instead became, to Spielberg, a kind of homage to Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cPsycho.\u201d The suspense came less from the shark than the fear of the unknown and that spine-tingling question: What\u2019s in the water? Spielberg, with the significant aid of John Williams\u2019 instantly iconic score, delayed the appearance of his Great White until well into the film.",
      "\u201cThe visual ellipsis,\u201d the critic Molly Haskell wrote, \u201ccreated far greater menace and terror, as the shark is nowhere and everywhere.\u201d",
      "Spielberg once estimated that Bruce\u2019s mechanical delays added $175 million to the movie\u2019s box office. On its initial run, \u201cJaws\u201d grossed $260.7 million domestically in 1975. Adjusted for inflation, that\u2019s about $1.5 billion. Nowadays, the shark would almost certainly be done, like most movie creatures, with computer animation. But \u201cJaws\u201d showed that often the most powerful source of dread is our imagination.",
      "This is the time of year when the fate of the world often hangs in the balance. All manner of summer movies have had no bones about destroying cities for a mere plot point. Yet for all its terror, \u201cJaws\" features only a handful of deaths. All of its drama is human-scaled. Compared to more swaggering blockbusters today, \u201cJaws\u201d would be considered a modest, mid-budget movie.",
      "That\u2019s partially why you have to almost remind yourself that the movie has only three main characters in Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw). Casting director Sherry Rhodes peopled the cast with locals from the island, many of whom inject the film with little moments of day-to-day humanity. \u201cJaws,\u201d in that way, feels more like a community than a cast.",
      "On the one hand, \u201cJaws\u201d had little to do directly with its times. The Vietnam War had just ended. Watergate had just led to the resignation of President Nixon. The heart-stopping story of a shark off the Massachusetts shoreline promised escapism.",
      "Yet \u201cJaws\u201d has endured as a parable of capitalism, pulled out time and time again to illustrate those endlessly repeating clashes of cash versus social safety.",
      "\u201cAmity is a summer town,\u201d says Amity\u2019s mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) in the film. \u201cWe need summer dollars.\u201d",
      "The shark gets the theme song and the movie poster, but the real villain of \u201cJaws\u201d wears a pinstripe suit and smiles for the cameras. \u201cAs you can see, it\u2019s a beautiful day and the beaches are open,\u201d he says. More than the predator in the ocean, he, and the town, feast on human flesh.",
      "There are boatloads of movies \u2014 including the three sequels that followed after \u2014 that have tried in vain to capture some of the magic of \u201cJaws.\u201d But what happened in June 1975, let alone on Martha\u2019s Vineyard the year before, isn\u2019t repeatable. Even the greatest movies are products of a thousand small miracles. That title? Benchley came up with it minutes before going to print. The iconic poster came from Roger Kastel's painting for the book. Scheider, for instance, learned about the movie by overhearing Spielberg at a party. Williams relied on just two notes for one of the most widely known film scores in movie history.",
      "But no ingredient mattered more on \u201cJaws\u201d than the man behind the camera. Filmmaking talents like Spielberg come around maybe a couple times a century, and in \u201cJaws,\u201d he emerged, spectacularly. What's maybe most striking about \u201cJaws\u201d 50 years later is how much it still doesn't look like anything else.",
      "___",
      "Jake Coyle has been writing about movies for the AP since 2013. He's seen \u201cJaws\u201d at least a dozen times, and screened it for his kids when they were debatably too young for it.",

      "Bruce Springsteen has been deliberate in his career, careful with his album releases to keep a narrative flow and not repeat himself",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruce Springsteen's new project, \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums,\u201d is entirely about that age-old question: What if?",
      "The box set, out June 27, comprises seven albums encompassing the period between 1983 and 2018, all but one he prepared to release in its time but ultimately shelved. Now that he's decided to drop them simultaneously, they offer a fascinating alternative story of his musical life.",
      "Building on its predecessor \u201cTracks,\u201d 1998's four-disc, 66-song collection of unreleased material, there are 83 songs here. While some slipped out on other projects \u2014 \u201cMy Hometown\u201d and \u201cSecret Garden\u201d among them \u2014 the vast majority hadn't been heard publicly. This is all fully completed material, not half-baked or half-finished outtakes. It's not unusual for artists to leave songs \u2014 or even full-lengths \u2014 on the cutting-room floor, but multiple entire albums? Springsteen explains that he's taken care releasing albums, looking to build a narrative arc for his career, and believes this approach has served him well.",
      "Perhaps as a result, the most interesting work on \u201cTracks II\u201d comes when he stretches out and explores pathways not in his wheelhouse: countrypolitan Bruce, border-town Bruce, Burt Bacharach-inspired Bruce and a set of synthesizer-based songs modeled after his Oscar-winning \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Oddly, the one disc of strays cobbled together that feels most like an E Street Band record is the least compelling.",
      "Since these are seven distinct albums, it's worth evaluating them that way.",
      "\u201cLA Garage Sessions '83\u201d captures Springsteen working virtually alone at a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was squarely in between his \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d albums, and he seems torn between those two approaches. There are character studies here, and more lighthearted fare like \u201cLittle Girl Like You,\u201d with a single man yearning to settle down. The most striking cut is \u201cThe Klansman,\u201d about a boy and his racist father, yet it cries out for more development. Ultimately, Springsteen chose the right albums to release at the time.",
      "The song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d was a genuine departure musically, and Springsteen decided to make an album in the same vein, with synthesizers and drum loops the dominant elements. If released in the early 1990s, this would have been the most contemporary-sounding disc of his career, with atmospherics that occasionally recall U2. Springsteen pulled it at the last minute, reasoning that the stories of doomed relationships \u2014 sample lyric: \u201cWe loved each other like a disease\u201d \u2014 was too much like \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d",
      "At the same time he recorded \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d in 1995, Springsteen also convened a country band steered by pedal steel player Marty Rifkin. Their work was terrific, led by the one-two punch of \u201cRepo Man\u201d and the Johnny Rivers cover, \u201cPoor Side of Town.\u201d The title cut to a disc he calls \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d escaped into the public some two decades later. Since the somber \u201cJoad\u201d won a Grammy, who are we to second-guess his choice of what to put out? \u201cNashville,\u201d though, is a rollicking good time.",
      "\u201cInyo\u201d is similar to \u201cJoad\u201d and \u201cDevils & Dust,\u201d mostly acoustic-based narratives, here many of them stories of the Southwest. Springsteen even appropriately brings in mariachi bands for \u201cAdelita\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Charro.\u201d Soozie Tyrell's violin is notable, particularly on the majestic \u201cWhen I Build My Beautiful House.\u201d We're guessing that Springsteen may have considered \u201cInyo\u201d one album too many in the same style, but it's still strong work.",
      "At one point Springsteen considered making \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d his salute to early 1970s California songwriting, a double album. When he didn't, the songs on \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d were left behind. Here Bacharach is the primary influence, and this almost feels like Elvis Costello's collaboration with Burt, only without him (and is the lyric \u201cGod give me strength\u201d a hat-tip to that project?). The crooning Bruce of \u201cSunday Love\u201d is spellbinding, maybe the box's best song. \u201cLonely Town\u201d sits at the intersection of Bacharach and Roy Orbison, while \u201cDinner at Eight\u201d is a lovely sum-up. \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d may startle Springsteen fans \u2014 and impress them, too.",
      "The workmanlike songs on \u201cFaithless\u201d were written on commission in two weeks, the soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It's a good bet it would have been a moody Western.",
      "When Springsteen duels with Tom Morello on the song \u201cAnother Thin Line,\u201d you realize how little you've heard his electric guitar on \u201cTracks II.\u201d The album \u201cPerfect World\u201d is the one here made up of leftovers from different periods, with the greatest E Street Band participation. Here's the deal, though: Most good E Street Band material has already been released. The best left behind for this disc is \u201cYou Lifted Me Up,\u201d with minimalist lyrics and a vocal collaboration with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt.",
      "The box gives Springsteen completists plenty to mull over, and you can question whether these \u201clost discs\u201d would get more attention released separately instead of together. If it's too much, he's releasing a 20-song set of its highlights.",

      "The champ is coming back to chomp.",
      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut announced Monday he will return to compete in this year's Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after skipping last year's gastronomic battle for the coveted Mustard Belt.",
      "\u201cThis event means the world to me,\u201d Chestnut, 41, said in a message posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life.\u201d",
      "It will mark the 20th appearance for the Indiana eater at the Coney Island contest.",
      "Last year, Major League Eating event organizer George Shea said Chestnut, who has won the 10-minute eat-a-thon 16 times, would not be participating due to a contract dispute. Chestnut had struck a deal with a competing brand, the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods.",
      "In a phone interview Monday, the competitive eater made it clear he never appeared in any commercials for the company's vegan hot dogs and that Nathan's is the only hot dog company he has worked with. But Chestnut acknowledged he \u201cshould have made that more clear with Nathan\u2019s.\"",
      "\u201cThere was a little bit of communication that we could have improved on last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I, yeah, I think we figured it out. It took a little bit of finessing.\u201d",
      "Chestnut is still working with Impossible Foods and said \u201cclarifications\u201d have been made to his respective contracts.",
      "Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating, said he did not want to rehash what happened last year because he found it \u201cdispiriting,\u201d but said he\u2019s happy \u201ceverything is resolved\u201d now.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the return of the greatest competitive eater of all time to the biggest competitive eating event of all time. So I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger in any sport,\u201d Shea said. \u201cI mean, this guy is the greatest performer we\u2019ve ever seen in Coney Island and in competitive eating.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he heard from fans over the past year who wanted him to return to the Coney Island event, which is broadcast live on ESPN and even shown overseas.",
      "Last year, he opted to compete against soldiers in Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, in a 5-minute hot dog eating contest. Back in New York, Patrick Bertoletti gobbled up 58 hot dogs to win his first men\u2019s title while defending champion Miki Sudo won her 10th title in the women's division, downing a record 51 links.",
      "Chestnut holds the world record of eating 76 hot dogs.",
      "\u201cOver the last year, I ran into a lot of people who said that it wasn\u2019t the same without me. And I told many people that I was going to work really hard to make sure I got back there,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy that Nathan\u2019s and Major League Eating, we were able all to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he been prepping for the big event and has a couple practice sessions left before the July Fourth holiday.",
      "\u201cMy body's in tune right now,\u201d he said, explaining how he has to build tolerance for consuming so many hot dogs and \u201cget all those muscles used to working together.\u201d He likened the process to boxer getting in practice rounds before a big fight.",
      "Chestnut made it clear his business relationship with Impossible Foods does not mean he has become a vegan, an assumption he said some fans made last year. Chestnut said he was surprised by the \u201cweird blowback\u201d he received about it, explaining he eats a plant-based diet during his recovery from competitive eating events.",
      "\u201cI love meat. I\u2019m going to continue to eat meat. But when I recover from a contest, I have to eat super clean in order to get my body to try to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat pounds of meat every day.\u201d",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisers meet next week, but their agenda suggests they'll skip some expected topics \u2014 including a vote on COVID-19 shots \u2014 while taking up a longtime target of anti-vaccine groups.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations on how to use the nation's vaccines, setting a schedule for children's vaccines as well as advice for adult shots. Last week, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "The agenda for the new committee's first meeting, posted Wednesday, shows it will be shorter than expected. Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session, but the agenda lists no vote on that. Instead, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations, on RSV vaccinations for pregnant women and children and on the use of a preservative named thimerosal that's in a subset of flu shots.",
      "It's not clear who wrote the agenda. No committee chairperson has been named and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not comment.",
      "Missing from the agenda are some heavily researched vaccine policy proposals the advisers were supposed to consider this month, including shots against HPV and meningococcal bacteria, said Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Instead, the committee is talking about subjects \u201cwhich are settled science,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEvery American should be asking themselves how and why did we get here, where leaders are promoting their own agenda instead of protecting our people and our communities,\u201d she said. She worried it's \"part of a purposeful agenda to insert dangerous and harmful and unnecessary fear regarding vaccines into the process.\u201d",
      "The committee makes recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC has no director and the committee's recommendations have been going to Kennedy.",
      "Thimerosal was added to certain vaccines in the early 20th century to make them safer and more accessible by preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials. It's a tiny amount, but because it's a form of mercury, it began raising questions in the 1990s.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a leading voice in an antivaccine movement before he became President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary \u2014 has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger.",
      "Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.",
      "Thimerosal now only appears in multidose flu shot vials, not the single-shot packaging of most of today's flu shots.",
      "Targeting thimerosal would likely force manufacturers to switch to single-dose vials, which would make the shots \u201cmore expensive, less available and more feared,\u201d said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Last week, 30 organizations called on insurers to continue paying for COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women after Kennedy said the shots would no longer be routinely recommended for that group.",
      "Doctors' groups also opposed Kennedy's changes to the vaccine committee. The new members he picked include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a top critic of pandemic-era lockdowns and a leader of a group that has been widely considered to be a source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has long put out its own immunization recommendations. In recent decades it has matched what the government recommended. But asked if they might soon diverge, depending on potential changes in the government's vaccination recommendations, Kressly said; \u201cNothing's off the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to make sure that every child in every community gets the vaccines that they deserve to stay healthy and safe,\u201d she said.",

      "The Food and Drug Administration has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. has approved the world\u2019s only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, maker Gilead Sciences announced Wednesday. It's the first step in an anticipated global rollout that could protect millions \u2013 although it's unclear how many in the U.S. and abroad will get access to the powerful new option.",
      "While a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot \u2014 a drug called lenacapvir \u2014 could be the next best thing. It nearly eliminated new infections in two groundbreaking studies of people at high risk, better than daily preventive pills they can forget to take.",
      "\u201cThis really has the possibility of ending HIV transmission,\u201d said Greg Millett, public policy director at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.",
      "Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly but what's called PrEP \u2014 regularly using preventive medicines such as the daily pills or a different shot given every two months \u2014 is increasingly important. Lenacapavir's six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more frequent doctor visits or stigma from daily pills.",
      "But upheaval in U.S. healthcare \u2014 including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid \u2014 and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.",
      "Millett said \"gaping holes in the system\" in the U.S. and globally \"are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into people\u2019s bodies but make sure they come back\u201d even as little as twice a year.",
      "Gilead\u2019s drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. It\u2019s given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small \u201cdepot\u201d of medication to slowly absorb into the body.",
      "Gilead didn't immediately announce its price. The drug only prevents HIV transmission \u2013 it doesn\u2019t block other sexually transmitted diseases.",
      "Global efforts at ending the HIV pandemic by 2030 have stalled. There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.",
      "Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.",
      "About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partner's knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.",
      "A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.",
      "Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.",
      "\u201cNow I forget that I\u2019m on PrEP because I don\u2019t have to carry around a pill bottle,\u201d said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.",
      "\u201cMen, women, gay, straight \u2013 it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention,\u201d he added. Just remembering a clinic visit every six months \u201cis a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure you\u2019re taking your pill every day.\u201d",
      "\u201cEveryone in every country who\u2019s at risk of HIV needs access to PrEP,\u201d added Dr. Gordon Crofoot of Houston, who helped lead the study in men. \u201cWe need to get easier access to PrEP that\u2019s highly effective like this is.\u201d",

      "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
      "A small, growing number of employers are putting health insurance decisions entirely in the hands of their workers.",
      "Instead of offering traditional insurance, they\u2019re giving workers money to buy their own coverage in what\u2019s known as Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or ICHRAs.",
      "Advocates say this approach provides small companies that couldn\u2019t afford insurance a chance to offer something. It also caps a growing expense for employers and fits conservative political goals of giving people more purchasing power over their coverage.",
      "But ICHRAs place the risk for finding coverage on the employee, and they force them to do something many dislike: Shop for insurance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe enhanced subsidies, they crowd out private financing,\u201d he said.",

      "Cancer patients say they\u2019ve grown sicker since Argentina\u2019s radical libertarian President Javier Milei took his chainsaw to the public health system",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- To outsiders, the Facebook group chat reads like a snarl of nonsensical emojis and letters. To uninsured Argentine cancer patients, it\u2019s a lifeline.",
      "The surreptitious network connects advocates who have spare drugs to Argentines with cancer who lost access to their treatment in March 2024 when President Javier Milei suspended a federal agency, known as DADSE, that paid for their expensive medications.",
      "Whenever Facebook cracks the coded pleas and removes the group for violating its rules on drug sales, another appears, swelling with Argentines who say they\u2019ve grown sicker since the radical libertarian president took a chainsaw to health care.",
      "\u201cAll I need for my body to function is this medication, and Milei is saying, \u2018There\u2019s no money,\u2019\u201d said Ariel Wagener, a 47-year-old pizza chef with leukemia who was hospitalized this year with failing kidneys after losing access to his medication. Without DADSE, a month's worth of his leukemia drug costs $21,000.",
      "Wagener's condition stabilized after he got leftover medication via Facebook, donated by a family whose loved one had died of cancer.",
      "The halting of millions of dollars of free cancer drugs is just one way Milei\u2019s austerity drive has torn through the public health system that once set Argentina apart in Latin America, ensuring that health care was free for pretty much everyone who couldn't afford private insurance.",
      "Since taking office in December 2023, Milei has slashed Argentina\u2019s health care budget by 48% in real terms. His administration fired over 2,000 Health Ministry employees, including 1,400 over just a few days in January.",
      "As part of Milei\u2019s plan to remake Argentina\u2019s troubled economy and cut waste and bureaucracy, officials gutted the National Cancer Institute, suspending early detection programs for breast and cervical cancer.",
      "They froze federal funds for immunization campaigns, hobbling vaccine access as Argentina confronts a measles outbreak for the first time in decades. They dismantled the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis, leading to testing and treatment delays. They defunded emergency contraception and stopped distributing abortion pills.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing setbacks we haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Fernanda Boriotti, president of Argentina\u2019s Federation of Health Professionals. \"HIV patients without treatment, cancer patients dying for lack of medication, hospitals without resources, health professionals pushed out of the system.\"",
      "The government curtailed medical coverage for retirees and lifted price controls on prescription medication and private health plans, causing prices to spike by 250% and 118% respectively, official data shows.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve stopped buying milk, yogurt, anything that\u2019s not absolutely essential,\u201d said Susana Pecora, 71, who lost the insurance plan that covered her husband's antipsychotic drugs when the price jumped 40% last year.",
      "Milei campaigned on a promise to shrink the state two years before President Donald Trump and Elon Musk took up their own chainsaws.",
      "The Argentine has become a close ally of the Trump administration, including on health policy. Argentina has followed the U.S. out of the World Health Organization, and last month received a visit from U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "Meeting Kennedy in Buenos Aires, Argentine Health Minister Mario Lugones announced a review of Argentina's health system to align it with Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again movement.",
      "\u201cWe have similar visions about the path forward,\u201d Lugones said of Kennedy.",
      "Milei has not yet attempted to replace universal coverage with an insurance-based system, as he vowed on the campaign trail.",
      "But in stripping Argentines of coverage and increasing premiums and out-of-pocket expenses, he is moving Argentina closer to the U.S. model, said Macarena Sabin Paz, health team coordinator at Argentina\u2019s Center for Legal and Social Studies.",
      "\u201cWe are beginning to see the idea ... where if you lose your job, or become seriously ill, you may have to sell your car, whatever you have, to pay for health care,\" she said.",
      "Milei\u2019s staffing cuts have eviscerated agencies tasked with planning, financing and tracking immunization campaigns, disrupting data collection and jeopardizing the country\u2019s respected childhood vaccine program.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a measles outbreak that in April led to Argentina's first measles death in two decades.",
      "\u201cArgentina has been one of the most advanced South American countries and here we see it abandoning public health,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Plotkin, an American physician who helped develop the measles vaccine in the 1960s.",
      "Milei\u2019s spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, did not respond to requests for comment. Lugones also did not respond to questions on the impact of policy changes.",
      "After decades of unbridled spending by left-wing populist governments that brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts, Milei delivered on his campaign promises of taming extreme inflation and notching a fiscal surplus.",
      "But even experts who agree Argentina\u2019s health care system needed reform say the cutbacks have been so deep and fast that they\u2019ve hit like a tidal wave.",
      "\u201cIn terms of the destruction of the state, we\u2019ve never experienced anything like this, not even during the military dictatorship,\u201d said Fabio Nu\u00f1ez, ex-coordinator of the National Directorate for HIV, Hepatitis and Tuberculosis who was among hundreds fired from the agency.",
      "Charged with leading prevention efforts and treatments for infectious diseases, the agency has lost 40% of its staff and 76% of its annual budget. Hospitals now face shortages of everything from virus testing supplies to medications to condoms.",
      "The cuts have coincided with a surge in sexually transmitted infections. Last year HIV cases spiked by 20% and syphilis by 50%.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re avoiding the expense now but will pay for it later as people seek emergency care,\u201d said Cristian Pizzuti, a 31-year-old with HIV who documented 103 cases of patients deprived of their daily antiretroviral pills for weeks at a time last year. Pizzuti said he recently received expired medication and suffered a severe allergic reaction after being switched to a cheaper drug.",
      "Tuberculosis cases also climbed by 25% last year. TB clinics report delays in obtaining test results.",
      "\u201cAs people go about their lives, waiting for results, they are spreading the disease to others,\u201d said Dr. Santiago Jimenez, who treats HIV and TB patients in an impoverished Buenos Aires neighborhood. \"It\u2019s an epidemiological disaster.\u201d",
      "Free public hospitals have become flooded with Argentines who dropped their private insurance due to increased premiums or who lost their job \u2014 and with it, their social security plans funded through payroll contributions. Buenos Aires facilities reported a 20%-30% increase in demand in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period last year.",
      "The strain was visible at the free public Rodolfo Rossi Hospital in La Plata last month, where crowds jostled in the outpatient clinic and long lines spilled from the pharmacy.",
      "Pharmacists have reported drug shortages as mass layoffs caused administrative chaos and the government froze a program that provided basic medications to Argentine public health centers.",
      "Silvana Mansilla, 43, spent half the day waiting to pick up her monthly supply of thyroid medication \u2014 which has doubled in price to $22 \u2014 only to find the hospital had run out. \u201cWhere\u2019s the government? What are they doing about this?\u201d she asked.",
      "With hiring frozen, doctors said they're handling double the patient load.",
      "Overwhelmed by ever-increasing workloads, Argentina\u2019s leading public Garrahan Pediatric Hospital in Buenos Aires has hemorrhaged 200 medical professionals since Milei took office.",
      "As annual inflation neared 200% last fall, their salaries lost half of their purchasing power. Doctors left for jobs abroad or better-paying work in private clinics. None were replaced. Medical residents ran a weeklong strike in May, displaying their pay slips for a month of 70-hour work weeks: $700.",
      "A lawsuit filed by patient advocacy groups said more than 60 cancer patients have died due to the government\u2019s suspension of the DADSE medication program, and over 1,500 patients were waiting for their drugs.",
      "A federal judge ordered the government to reinstate the drug deliveries, but it appealed, arguing that DADSE no longer exists. It said it had created a new, more efficient program to fulfill outstanding requests. But the timeline varies and sometimes the drugs don't come at all.",
      "Timing was everything for patients like Alexis Almir\u00f3n.",
      "His medical records show the government drug bank received his request for an expensive medication to shrink his malignant tumor on Dec. 11, 2023, the day after Milei\u2019s inauguration. His doctor told the agency immediate treatment was urgently needed for the aggressive cancer.",
      "Months passed. His mother, Claudia Caballero, bombarded DADSE with desperate calls asking what was taking so long as Almir\u00f3n\u2019s lymphoma spread from his neck to his brain and stomach. He vomited blood. He lost his eyesight. Caballero tried to crowd-source the $20,000 for a month\u2019s supply of the drug but couldn't raise enough.",
      "On March 12 last year, Almir\u00f3n died at 22.",
      "\u201cThey didn\u2019t give him the chance to choose to live,\u201d Caballero said, her voice breaking.",
      "The day after she buried her son, Caballero received a call from the Health Ministry. They had good news, the caller said: Her son\u2019s medication had finally arrived.",

      "Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, and white people account for the vast majority of the deaths",
      "NEW YORK -- Older U.S. adults are increasingly dying from unintentional falls, according to a new federal report published Wednesday, with white people accounting for the vast majority of the deaths.",
      "From 2003 to 2023, death rates from falls rose more than 70% for adults ages 65 to 74, the report from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The rate increased more than 75% for people 75 to 84, and more than doubled for seniors 85 and older.",
      "\u201cFalls continue to be a public health problem worth paying attention to,\u201d said Geoffrey Hoffman, a University of Michigan researcher who was not involved in the new report. \u201cIt's curious that these rates keep rising.\u201d",
      "The CDC researchers did not try to answer why death rates from falls are increasing. But experts say there may be a few reasons, like gradually improving our understanding of the the role falls play in deaths and more people living longer \u2014 to ages when falls are more likely to have deadly consequences.",
      "More than 41,000 retirement-age Americans died of falls in 2023, the most recent year for which final statistics based on death certificates are available. That suggests that falls were blamed in about 1 of every 56 deaths in older Americans that year.",
      "More than half of those 41,000 deaths were people 85 and older, the CDC found, and white people accounted for 87% of deaths in the oldest category.",
      "Falls can cause head injuries or broken bones that can lead to permanent disability and trigger a cascade of other health problems. A number of factors can contribute to falls, including changes in hearing and vision and medications that can cause light-headedness.",
      "Death rates varied widely from state to state. In 2023, Wisconsin had the highest death rates from falls, followed by Minnesota, Maine, Oklahoma and Vermont. Wisconsin's rate was more than five times higher than the rate of the lowest state, Alabama.",
      "Ice and wintry weather may partly explain why fatal falls were more common in states in the upper Midwest and New England, but experts also pointed to other things at play, like differences in how well falls are reported and to what extent they are labeled a cause of death.",
      "\u201cWe've yet to unravel why you see such differences in state rates,\u201d said Hoffman, who studies falls among the elderly.",
      "Researchers also can't yet explain why white seniors die of falls at higher rates than people in other racial and ethnic groups. In the 85-and-up age group, the death rate for white Americans is two or three times higher than any other group, while older Black people had the lowest fall-related death rate.",
      "\u201cKind of a flip of the traditional disparity lens,\u201d Hoffman said, referring to the fact that for most other rates of illness and injury, people of color are disproportionately affected.",
      "Staying active can help people avoid falls, experts say.",

      "A federal court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from clawing back millions in public health funding from four Democrat-led municipalities in GOP-governed states.",
      "It's the second such federal ruling to reinstate public health funding for several states.",
      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington, D.C., issued a preliminary injunction Tuesday sought by district attorneys in Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, and three cities: Columbus, Ohio, Nashville, Tennessee, and Kansas City, Missouri. The decision means the federal government must reinstate funding to the four municipalities until the case is fully litigated.",
      "\u201cThe federal government cannot simply ignore Congress and pull the plug on essential services that communities rely on,\u201d Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee said. \u201cToday\u2019s decision ensures we can keep doing the work that protects our residents \u2014 from tracking disease outbreaks to providing vaccinations and supporting vulnerable families.\u201d",
      "Their lawsuit, filed in late April, alleged $11 billion in cuts to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention programs had already been approved by Congress and are being unconstitutionally withheld. They also argued that the administration\u2019s actions violate Department of Health and Human Services regulations.",
      "The cities and counties argued the cuts were \u201ca massive blow to U.S. public health at a time where state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases and chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.\u201d The cuts would lead to thousands of state and local public health employees being fired, the lawsuit argued.",
      "The local governments, alongside the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union, wanted the court to reinstate the grants nationwide. But Cooper said in his preliminary injunction that the funds can only be blocked to the four municipalities and in a May 21 hearing expressed skepticism about whether it could apply more widely.",
      "The funding in question was granted during the COVID-19 pandemic but aimed at building up public health infrastructure overall, Menefee said in a statement in April.",
      "The four local governments were owed about $32.7 million in future grant payments, Cooper's opinion notes.",
      "The federal government's lawyers said the grants were legally cut because, \"Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out.\u201d They used the same argument in the case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia over the HHS funding clawback.",
      "Menefee said the cuts defunded programs in Harris County for wastewater disease surveillance, community health workers and clinics and call centers that helped people get vaccinated. Columbus City Attorney Zach Klein said the cuts forced the city to fire 11 of its 22 infectious disease staffers.",
      "Nashville used some of its grant money to support programs, including a \u201cstrike team\u201d that after the pandemic addressed gaps in health services that kept kids from being able to enroll in school, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Kansas City used one of its grants to build out capabilities to test locally for COVID-19, influenza and measles rather than waiting for results from the county lab. The suit details that after four years of work to certify facilities and train staff, the city \u201cwas at the final step\" of buying lab equipment when the grant was canceled.",
      "Representatives for HHS, the CDC and the cities did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday.",

      "April Newkirk told WXIA-TV that 31-year-old Adriana Smith's baby was born prematurely by an emergency cesarean section early Friday, the Atlanta station reported Monday night. She was about six months into her pregnancy. The baby, named Chance, weighs about 1 pound and 13 ounces and is in the neonatal intensive care unit.",

      "Newkirk said her daughter had intense headaches more than four months ago and went to Atlanta\u2019s Northside Hospital, where she received medication and was released. The next morning, her boyfriend woke to her gasping for air and called 911. Emory University Hospital determined she had blood clots in her brain and she was declared brain-dead. She was eight weeks pregnant, according to WXIA.",

      "Three years after the fall of Roe v. Wade, the funding system for abortions is battered",
      "The abortion funding system across the U.S. is battered three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans.",
      "An initial surge of donations has subsided, scores of clinics have closed and advocates fear that federal policy changes will result in more shutting down.",
      "\u201cWe're all collectively struggling,\u201d said Ramsie Monk, director of development at the Women's Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, which opened a clinic in 2023 in western Maryland after abortion was banned in West Virginia.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sustainable model,\u201d said Mercedes Sanchez, executive director at the Cedar River Clinics in Washington. \u201cClinics, providers, funds are all very committed to making sure people can access care, but it is definitely going to be more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Bans in some states mean travel has become a bigger part of obtaining an abortion, bring a host of costs.",
      "A mitigating factor is that most abortions are now done with medications. They can be prescribed by telehealth, including to women in states where abortion is banned. But they can't be used in every case, some women prefer procedures, and there are challenges to the legality of pills and how they're prescribed.",
      "Not all private insurance plans cover abortions. Federal taxpayer funds cannot be used for abortions, but state Medicaid funds cover them in some places. And a network of private funding helps cover procedures or travel and other costs.",
      "The increase in contributions that followed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling has declined for most funds and clinics. \u201cThe resources have not kept pace with demand continuing to surge,\u201d Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund.",
      "With bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy now being enforced in 12 states and bans at about six weeks' gestation being enforced in four others, travel for abortion has become more frequent. Costs for each trip can include plane tickets or gas for long drives, meals, hotels and child care \u2014 all on top of clinic fees.",
      "Last year, the National Abortion Federation's hotline fund reduced the portion of clinic costs it covers for people with financial needs to 30% from 50% so it could help more people as demand increased. The group's says travel costs now average over $1,000 per person.",
      "Travel needs have made the job for abortion funds not only more expensive but more intricate.",
      "Before the Texas ban started in 2021, Fund Texas Choice got about 40 calls a month, executive director Anna Rupani said. Now, it's over 200. And assisting each caller can take more time because they involve arranging flights and hotels, not just lining up rides to clinics in the state.",
      "Some people cobble together money from a hodgepodge of groups to pay for an abortion. Grace McGarry, who manages the phone line for Whole Woman's Health, which operates five clinics across the U.S., said he talked to a patient who was getting aid from nine different groups.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I Need An A, which operates a website dedicated to providing information about abortion options, has tallied 105 clinics closing.",
      "Twenty-nine closures were in states where abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy. Eleven were in states where it's banned at about six weeks' gestation, before many women realize they're pregnant. But 65 of the closures were in other states.",
      "At the same time, 34 clinics have opened anew or moved to states where abortion is legal.",
      "\u201cEach and every one of those has been a blow to that community that hasn\u2019t been refilled,\u201d said Rebecca Nall, the founder of I Need An A.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States announced in May that it would close eight locations in Iowa and Minnesota while expanding services at some other clinics.",
      "Ruth Richardson, the CEO of that Planned Parenthood affiliate, said the reorganization recognizes that the number of abortions in Iowa plummeted after the state started enforcing its strict abortion law. It also reflects that the regional group's overall budget is down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the compounded challenges of the fact that sexual and reproductive health care has been politicized in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the closures are warranted: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s focus is squarely on abortions, gender transitions and political spending.\u201d",
      "In March, the Department of Health and Human Services withheld $27.5 million that groups were expecting to provide family planning, contraception, cancer screening and sexually transmitted infection tests and treatment. Some of the groups also provide abortions and include at least 11 regional Planned Parenthood affiliates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in a public health crisis of epic proportions,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. \"We\u2019re in a situation where there are reproductive health care deserts, not just abortion care deserts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's tax and budget bill that is up for consideration in the Senate after getting House approval would deliver more blows to abortion funding.",
      "It would bar federally subsidized health insurance plans from covering abortion, except if it's necessary to save the life of the woman, or in cases of rape or incest.",
      "The bill also would bar Medicaid funds from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood said those provisions could lead to the closures of about half its clinics that provide abortion \u2014- and about one-fourth of abortion clinics nationwide. The biggest impact on affiliate clinics would be in states where abortion is legal.",
      "Alexis McGill-Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said it's almost been a challenge to fund abortion \u2014 and all health care \u2014 for low-income people.",

      "Kraft Heinz will be pulling certain artificial dyes from its U.S. products starting in 2027 and will no longer roll out new products with the dyes",
      "Kraft Heinz will be pulling certain artificial dyes from its U.S. products starting in 2027 and will no longer roll out new products with the dyes.",
      "The move comes nearly two months after U.S. health officials said that they would urge foodmakers to phase out petroleum-based artificial colors in the nation\u2019s food supply.",
      "Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that almost 90% of its U.S. products already don't contain food, drug & cosmetic colors, but that the products that do still use the dyes will have them removed by the end of 2027. FD&C colors are synthetic additives that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food, drugs and cosmetics.",
      "Kraft Heinz said that many of its U.S. products that still use the FD&C colors are in its beverage and desserts categories, including certain products sold under brands including Crystal Light, Kool Aid, Jell-O and Jet Puffed.",
      "The company said that it will instead use natural colors for the products.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we\u2019ve been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\" Pedro Navio, North America President at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz stripped artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from its macaroni and cheese in 2016 and said it has never used artificial dyes in its ketchup.",
      "The company plans to work with licensees of its brands to encourage them to remove the dyes.",
      "In April Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference that the agency would take steps to eliminate the synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children. The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency announced that the dye known as Red 3 \u2014 used in candies, cakes and some medications \u2014 would be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.",
      "Many U.S. food companies are already reformulating their foods, according to Sensient Colors, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of food dyes and flavorings. In place of synthetic dyes, foodmakers can use natural hues made from beets, algae and crushed insects and pigments from purple sweet potatoes, radishes and red cabbage.",

      "A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients has lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers on Monday, after a judge stepped in for a jury on grounds the evidence presented by the defendants was incontrovertible.",
      "Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh issued his directed verdict against former doctor William Husel, whose attorneys accused Michigan-based Trinity Health and Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus of orchestrating a campaign to destroy his reputation.",
      "Husel was seeking more than $18 million from the health care companies.",
      "His attorney, David Vermillion, said in a statement that Husel's legal team was disappointed that McIntosh would prevent the jury from making a decision in the case after weeks of evidence and testimony had been presented. He said issuing the directed verdict, a procedural move requested by the hospital, \u201ceffectively silences the voices of those who came seeking justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the outcome that any reasonable person expected, nor is it one that reflects the strength of the evidence presented,\" he said. \u201cWe are evaluating all legal options, including appeal. This case has always been about more than one courtroom or one ruling. It is about truth, accountability, and the right of every individual to defend their name against false and damaging accusations.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel issued a statement that said simply, \u201cWe are pleased with the judge\u2019s decision.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel Health System fired the doctor in 2018 after it concluded he had ordered excessive painkillers for about three dozen patients who died over several years.",
      "He initially was charged with murder in 25 deaths in one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional. Eleven counts were dismissed before trial.",
      "Husel, now 49, maintained he was trying to help patients deal with their pain, sometimes in the last moments of their life, not speed up their deaths. Despite being found not guilty by a jury on murder charges in 2022, he permanently surrendered his medical license.",
      "He filed multiple lawsuits against his former employer, accusing Trinity Health and Mount Carmel of defamation and malicious prosecution.",
      "As part of the defamation lawsuit filed in 2019, Husel\u2019s attorneys said Trinity Health repeatedly spread lies and false information to convince the public and law enforcement that Husel was a killer, even though health system officials knew that was not true.",
      "\u201cObviously, these false allegations destroyed Dr. Husel\u2019s life,\u201d the lawsuit said. Husel gave up his medical license because his lawyers said that he knew the damage to his reputation would prevent him from working as a doctor.",
      "In court documents filed two years ago, Husel said he had been unable to find work and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.",
      "Trinity Health had asked a judge to toss the lawsuit, but a Franklin County judge ruled there was enough reason to move forward.",
      "Husel, who worked in the intensive care unit, was charged in cases that involved the use of at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for nonsurgical situations indicated an intent to end lives.",
      "His colleagues who administered the medications at Mount Carmel West Hospital in Columbus weren\u2019t criminally charged, but the hospital said it fired 23 nurses, pharmacists and managers after its internal investigation and referred various employees to their respective state boards for disciplinary action.",
      "The hospital reached settlements in multiple cases involving relatives of the patients who died.",

      "Midway up the Appalachian Trail, a little country store in Gardners, Pennsylvania, invites hikers to take on an additional challenge: eating a half-gallon of ice cream in one sitting",
      "GARDNERS, Pa. -- Sam Cooper had just trekked 7 miles (11 kilometers) through a rain-sodden stretch of the Appalachian Trail when he sat down outside a little country store in Pennsylvania to take on its ice cream challenge.",
      "Nearly 40 minutes and 2,500 calories later, the dairy farmer from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, was polishing off the final titanium sporkful of chocolate chip cookie dough on Tuesday and adding his name to the list of \u201cthru-hikers\u201d who have celebrated the trail's halfway point by downing a half-gallon of ice cream.",
      "By the end Cooper, 32, whose trail name is Pie Top, was calling the experience \u201cpure misery.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think anybody should be doing this,\u201d Cooper said cheerfully. \u201cThis is not healthy at all.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge is thought to have begun more than four decades ago at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store in Gardners, a few miles north of the current true halfway point on the 2,197-mile (3,536-kilometer) trail. Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",
      "As they slog their way north through Virginia and Maryland, the ice cream challenge is a regular topic of conversation among thru-hikers at shelters and campfires, said Stephan Berens, 49, a psychiatric nurse from Nuremberg, Germany.",
      "Berens, whose trail name is Speedy, polished off his black cherry and vanilla in about 25 minutes after completing 17 miles (27 kilometers) on the trail that day \u2014 and with seven (11 kilometers) more to go that afternoon.",
      "Trail experts say hikers can need up to 6,000 calories a day, a practical challenge when food needs to be carried up and down rocky terrain. The slender Berens figures he's lost about 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since starting April 8.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be worse, but it's OK,\u201d said Berens, smiling and patting his stomach after finishing the half-gallon. \u201cSuch a crazy idea.\u201d",
      "Zeke Meddock, trail name Petroglyph, didn't bother timing himself but finished his choice of a quart and a half carton of chocolate chip cookie dough and a pint of strawberry. The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

      "Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.",
      "The poll points to a disconnect between Republicans\u2019 policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate in the coming weeks.",
      "Here\u2019s the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding:",

Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving \u201cabout the right amount\u201d of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs.",
      "About 2 in 10 say Medicaid is overfunded, while about one-quarter say that about food assistance programs.",
      "Republicans are especially likely to say \u201ctoo much\u201d is spent on food and nutrition assistance programs when compared with Democrats and independents \u2014 46% of Republicans say this, compared with about 1 in 10 Democrats and independents.",

      "About 6 in 10 Americans say there is not enough government money going toward Social Security, Medicare or education broadly. But Democrats overwhelmingly think \u201ctoo little\u201d money is allocated to these areas, while Republicans are happier with the status quo.",
      "Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting \u201ctoo much\u201d funding. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans say this about either Medicare or Social Security. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education.",

      "Americans are more divided on whether the government is devoting too much money to the military or border security.",
      "About 3 in 10 say the government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d on the military, while a similar share say the government is spending \u201ctoo little.\u201d Close to 4 in 10 say the government is spending \u201cabout the right amount.\u201d",
      "Republicans are much less likely to say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent on border security than they were before Trump took office again in January. Now, 45% of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent, down from 79% in a January AP-NORC poll.",
      "On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that \u201ctoo much\u201d is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.",
      "The Trump administration has asked Congress for deep reductions to foreign aid programs, including cuts to global health programs and refugee resettlement initiatives.",
      "Foreign aid is one area with more general agreement that there is \u201ctoo much\u201d federal spending. Most U.S. adults, 56%, say the U.S. government is spending too much on assistance to other countries, which is down from 69% in an AP-NORC poll from March 2023.",

      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever.

      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

      "ST. PETERSBURG, Russia -- Russia's economy is \u201con the brink of going into a recession,\u201d the country's economy minister said Thursday, according to Russian media reports.",
      "Economy Minister Maxim Reshetnikov delivered the warning at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, the annual event in Russia's second largest city designed to highlight the country's economic prowess and court foreign investors.",
      "Russian business news outlet RBC quoted the official as saying \u201cthe numbers indicate cooling, but all our numbers are (like) a rearview mirror. Judging by the way businesses currently feel and the indicators, we are already, it seems to me, on the brink of going into a recession.\u201d",
      "Russia\u2019s economy, hit with a slew of sanctions after the Kremlin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, has so far outperformed predictions. High defense spending has propelled growth and kept unemployment low despite fueling inflation. At the same time, wages have gone up to keep pace with inflation, leaving many workers better off.",
      "Large recruiting bonuses for military enlistees and death benefits for those killed in Ukraine also have put more income into the country\u2019s poorer regions. But over the long term, inflation and a lack of foreign investments remain threats to the economy, leaving a question mark over how long the militarized economy can keep going.",
      "Economists have warned of mounting pressure on the economy and the likelihood it would stagnate due to lack of investment in sectors other than the military.",
      "Speaking at one of the sessions of the forum in St. Petersburg, Reshetnikov said Russia was \u201con the brink,\u201d and whether the country would slide into a recession or not depends on the government's actions.",
      "\u201cGoing forward, it all depends on our decisions,\" Reshetnikov said, according to RBC.",
      "RBC reported Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov and Central Bank Gov. Elvira Nabiullina gave more optimistic assessments.",
      "Siluanov spoke about the economy \u201ccooling\u201d but noted that after any cooling \u201cthe summer always comes,\" RBC reported.",
      "Nabiullina said Russia's economy was merely \u201ccoming out of overheating,\" according to RBC.",

      "MADRID -- Spain has rejected a NATO proposal to spend 5% of GDP on defense needs that\u2019s due to be announced next week, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d",
      "In a letter sent Thursday to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said that Spain \u201ccannot commit to a specific spending target in terms of GDP\u201d at next week\u2019s NATO summit in The Hague.",
      "Most U.S. allies at NATO are on track to endorse U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of gross domestic product on their defense and military needs. In early June, Sweden and the Netherlands said that they aim to meet the new target.",
      "Spain was the lowest spender in the 32-nation military alliance last year, directing less than 2% of its GDP on defense expenditure.",
      "In April, S\u00e1nchez said the government would raise defense spending by 10.5 billion euros ($12 billion) in 2025 to reach NATO\u2019s previous target of 2% of GDP.",
      "After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, NATO\u2019s 32 allies agreed to spend at least 2% of GDP on their military budgets. But NATO plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investment of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "Rutte had been due to table a new proposal on Friday aimed at satisfying Spain. European allies and Canada are keen to finalize the spending pledge before the summit, and not leave it open for any heated debate that might drag the meeting out. Poland and the Baltic countries \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 have already publicly committed to 5%, and Rutte has said that most allies were ready to endorse the goal.",
      "A big question still to be answered is what time-frame countries will get to reach the new spending goals. A target date of 2032 was initially floated, but Rutte has said that Russia could be ready to launch an attack on NATO territory by 2030.",

      "Personal luxury goods sales that eroded to 364 billion euros ($419 billion) in 2024 are projected to slide by another 2% to 5% this year, the study said, citing threats of U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions triggering economic slowdowns.",
      "\u201cStill, to be positive in a difficult moment \u2014 with three wars, economies slowing down, inequality at a maximum ever \u2014 it\u2019s not a market in collapse,\u2019\u2019 said Bain partner and co-author of the study Claudia D\u2019Arpizio. \u201cIt is slowing down but not collapsing.\u201d",

      "The Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia are recording growth. Europe is mostly flat, the study showed.",
      "This has created a sharp divergence between brands that continue with strong creative and earnings growth, such as the Prada Group, which posted a 13% first-quarter jump in revenue to 1.34 billion euros, and brands like Gucci, where revenue was down 24% to 1.6 billion euros in the same period.",
      "Gucci owner Kering last week hired Italian automotive executive Luca De Meo, the former CEO of Renault, to mount a turnaround. The decision comes as three of its brands \u2014 Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta \u2014 are launching new creative directors.",

      "\u201cAll of these factors resonate well together in a market like luxury when you are in a phase where growth is still the name of the game, but you also need to make the company more nimble in terms of costs, and turn around some of the brands,\u2019\u2019 she said.",
      "Brands are also making changes to minimize the impact of possible U.S. tariffs. These include shipping directly from production sites and not warehouses and reducing stock in stores.",

      "\u201cMany of these (negative) aspects are not going to change soon. What can change is more clarity on the tariffs, but I don\u2019t think we will stop the wars or the political instability in a few months,\u2019\u2019 she said, adding that luxury consumer confidence is tied more closely to stock market trends than geopolitics.",

      "While luxury spending is sensitive to global turmoil, it is historically quick to rebound, powered by new markets and pent-up demand.",
      "The 2008-2009 financial crisis plummeted sales of luxury apparel, handbags and footwear from 161 billion euros to 147 billion euros over two years. The market more than recovered the losses in 2010 as it rebounded by 14%, with an acceleration in the Chinese market. Similarly, after sales plunged by 21% during the pandemic, pent-up spending powered sales to new records.",

      "Google faces a big setback in its attempt to overturn a multibillion-dollar European Union antitrust penalty involving Android after a top court\u2019s legal adviser sided with regulators",
      "LONDON -- Google faced a big setback Thursday in its attempt to overturn a multibillion-dollar European Union antitrust penalty involving Android after a top court's legal adviser sided with regulators.",
      "The European Court of Justice's advocate general, Juliane Kokott, recommended in a non-binding opinion that Google's appeal against the fine worth more than 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) should be dismissed.",
      "The case dates back to 2018, when the EU\u2019s executive Commission slapped Google with a 4.134 billion euro fine after finding that the U.S. tech company used the dominance of its mobile Android operating system to throttle competition and reduce consumer choice.",
      "After Google filed an initial appeal, a lower court trimmed the penalty to 4.125 billion euros in 2022, which the company also appealed to the Court of Justice.",
      "Kokott advised that the Court of Justice confirm the fine and uphold the lower court's judgment, according to a press release summarizing her opinion.",
      "Google said it was disappointed with the opinion, adding that if the court follows it, it \"would discourage investment in open platforms and harm Android users, partners and app developers.\u201d",

      "The U.K. national regulator for higher education says students at English universities must prepare to confront ideas they find uncomfortable and shocking",
      "LONDON -- Students at English universities must prepare to confront ideas they find uncomfortable and shocking, the national regulator for higher education said as it released new guidelines governing free speech on campuses across the country.",
      "The Office for Students said Thursday that freedom of speech and academic freedom are crucial to higher education, so the guidelines are designed to ensure that universities don\u2019t stifle any form of legal speech on their campuses or in their classrooms.",
      "Students must be allowed to freely share their opinions and be prepared to hear a range of views during their studies, Arif Ahmed, free speech director for the regulator, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis includes things that they may find uncomfortable or shocking,\u201d he said. \u201cBy being exposed to a diversity of academic thought, students will develop their analytical and critical thinking skills.\u201d",
      "The guidance comes as concern grows that British universities had gone too far in silencing professors and students who expressed ideas some people found offensive. In particular, gender-critical academics and pro-Israeli groups say they have been targeted by university officials and students who disagree with their ideas.",
      "In 2021, professor Kathleen Stock resigned from her position at the University of Sussex after a group of students who identified as queer, trans and nonbinary demanded that she be fired for expressing the belief that there are two immutable sexes, male and female. Earlier this year, the Office for Students fined the university 585,000 pounds ($785,000) for failing to uphold freedom of speech.",
      "The guidance released on Thursday is designed to implement legislation protecting freedom of speech on university campuses that was passed by the previous government in 2023.",
      "The regulator stressed that unlawful speech, including speech that violates anti-terror, equality or public order laws, is not protected by the legislation. Universities also have the right to regulate time, place and manner of lawful speech so that that it doesn\u2019t interfere with research, teaching and learning.",
      "While the guidance is a good first step, universities will still have a difficult time balancing all the interests on their campuses, Julian Sladdin, a partner at the law firm Pinsent Masons, told the Guardian newspaper.",
      "\u201cThe difficulty which remains in practical terms is the fact that institutions are still subject to dealing day-to-day with extremely complex and often polarizing issues on campus and where the bounds of what may be lawful free speech are constantly being tested,\u201d he was quoted as saying.",

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is urging greater international pressure on Moscow following a deadly Russian missile strike that hit a Kyiv apartment building this week, killing 23 people",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Thursday said a Russian missile strike on a nine-story Kyiv apartment building was a sign that more pressure must be applied on Moscow to agree to a ceasefire, as Moscow intensifies attacks in the three-year war.",
      "The drone and missile attack on Kyiv early on Tuesday, the deadliest assault on the capital this year, killed 28 people across the city and injured 142 more, Kyiv Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko said on Thursday.",
      "Zelenskyy, along with the head of the presidential office Andrii Yermak and Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko, visited the site of the apartment building in Kyiv\u2019s Solomianskyi district Thursday morning, laying flowers and paying tribute to the 23 people who died there after a direct hit by a missile collapsed the structure.",
      "\u201cThis attack is a reminder to the world that Russia rejects a ceasefire and chooses killing,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote on Telegram, and thanked Ukraine's partners who he said are ready to pressure Russia to \u201cfeel the real cost of the war.\u201d",
      "Tuesday's attack on Kyiv was part of a sweeping barrage as Russia once again sought to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses. Russia fired more than 440 drones and 32 missiles in what Zelenskyy called one of the biggest bombardments of the war, now in its fourth year.",
      "As Russia proceeds with a summer offensive on parts of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, U.S.-led peace efforts have failed to gain traction. Russian President Vladimir Putin has effectively rejected an offer from U.S. President Donald Trump for an immediate 30-day ceasefire, making it conditional on a halt on Ukraine\u2019s mobilization effort and a freeze on Western arms supplies.",
      "Meanwhile, Middle East tensions and U.S. trade tariffs have drawn world attention away from Ukraine\u2019s pleas for more diplomatic and economic pressure to be placed on Moscow.",
      "Russia in recent weeks has intensified long-range attacks that have struck urban residential areas. Yet on Wednesday, Putin denied that his military had struck such targets, saying that attacks were \u201cagainst military industries, not residential quarters.\u201d",
      "Speaking to senior news leaders of international news agencies in St. Petersburg, Putin said he was open to talks with Zelenskyy, but repeated his claim that the Ukrainian leader had lost his legitimacy after his term expired last year \u2014 allegations rejected by Kyiv and its allies.",
      "\u201cWe are ready for substantive talks on the principles of a settlement,\u201d Putin said, noting that a previous round of talks in Istanbul had led to an exchange of prisoners and the bodies of fallen soldiers.",
      "Putin on Wednesday praised Trump\u2019s push for peace in Ukraine. But Ukraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X on Thursday that it was his country that had \u201cunconditionally accepted\u201d the U.S. proposal for a ceasefire, and said that Russian claims of willingness to end the war were \u201cmanipulations.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has been exactly 100 days since Ukraine unconditionally accepted the U.S. peace proposal to completely cease fire, put an end to the killing, and move forward with a genuine peace process ... 100 days of Russia escalating terror against Ukraine rather than ending it,\u201d Sybiha wrote.",
      "\u201cUkraine remains committed to peace. Unfortunately, Russia continues to choose war, disregarding U.S. efforts to end the killing,\u201d he added.",
      "Overnight on Wednesday, Russia fired a barrage of 104 Shahed and decoy drones across Ukraine, according to the country's air force. Of those, 88 were intercepted, jammed, or lost from radars mid-flight.",
      "There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage caused by the attack.",

      "BANGKOK -- Thousands of supporters of Myanmar\u2019s jailed former leader Aung San Suu Kyi celebrated her 80th birthday Thursday by attempting to set a world record for the most birthday greeting videos, while others took to the streets in demonstrations against the military government that ousted her.",
      "Kalo Say Htoo, an organizer of the birthday video campaign, said the original goal was to collect 80,000 greeting videos to honor Suu Kyi and achieve a recognized Guinness World Record.",
      "The number of videos collected surpassed 103,000 on Thursday, tripling the current record of 32,207 achieved in 2017, organizers said.",
      "Suu Kyi was arrested in February 2021 when the military seized power from her democratically elected government. She was convicted on more than a dozen charges for offenses that her supporters say were concocted to keep her out of politics. She remains regarded by many in Myanmar as the country\u2019s legitimate leader while serving a 27-year prison term.",
      "Kim Aris, Suu Kyi\u2019s son living in London, said in a statement on Facebook Thursday that the campaign is a powerful testament to his mother's global support.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my hope this achievement brings urgent attention to her plight and that of the people of Burma,\u201d said Aris, using the country's former name. \u201cHer voice may be silenced, but her flame will never be extinguished.\u201d",
      "Aris planned to run 80 kilometers (49.7 miles) to honor his mother\u2019s birthday, while encouraging others to show support with the numerical theme, such as walking for 80 minutes or making 80 recipes.",
      "More than 6,800 civilians are estimated to have been killed by security forces during a widespread armed struggle against military rule that began after generals seized power from Suu Kyi\u2019s elected government, according to figures compiled by nongovernmental organizations.",
      "Pro-democracy street protests in Suu Kyi\u2019s honor were held Thursday in areas that are not under military control including northern Kachin state, the central regions of Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway and in Tanintharyi in the South.",
      "Photos on social media showed demonstrators carrying flowers, birthday cakes and posters of Suu Kyi, as well as banners reading \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d and urging supporters to strive for \"the liberation of the entire nation, including Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\u201d",
      "The military government's supporters posted calls for the arrest of protesters.",
      "Several Western embassies posted pictures and illustrations on social media of red roses, with some issuing statements calling for Suu Kyi and all other political prisoners to be released.",
      "The Suu Foundation, a nonprofit humanitarian organization, and the law firm Zimeray & Finelle said in a joint statement Thursday that Suu Kyi was thought to have suffered an injury to her left arm during the 7.7 magnitude earthquake that hit the country in March.",

      "For two days, the brown bear ambled through the neighborhoods of Vilnius, trotted across highways and explored backyards \u2014 all while being chased by onlookers with smartphones and, eventually, drones.",
      "The government then issued a permit for the bear to be shot and killed.",
      "That did not go down well with Lithuania's hunters who, aware that there is only a tiny number of the protected species in the entire country, refused.",
      "The Lithuanian Association of Hunters and Fishermen said it was shocked by the government order.",
      "The association's administrator, Ramut\u0117 Juknyt\u0117, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the bear was a beautiful young female who was about 2 years old and did not deserve to be shot. \u201cShe was scared but not aggressive. She just didn\u2019t know how to escape the city but she didn\u2019t do anything bad,\u201d he said.",

      "The drama began on Saturday when the bear entered the capital. It was the first time in many years that a bear had entered the city and it became a national story. The animal came within about 4-5 kilometers (about 2-3 miles) of the city center.",
      "Since causing a stir with their permit to kill the bear, Lithuanian authorities have been on the defensive.",
      "Deputy Environment Minister Ram\u016bnas Krugelis said that a kill permit was issued purely as a precaution in case the bear posed a threat, according to a report by the Lithuanian broadcaster LRT.",
      "The hunters proposed a more humane approach: sedation, tracking and relocation.",
      "As the debate over the bear's fate unfolded, she took matters into her own paws and wandered out of the city.",
      "Juknyt\u0117 said that the bear was recorded by a camera on Wednesday, peacefully wandering through a forest some 60 kilometers (40 miles) from Vilnius while munching on corn.",
      "Brown bears are native to the region and were once common. They were wiped out in Lithuania in the 19th century due to hunting and habitat loss.",
      "In recent years they have started reappearing in small numbers, typically wandering in from neighboring countries like Latvia and Belarus, where small bear populations still exist. Bears are protected under Lithuanian and EU law as they are considered a rare and vulnerable species in the region.",

      "BANGKOK -- Thailand\u2019s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra faced growing calls for her resignation in a deepening political crisis set off by a leaked recording of her negotiating with Cambodia's former leader in the two nations' latest border dispute.",
      "Paetongtarn apologized to the public on Thursday, after a major coalition partner used the leaked phone call to pull out of the fragile government led by her Pheu Thai Party. Paetongtarn has already been criticized for a perceived soft stance toward Cambodia, especially by right-wing nationalists who are longtime foes of her father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.",
      "The latest border dispute involved an armed confrontation May 28 in a relatively small no-man\u2019- land both countries claim in which one Cambodian soldier was killed.",
      "Cambodia\u2019s Senate President Hun Sen posted the full, 17-minute phone call on his Facebook page after a shorter version was leaked Wednesday. He said he recorded the conversation \u201cto avoid any misunderstanding or misrepresentation in official matters,\u201d adding that he shared the recording with at least 80 people.",
      "In the recording, Paetongtarn was heard calling Hun Sen \u201cuncle\u201d as they discussed through translators whether they should lift border restrictions imposed after the deadly clash. Backlash revolved around her calling a Thai army commander in charge of the border area where the clash happened as \u201can opponent.\u201d Critics said she was trying to please Hun Sen too much and made Thailand look weak.",
      "Paetongtarn said her comments were a negotiation tactic and that her goal was to bring peace between the countries.",
      "However, she said she would no longer engage in a private talk with Hun Sen as she could not trust him. \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that all that he cares about is his popularity in the country, without considering impacts on relations with other countries,\u201d she said.",
      "Thailand's Foreign Affairs Ministry said it submitted a protest letter over the leaked recording with the Cambodian ambassador, saying that Cambodia\u2019s actions were unacceptable and \u201ca breach of diplomatic etiquette, a serious violation of trust, and undermines conduct between two neighboring countries.\u201d",
      "Paetongtarn has described the two families as having close, longtime relationships. Her father Thaksin and Hun Sen reportedly regard each other as \u201cgodbrothers.\u201d In 2009, Hun Sen appointed Thaksin as a Cambodian government adviser, but Thaksin soon resigned the position.",
      "Hours after the leak, the Bhumjaithai party, the biggest partner in Paetongtarn\u2019s ruling coalition, said it would quit because of the leaked phone call. The party's statement said the recording \u201cposed an impact on Thailand\u2019s sovereignty, territory, interests and the army.\u201d The party called for Paetongtarn to take responsibility for the damage, although they did not say how.",
      "There has already been a rift between Bhumjaithai and Pheu Thai over reports that the former would be shuffled out of the powerful Interior Ministry. Several Bhumjaithai leaders are also under investigation over the alleged rigging of the Senate election in which many figures who are reportedly close to the party claimed a majority of seats.",

      "Opposition leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut of the People\u2019s Party on Thursday called for Paetongtarn to dissolve Parliament and hold a new election. He said the leaked phone call was \u201cthe last straw\u201d that destroyed people's faith in her administration.",
      "Dozens of nationalists protesters gathered near the Government House on Thursday, holding Thai national flags and signs calling for Paetongtarn to resign. Some senators said they will file a motion to impeach her, and several other individuals also filed complaints over the matter to law enforcement agencies.",
      "People have also expressed concern that Paetongtarn\u2019s comment towards the local army commander could potentially lead to a military coup. Her father, Thaksin, was ousted in a coup in 2006, and Thaksin\u2019s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, became prime minister in 2011 and was also toppled by the military in 2014.",
      "The military said in a statement Thursday that it would like the people to \u201cmaintain confidence in the Royal Thai Army\u2019s steadfast commitment to constitutional monarchy and its readiness to execute its constitutional mandate of protecting national sovereignty through established legal frameworks and institutional mechanisms.\"",

      "South Africa has opened a new inquiry into the killings of four anti-apartheid activists 40 years ago",
      "JOHANNESBURG -- When Nombuyiselo Mhlauli was given her husband's body back for burial, he had more than 25 stab wounds in his chest and seven in his back, with a gash across his throat. His right hand was missing.",
      "Sicelo Mhlauli was one of four Black men abducted, tortured and killed 40 years ago this month by apartheid-era security forces in South Africa. No one has been held accountable for their deaths.",
      "But a new judge-led inquiry into the killings of the anti-apartheid activists who became known as the Cradock Four \u2014 and who became a rallying cry for those denied justice \u2014 opened this month.",
      "It is part of a renewed push for the truth by relatives of some of the thousands of people killed by police and others during the years of white minority rule and enforced racial segregation.",
      "Mhlauli described the state of her husband's body during testimony she gave at the start of the inquiry in the city of Gqeberha, near where the Cradock Four were abducted in June 1985. Relatives of some of the three other men also testified.",
      "Thumani Calata never got to know her father, Fort Calata, who had been a teacher. She was born two weeks after the funerals of the Cradock Four, which drew huge crowds and galvanized resistance to apartheid.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how it feels, and I will never know how it feels, to be hugged by my dad,\u201d Thumani Calata, now 39, told the inquiry as she wept.",
      "Two previous inquiries were held during apartheid. A two-year inquest that started in 1987 found the men were killed by unknown people. Another in 1993 said they were killed by unnamed policemen.",
      "Relatives of the Cradock Four likely will never see justice. The six former police officers directly implicated in the abductions and killings have died, the last one in 2023. None was prosecuted despite the post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission identifying them and denying them amnesty in the late 1990s.",
      "That commission, set up by then-President Nelson Mandela, attempted to confront the atrocities of apartheid in the years after the system officially ended in 1994. While some killers were granted amnesty, more than 5,000 applications were refused and recommended for criminal investigation.",
      "Hardly any made it to court.",
      "Oscar van Heerden, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg, said the bitter emotion of relatives at the Cradock Four inquiry showed wounds have not healed.",
      "\u201cWhere it was felt that truth was not spoken and there wasn\u2019t sufficient evidence to warrant forgiveness, those were cases that were supposed to be formally charged, prosecuted and justice should have prevailed,\" van Heerden said. \"None of that happened.\u201d",
      "The failure by post-apartheid governments for 25 years to pursue cases is now being scrutinized. Frustrated, the families of the Cradock Four finally forced authorities to rule last year that there would be a new inquiry into the killings.",
      "They also joined with a group of relatives of other apartheid-era victims to take the South African government to court this year over the failure to investigate so many crimes.",
      "As part of the settlement in that case, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa ordered a national inquiry led by a retired judge into why apartheid-era killers were not brought to justice. The inquiry, which has not opened yet, threatens to expose further uncomfortable moments for South Africa.",
      "While the majority of victims of political violence during apartheid were Black and other people of color, some were white, and families have come together across racial lines. A group of survivors and relatives from the 1993 Highgate Hotel massacre, where unknown men opened fire in a bar full of white customers, joined with the Cradock Four families and others in the case against the government.",
      "They allege that post-apartheid authorities deliberately blocked investigations.",
      "Other inquests have been reopened, including one into the 1967 death of Albert Luthuli, who was president of the banned anti-apartheid African National Congress movement when he was hit by a train. Luthuli's death has been viewed with suspicion for more than 50 years.",
      "At the Cradock Four inquiry, which is expected to resume in October for more testimony, Howard Varney, a lawyer for the families, said this is their last chance to know the truth.",
      "The new inquiry has attempted to retrace the killings, from the moment of the men's abduction at a nighttime police roadblock to the time their bodies were discovered, burned and with signs of torture. The families also want a former military commander and ex-police officers who may have knowledge of the killings to testify.",
      "Lukhanyo Calata, the son of Fort Calata, said he accepted it was unlikely anyone would ever be prosecuted over the death of his father and his friends Mhlauli, Matthew Goniwe and Sparrow Mkonto. But he said he wants official records to finally show who killed them.",
      "\u201cJustice now can really only come in the form of truth,\u201d Lukhanyo Calata told The Associated Press. \u201cThey may not have been prosecuted, they may not have been convicted, but according to court records, this is the truth around the murders of the Cradock Four.\u201d",

      "Super-tight security is smothering The Hague around a summit of NATO leaders next week",
      "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Locals, art lovers and diplomats like to meet over a meal and a drink in the historic Gastrobar Berlage behind a landmark art museum in The Hague.",
      "But the usual stream of visitors turned into a trickle when fences started rising outside as part of super-tight security around a meeting of NATO leaders that is smothering the Dutch city in a massive military and police operation called Orange Shield.",
      "Parts of the usually laid-back city, where NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte used to ride his bicycle to work while munching on an apple when he was prime minister of the Netherlands, are turning into a military fortress.",
      "\u201cIt's dead,\u201d Berlage owner Bianca Veenhof said as she looked at an almost empty terrace at the start of what should have been Wednesday's lunchtime rush.",
      "Parking spots have been blocked off by freshly installed security fencing, workers in nearby offices have been told to stay home and public transit lines near the grounds have been diverted.",
      "The city that markets itself as the global hub of peace and justice because of the international courts it hosts is turning into a city of security and inconvenience for the June 24-25 meeting that is scheduled to feature leaders of the 32-nation alliance, including U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "The summit comes as global geopolitical tensions soar and conflict escalates in the Middle East.",
      "In what they are calling the biggest security operation ever staged in the Netherlands, authorities are locking down parts of the city, closing off roads, and shutting down airspace.",
      "Temporary barricades and metal mesh fences surrounding the World Forum summit venue are just a fraction of the measures that radiate out from The Hague.",

      "Military police will protect delegations. Frigates will patrol the North Sea, F-35 fighter jets and Apache helicopters will take to the skies and air defense systems will be on alert. Bomb squads will comb the venue for explosives.",
      "Convoys carrying leaders will be whisked with military police escorts along closed-off highways from airports to their accommodations. While civilian drones are banned from the airspace around the summit and other key locations, police and military drones will buzz around the skies over the summit venue and other locations where leaders gather.",

      "Hurricane Erick has made landfall in western Oaxaca state in Mexico",
      "PUERTO ESCONDIDO, Mexico -- Powerful Hurricane Erick made landfall in Mexico's western state of Oaxaca early Thursday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.",
      "The hurricane's center was located about 20 miles (30 kilometers) east of Punta Maldonado. Its maximum sustained winds were clocked at 125 mph (205 kph). It was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph), the hurricane center said.",
      "The storm was downgraded slightly before making landfall, from a powerful Category 4 to a Category 3. While slightly reduced in power, Erick is still considered a major hurricane as a Category 3, which can carry winds of up to 129 mph (210 kph).",
      "The storm threaded the needle between the resorts of Acapulco and Puerto Escondido, tearing into a sparsely populated stretch of coastline near the border of Oaxaca and Guerrero states. Agricultural fields blanket the low-lying coastal area between small fishing villages.",
      "Erick is expected to rapidly weaken as it crashes into the coastal mountains of southern Mexico, and the system is likely to dissipate late Thursday or early Friday, the hurricane center said.",
      "The storm threatened to unleash destructive winds near where the eye crashes ashore, flash floods and a dangerous storm surge, forecasters said.",
      "At first light Thursday, Acapulco awoke under ominous dark clouds, but without a drop of rain and small waves lapping at its central beach.",
      "However, the storm was forecast to move northwest just inland up the coast through midday, bringing heavy rain to the resort and the mountains that tower dramatically above it.",
      "Still, it appeared Acapulco had dodged the worst at least in terms of Erick's strong winds.",
      "Late Wednesday, Erick's projected path had crept south, closer to the resort city of Puerto Escondido in Oaxaca state with Acapulco up the coast to the northwest.",
      "President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a video message Wednesday night that all activities in the region were suspended and she urged people to stay in their homes or to move to shelters if they lived in low-lying areas.",
      "Waves were crashing onto the esplanade in Puerto Escondido by nightfall, swamping wooden fishing boats that had been pulled up there for safety. The beach disappeared under pounding waves and the rising tide had already reached the interiors of some waterfront restaurants.",
      "Last-minute purchases ended at nightfall as stores closed and the streets emptied.",
      "Earlier in the day, fishermen in Puerto Escondido pulled their boats out of the water ahead of the storm's arrival. Some surfers continued to ride waves at the Zicatela beach, even with red flags up to warn people to stay out of the water.",
      "Acapulco residents had braced for Erick\u2019s arrival with more preparation and trepidation because of the memory of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Otis two years earlier.",
      "The city of nearly 1 million was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort\u2019s hotels.",
      "Guerrero state Gov. Evelyn Salgado said via X that all movement in Acapulco and other beach communities was to be suspended at 8 p.m. Wednesday. Schools across the state were to remain closed for a second day Thursday.",
      "Carlos Ozuna Romero, 51, lost his restaurant at the edge of an Acapulco beach when Otis slammed the resort with devastating winds. On Wednesday, he directed workers storing tables and chairs.",
      "\u201cAuthorities\u2019 warnings fill us with fear and obviously make us remember everything we\u2019ve already been through,\u201d Ozuna Romero said in reference to Otis.",
      "Elsewhere, workers nailed sheets of plywood over shop windows and stacked sandbags outside doorways. Cars lined up to fill their tanks and shoppers made last-minute purchases before rushing home.",
      "Ver\u00f3nica G\u00f3mez struggled through the streets of Acapulco with a large jug of water. \u201cWe\u2019re all afraid because we think the same thing could happen,\u201d said the 40-year-old employee of a shipping company.",
      "But she said she and others learned a lot from Otis. \u201cNow it\u2019s not going to catch us by surprise,\" she said, holding out a bag of canned food as evidence.",
      "In Acapulco on Wednesday, there was a strong presence of National Guard and police in the streets, but most visible were trucks from the national power company. Crews worked to clear drainage canals and brush.",
      "Forecasters expected Erick to lash Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast with heavy rain, strong winds and a fierce storm surge. Rains of up to 16 inches (40 centimeters) could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lesser totals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the center\u2019s advisory said. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.",
      "Laura Vel\u00e1zquez, Mexico\u2019s national civil defense coordinator, said Erick was forecast to bring \u201ctorrential\u201d rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides with numerous rivers at risk of flooding.",
      "Acapulco\u2019s port closed Tuesday evening. Salgado said 582 shelters were set to receive people who might evacuate their homes across Guerrero.",
      "Having doubled in strength in less than a day, Erick churned through an ideal environment for quick intensification. Last year, there were 34 incidents of rapid intensification \u2014 when a storm gains at least 35 mph in 24 hours \u2014 which is about twice as many as average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the hurricane center.",

      "Critics feared it would politicize the judiciary and offer organized crime an easier to influencing judicial decisions. Mexico's governing Morena party was poised to gain control of the Supreme Court as a majority of the winners had strong ties to the party or were aligned ideologically.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand has suspended millions of dollars in funding to the Cook Islands over the \u201cbreadth and content\u201d of agreements the smaller Pacific nation has made with China, officials said Thursday.",
      "Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who is on his first official visit to China, said the Cook Islands had not been transparent and open about its comprehensive strategic partnership with China.",
      "\"We\u2019ve suspended some of the aid money until we can get clarity on those issues,\u201d he said in Shanghai.",
      "Relations between the smaller Pacific island nations and their regional backers Australia and New Zealand have stumbled in recent years as Beijing vies to increase its sway in the region. The latest move by New Zealand was striking because it reflects growing friction between two countries with strong constitutional ties over their diverging approaches to managing relations with Beijing. Cook Islands is self-governing but shares a military and passports with New Zealand.",
      "Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown told lawmakers in Parliament on Thursday that the funding was \u201cnot halted, it\u2019s paused\u201d and downplayed the significance of the amount frozen. New Zealand is the biggest funder for the Cook Islands.",
      "News of the 18.2 million New Zealand dollar ($11 million) funding halt only emerged when a Cook Islands news outlet saw its brief mention in a government budget document. It's likely to prove difficult for Luxon, who is due to meet President Xi Jinping this week.",
      "Beijing, which said in February that the deals were not intended to antagonize New Zealand, defended its partnership with the country of 15 islands and 15,000 people.",
      "\u201cBoth New Zealand and the Cook Islands are important partners of China,\u201d Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in Beijing. \u201cChina-Cook Islands cooperation targets no third party, nor should it be interfered with or constrained by any third party.\u201d",
      "In a report tabled in the Cook Islands Parliament this week, the Public Accounts Committee registered \u201cconcern\u201d about a reduction of 10 million New Zealand dollars ($6 million) in the government's purse, the first known mention of the finance freeze. The money was earmarked for \u201ccore sector support\u201d, which funds the Cook Islands' health, education and tourism sectors, with audits by Wellington on how it's spent.",
      "The money is part of NZ $200 million directed to the Cook Islands by New Zealand over the past three years as part of an almost 60-year-old free association compact. The links demand consultation by Cook Islands leaders with Wellington on agreements with other countries that might affect New Zealand.",
      "The pacts with China were the first serious test of those rules.",
      "The Cook Islands has a large and lucrative exclusive economic zone, with Brown's government exploring prospects for deep sea mining activity. Cook Islanders can freely live and work in New Zealand, which prompted alarm about national security in Wellington when officials learned of the raft of agreements Brown signed in February.",
      "The agreements didn't promise security cooperation between Beijing and Cook Islands, but they did pledge more funding from China for infrastructure projects and educational scholarships. Not all of the documents Brown signed were released publicly.",
      "The spokesperson for New Zealand Foreign Minister Peters said Thursday said the agreements illustrated \u201ca gap in understanding\u201d between the governments \u201cabout what our special relationship of free association requires,\u201d which included consultation to ensure the preservation of shared interests.",
      "The \u201cbreadth and content\u201d of the deals and lack of consultation with Wellington about them prompted a review of funding to the Cook Islands, Peters' office said.",
      "\u201cNew Zealand has therefore paused these payments and will also not consider significant new funding until the Cook Islands Government takes concrete steps to repair the relationship and restore trust,\u201d the spokesperson's statement said.",
      "Brown said in February that the deals did not \u201creplace our longstanding relationships with New Zealand, Australia and others, but rather complements them, ensuring that we have a diversified portfolio of partnerships.\u201d News of the agreements prompted protests in the capital, Avarua, led by opposition lawmakers.",
      "On Thursday, Brown made a pointed reference to Luxon\u2019s China visit, highlighting the New Zealand leader's announcements of increased trade with Beijing and looser visa requirements for Chinese travelers. The Cook Islands leader said he trusted any agreements Luxon made in Beijing would \u201cpose no security threat to the people of the Cook Islands\u201d despite his government not knowing their content.",
      "New Zealand's latest action was an \u201centirely avoidable consequence of Cook Islands\u2019 strategic flirtations with China,\u201d said Mihai Sora, analyst with the Australia-based thinktank Lowy Institute.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit cute to sign up to a comprehensive strategic partnership with China in 2025 and pretend there is no strategic angle for Beijing, given all the mounting evidence of China\u2019s malign strategic intent in the Pacific,\u201d he said.",

      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil\u2019s federal police accused former president Jair Bolsonaro and 35 others of involvement in a sprawling scheme that used the country\u2019s intelligence agency to spy on members of the judiciary, lawmakers and journalists. The seal on the 1,125-page document, which adds to the far-right leader's woes, was lifted by the country's Supreme Court on Wednesday.",
      "The federal police document said Bolsonaro was both aware of the scheme and its main beneficiary. Investigator Daniel Carvalho Brasil Nascimento, who chairs the probe, named one of the former president's sons, Rio de Janeiro councilor Carlos Bolsonaro, as a key plot member. The police investigation focuses on a so-called parallel structure in Brazil\u2019s intelligence agency.",
      "\u201c(Bolsonaro and Carlos) were responsible for the definitions of the criminal organization's strategic guidelines, for choosing the targets of the clandestine actions (against opponents, institutions, the electoral system) so they would politically gain from these operations,\u201d the federal police said. \u201cThey are the decision center and the main recipients of illicit advantages.\u201d",
      "Bolsonaro, who governed between 2019 and 2022 and is already barred by Brazil's electoral court from running in next year's elections, is standing on trial over allegations that he attempted a coup to stay in office despite his 2022 defeat to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. He denies any wrongdoing and claims he is being politically persecuted.",
      "One of the counts Bolsonaro will be sentenced on in the coup case is precisely on leading a criminal organization, which stopped federal police from requesting the same for the accusations revealed on Wednesday, as both investigations entwine.",
      "\u201cIf he were accused again for the same facts, this would most likely come up against a prohibition called prohibition obis in idem, a Latin formula that means double punishment or double accusation for the same act,\u201d said Jo\u00e3o Pedro Padua, a law professor at the Fluminense Federal University.",
      "The evidence revealed on Wednesday can still be used in the coup probe.",
      "Celso Vilardi, a lawyer for Bolsonaro, told the The Associated Press he was yet to analyze the federal police report and its accusations against his client.",
      "Brazil's federal police also accused Luiz Fernando Corr\u00eaa, the head of the country's intelligence agency under Lula, of undue interference in investigations. On Tuesday, staffers of the agency issued a statement to push for Corr\u00eaa's resignation. He did not respond a request for comment.",
      "Brazil's Supreme Court will hand the police investigation to Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet, who will decide whether the investigation will be taken to the Supreme Court for trial.",
      "Last year, police arrested five people in connection with the case, under the suspicion that the Brazilian intelligence agency was being misused.",

      "One of the confirmed deaths is that of a 54-year-old woman in the municipality of Candelaria. Her husband is missing. Preliminary reports indicate that the couple attempted to cross a flooded area in a vehicle in the and were swept away, the civil defense agency said.",

      "The mummy had gone unnoticed despite urban development in a district of Lima where former agricultural fields have been converted into working-class neighborhoods in recent decades.

      "Tinubu visited Benue state, the site of the recent deadly attacks, seeking to calm tensions and promise justice for the victims. \u201cWe will restore peace, rebuild, and bring the perpetrators to justice. You are not alone.\u201d the Nigerian leader said on X.",

      "Doubling in strength in less than a day and expected to further grow further, Hurricane Erick is chugging through the ideal environment to power up quickly as it approaches Mexico's southern Pacific Coast",
      "WASHINGTON -- Having doubled in strength in less than a day and still expected to grow further, Hurricane Erick on Wednesday chugged through the ideal environment to power up quickly as it approached Mexico's southern Pacific Coast.",
      "This type of rapid intensification has become more common in a warmer climate, especially in the Atlantic and near the United States, which is not where Erick is now, scientists said. Last year, there were 34 incidents of rapid intensification \u2014 when a storm gains at least 35 mph in 24 hours \u2014 which is about twice as many as average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the National Hurricane Center.",
      "Erick, an otherwise run-of-the-mill hurricane that\u2019s strong but not unusual, gained 50 mph in just 18 hours and was still powering up as it neared the coast.",
      "The only thing that\u2019s unusual so far is that this is the fifth eastern Pacific storm a month into the season there, which is a little more active than normal, said University of Miami hurricane researcher Brian McNoldy. And it\u2019s likely that when Erick hits, it will be the strongest storm to make landfall in that part of Mexico this early in the season, he said.",
      "On average, the fifth named storm first appears in the Eastern Pacific basin around July 23, according to the hurricane center. The Eastern Pacific hurricane season, which starts May 15 and runs through Nov. 30, averages 15 named storms, eight of which become hurricanes with four of those reaching major status of winds more than 110 mph (177 kph). In general, the eastern Pacific tends to have about one storm a year more than the Atlantic. But Atlantic storms tend to cause more destruction because they hit more populated areas.",
      "Because of where Erik is headed \u2014 nearing Acapulco \u2014 and its rapid intensification, the storm brings back bad memories of deadly Otis, which seemed to come from out of nowhere to smack Mexico with a top-of-the-scale Category 5 hurricane in 2023. But Erick is no Otis, especially because of their timing. Erick is an early-season storm and Otis hit in October.",
      "Forming in October, Otis grew stronger by churning up deeper and warmer water because it was later in the year. Erick is early in the year and the deep water it would churn up is cooler and doesn't fuel rapid intensification. Even so, the surface water is plenty hot enough, said MIT hurricane scientist Kerry Emanuel.",
      "All the ingredients are otherwise perfect for Erick's power-up, said University at Albany atmospheric scientist Kristen Corbosiero. Dry air often stops rapid intensification, but Erick hasn't run into dry air and the atmosphere around it is extremely moist, she said. It's got a good stormy eye forming and has what would be the ideal shape of a strengthening storm, she said.",
      "Studies have linked human-caused climate change in general to more bouts of rapid intensification, as well as wetter and slower storms, Corbosiero said. But it would take more study, usually after the storm hits, to find any potential link between global warming and Erick in particular, if there is one, she said.",

      "MADRID -- Spain has rejected a NATO proposal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense needs that\u2019s due to be announced next week, calling it \u201cunreasonable.\u201d",
      "Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, in a letter sent on Thursday to NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, said that Spain \u201ccannot commit to a specific spending target in terms of GDP\u201d at next week\u2019s NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands.",
      "Most U.S. allies in NATO are on track to endorse U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demand that they invest 5% of GDP on their defense and military needs. In early June, Sweden and the Netherlands said that they aim to meet the new target.",
      "A NATO official on Thursday said that discussions between allies were ongoing about a new defense spending plan.",
      "\u201cFor Spain, committing to a 5% target would not only be unreasonable, but also counterproductive, as it would move Spain away from optimal spending and it would hinder the EU\u2019s ongoing efforts to strengthen its security and defense ecosystem,\u201d S\u00e1nchez wrote in the letter seen by The Associated Press.",
      "Spain was the lowest spender in the 32-nation military alliance last year, directing less than 2% of its GDP on defense expenditure.",
      "S\u00e1nchez said in April that the government would raise defense spending by 10.5 billion euros ($12 billion) in 2025 to reach NATO\u2019s previous target of 2% of GDP.",
      "On Thursday, S\u00e1nchez called for \u201ca more flexible formula\u201d in relation to a new spending target \u2014 one that either made it optional or left Spain out of its application.",
      "S\u00e1nchez wrote that the country is \u201cfully committed to NATO,\" but that meeting a 5% target \u201cwould be incompatible with our welfare state and our world vision.\" He said that doing so would require cutting public services and scaling back other spending, including toward the green transition.",
      "Instead, Spain will need to spend 2.1% of GDP to meet the Spanish military\u2019s estimated defense needs, S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "At home, corruption scandals that have ensnared S\u00e1nchez's inner circle and family members have put the Spanish leader under increasing pressure to call an early election, even from some allies. In April, when S\u00e1nchez announced that Spain would reach NATO's previous 2% spending target, the move angered some coalition members further to the left of his Socialist Party.",
      "NATO allies agreed to spend 2% of GDP on military expenditure after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022. But the alliance's plans for defending Europe and North America against a Russian attack require investments of at least 3%.",
      "The aim now is to raise the bar to 3.5% for core defense spending on tanks, warplanes, air defense, missiles and hiring extra troops. A further 1.5% would be spent on things like roads, bridges, ports and airfields so armies can deploy more quickly, as well as preparing societies for possible attack.",
      "Rutte had been due to table a new proposal on Friday aimed at satisfying Spain. European allies and Canada are keen to finalize the spending pledge before the summit, and not leave it open for any heated debate that might drag the meeting out.",
      "Poland and the Baltic countries \u2014 Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 have already publicly committed to 5%, and Rutte has said that most allies were ready to endorse the goal.",
      "But Spain isn't alone among NATO's low spenders. Belgium, Canada and Italy will also struggle to hike security spending by billions of dollars.",
      "A big question still to be answered is what time frame countries will be given to reach an agreed-upon new spending goal.",
      "A target date of 2032 was initially floated, but Rutte has said that Russia could be ready to launch an attack on NATO territory by 2030.",

      "MILAN -- Global sales of personal luxury goods are \u201dslowing down but not collapsing,\u201d according to a Bain & Co. consultancy study released Thursday.",
      "Personal luxury goods sales that eroded to 364 billion euros ($419 billion) in 2024 are projected to slide by another 2% to 5% this year, the study said, citing threats of U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions triggering economic slowdowns.",

      "Alongside external headwinds, luxury brands have alienated consumers with an ongoing creativity crisis and sharp price increases, Bain said. Buyers have also been turned off by recent investigations in Italy that revealed that sweatshop conditions in subcontractors making luxury handbags.",
      "Sales are slipping sharply in powerhouse markets the United States and China, the study showed. In the U.S., market volatility due to tariffs has discouraged consumer confidence. China has recorded six quarters of contraction on low consumer confidence.",
      "The Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia are recording growth. Europe is mostly flat, the study showed.",
      "This has created a sharp divergence between brands that continue with strong creative and earnings growth, such as the Prada Group, which posted a 13% first-quarter jump in revenue to 1.34 billion euros, and brands like Gucci, where revenue was down 24% to 1.6 billion euros in the same period.",
      "Gucci owner Kering last week hired Italian automotive executive Luca De Meo, the former CEO of Renault, to mount a turnaround. The decision comes as three of its brands \u2014 Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta \u2014 are launching new creative directors.",
      "Kering\u2019s stock surged 12% on news of the appointment. D\u2019Arpizio underlined his track record, returning French carmaker Renault to profitability and previous roles as marketing director at Volkswagen and Fiat.",
      "\u201cAll of these factors resonate well together in a market like luxury when you are in a phase where growth is still the name of the game, but you also need to make the company more nimble in terms of costs, and turn around some of the brands,\u2019\u2019 she said.",
      "Brands are also making changes to minimize the impact of possible U.S. tariffs. These include shipping directly from production sites and not warehouses and reducing stock in stores.",
      "With aesthetic changes afoot \u201cstuffing the channels doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense,\u2019\u2019 D\u2019Arpizio said.",
      "Still, many of the headwinds buffering the sector are out of companies\u2019 control.",
      "\u201cMany of these (negative) aspects are not going to change soon. What can change is more clarity on the tariffs, but I don\u2019t think we will stop the wars or the political instability in a few months,\u2019\u2019 she said, adding that luxury consumer confidence is tied more closely to stock market trends than geopolitics.",
      "President of Italian luxury brand association Altagamma Matteo Lunelli underlined hat the sector recorded overall growth of 28% from 2019-2024, \u201cplacing us well above pre-pandemic levels.\u201d",
      "While luxury spending is sensitive to global turmoil, it is historically quick to rebound, powered by new markets and pent-up demand.",
      "The 2008-2009 financial crisis plummeted sales of luxury apparel, handbags and footwear from 161 billion euros to 147 billion euros over two years. The market more than recovered the losses in 2010 as it rebounded by 14%, with an acceleration in the Chinese market. Similarly, after sales plunged by 21% during the pandemic, pent-up spending powered sales to new records.",

The 23-year-old tanker ADALYNN belonged to a so-called Russian \u201cshadow fleet\u201d \u2013 known to operate older ships below basic security standards \u2013 and may have been carrying around 70,000 tons of crude oil, the group said.",

      "The hackers group, Gonjeshke Darande \u2014 \u201cPredatory Sparrow\u201d in Farsi \u2014 accused Nobitex of having helped Iran\u2019s government to evade Western sanctions over the country's rapidly advancing nuclear program and transfer money to militants, in a post on X claiming the attack.",
      "Nobitex appeared to have confirmed the attack. Its app and website were down as it assessed \u201cunauthorized access\u201d to its systems, it said in a post on X.",
      "The theft spanned a range of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and more, said head of national security intelligence at Chainalysis Andrew Fierman. The breach is \u201cparticularly significant given the comparatively modest size of Iran's cryptocurrency market,\u201d he added.",
      "The hack appears to be motivated by escalating tensions in the Israel-Iran conflict, which broke out last week when Israel struck Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and military officials, drawing Tehran\u2019s response with barrages of missiles. It came after the group said it had destroyed data in a cyberattack against Iran\u2019s state-controlled Bank Sepah on Tuesday.",
      "Elliptic said that relatives of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei were linked to the exchange and that sanctioned Revolutionary Guard operatives had used Nobitex. It shared evidence that the exchange had sent and received funds from cryptocurrency wallets controlled by Iranian allies including Yemen\u2019s Houthis and Hamas.",
      "Gonjeshke Darande has previously claimed responsibility for other high-level cyberattacks against Iran, including a 2021 operation that paralyzed gas stations and a 2022 effort against a steel mill that sparked a large fire.",
      "Israeli media have widely reported that Gonjeshke Darande is linked to Israel but the country\u2019s government has never officially acknowledged ties to the group.",
      "U.S. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Angus King last year raised concerns about Iran\u2019s use of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions.",

      "The SNB attributed the drop in inflation in Switzerland primarily to declining prices in the tourism and oil sectors. It's now projecting annual inflation at 0.2% this year, before edging up to a half-point next year and 0.7% in 2027, based on the scenario that its target interest rate will remain at zero over that span.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The Buss family's decision to sell a controlling stake in the Los Angeles Lakers at an eye-popping franchise valuation of $10 billion marks the end of nearly a half-century when one of the most valuable properties in the sports world was run by an eccentric father and his sometimes squabbling children.",
      "With high-living playboy Jerry Buss and current team governor Jeanie Buss in charge, the glamorous Lakers essentially have been the professional sports equivalent of a quirky family business for two generations.",
      "Sports became increasingly corporate and monolithic in the 21st century while franchise values skyrocketed and ever-more-wealthy titans seized control of this perpetual growth industry.",
      "Just not around Hollywood's favorite basketball team, with its gold uniforms and 17 golden trophies.",
      "\u201cThe majority of businesses in this country are family-owned businesses,\u201d Jeanie Buss told NPR earlier this year in a rare interview to promote a Netflix comedy series based on her career. \u201cAnd everybody has a family. If you\u2019re in business with them, (disagreements) happen. But at the end of the day, what brings you together is the team or the business, and you want to build something successful.\u201d",
      "The Lakers and the Buss clan have been inextricable since 1979 \u2014 the longest active ownership tenure in the NBA \u2014 but Mark Walter's stunning sports coup Wednesday effectively ends this improbable era. A person with knowledge of the agreement confirmed it to The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity because neither side immediately announced the deal.",
      "The sale should make an extraordinarily wealthy woman of Jeanie Buss, one of Jerry\u2019s seven acknowledged children and a longtime employee of his various sporting concerns.",
      "And that's the biggest reason many Lakers fans are rejoicing: This lavish sale comes with the knowledge that the buyers have exponentially more resources than the Buss family \u2014 and Walter has showed he knows how to spend it intelligently.",
      "Walter, who heads a group that already bought 27% of the Lakers in 2021, has a sterling reputation in Southern California for his group's stewardship of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The iconic baseball team has become a perpetual World Series contender with bold, aggressive financial moves grounded in smart organizational planning ever since Walter's firm, Guggenheim Partners, paid $2 billion to wrest the Dodgers from the reviled Frank McCourt in 2012.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really committed to the city of Los Angeles in various ways, and sports is something that he\u2019s very passionate about, and certainly Los Angeles sports,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"Speaking (as) a Dodger employee, he\u2019s very competitive and he\u2019s going to do everything he can to produce a championship-caliber team every single year and make sure the city feels proud about the Lakers and the legacy that they\u2019ve already built with the Buss family.\u201d",
      "In the Buss era, the Lakers could sell prospective players on their trophies, sunny Los Angeles and that family-business intimacy. While that was enough to win big in most decades, Walter\u2019s group epitomizes the modern, deep-pocketed approach to building a consistent championship contender. Guggenheim Partners reportedly has $325 billion under management, with Walter particularly leveraging insurance investments to pursue gains across the breadth of the sports world.",
      "\u201cHe does everything he can to provide resources, support,\" Roberts said. \u201cHe wants to win. He feels that the fans, the city, deserve that. I think that that\u2019s never lost, and it\u2019s more of challenging us always. How do we become better and not complacent or stagnant, to continue to stay current with the market, the competition to win?\u201d",
      "Before this sale, the Buss siblings were not thought to be particularly wealthy, at least not by team owner standards. Jeanie Buss occasionally appeared to balk at writing certain checks \u2014 ask any Lakers fan about Alex Caruso's departure \u2014 and the team's front office and infrastructure are thought to be on the NBA's smaller side.",
      "The new ownership group's wealth could knock down some financial barriers in the restrictive, apron era of salary cap management. It definitely will provide the Lakers with every resource in scouting, player development and any other competitive avenue to assemble a team commensurate with the Lakers' brand.",
      "\u201cI know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss,\u201d Magic Johnson wrote on social media. \u201cNow she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She\u2019s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans!\u201d",
      "There is a familial symmetry to these two transactions 46 years apart: Jerry Buss got a steal when he bought the Lakers, and his kids might end up with the wealthiest deal in sports history when they sell.",
      "Jerry Buss was a chemist and USC instructor who heavily leveraged his real estate investments to buy the Lakers, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum arena and a large ranch from Jack Kent Cooke for $67.5 million. Buss loved a good time almost as much as he loved basketball, and he built the Showtime era of Lakers basketball on Magic and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, but also on his own undeniable charisma and hunger for titles.",
      "Buss and his front offices then landed Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant in the 1990s, ushering in a second championship era. All told, the Lakers reached the NBA Finals in 16 of Jerry Buss' 34 seasons as their primary owner, winning a whopping 10 championships.",
      "Jeanie Buss succeeded her father as the Lakers\u2019 governor upon his death in 2013. Her brother, Jim, was the Lakers' head of basketball operations until Jeanie fired him in February 2017 and installed Johnson and Rob Pelinka, Bryant's former agent. Pelinka gradually took over basketball operations and presided over a string of Lakers-worthy player additions, including LeBron James, Anthony Davis and Luka Doncic.",
      "The Lakers won the 2020 championship in the Florida bubble, and they reached the 2024 Western Conference finals. Their seismic trade to acquire Doncic last winter rejuvenated the franchise, positioning the Slovenian superstar as the Lakers' centerpiece for years after the matchless career of James, who has essentially confirmed he will return in the fall for his record 23rd NBA season.",
      "Jeanie Buss hasn't yet announced her reasons for agreeing to sell her inheritance, and she will remain the Lakers' governor \u2014 at least for now, because a governor must own at least 15% of the team. But she is following a recent trend of high-profile NBA owners ceding their teams to ownership groups with even more extensive resources.",
      "Buss is close friends with both Mark Cuban, who sold his majority ownership of the Dallas Mavericks for $3.5 billion, and Wyc Grousbeck, who sold the Boston Celtics for $6.1 billion.",

      "Long Island\u2019s last commercial duck farm is rebuilding after a bird flu outbreak forced the destruction of its entire 100,000-bird flock in January",
      "AQUEBOGUE, N.Y. -- Doug Corwin knew there was a problem at his family\u2019s commercial duck farm in Long Island when he spotted scores of dead or lethargic birds during a barn inspection in January.",
      "Within days, Crescent Duck Farm became a casualty of the global avian flu outbreak, one of many farms around the U.S. that had to cull their entire flock, sending the prices of eggs and other agricultural commodities soaring.",
      "Now the more than century-old farm \u2014 the last duck farm remaining in a New York region once synonymous with the culinary delicacy \u2014 is cautiously rebuilding.",
      "But for Corwin, a 66-year-old fourth-generation farmer, it's not enough to bring the farm back to its 100,000-bird capacity.",
      "With ducks hatched from eggs spared from slaughter, he's working to preserve the unique lineage of fowl that's allowed his family's farm to thrive even as others on Long Island fell by the wayside \u2014 all while worrying that another flu outbreak would finally wipe him out.",
      "\u201cAll I know is I don\u2019t want to be hit again,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cIf I go through this twice, I\u2019m done as a duck farmer.\u201d",
      "For months, Corwin and his reduced staff have been thoroughly sanitizing the farm\u2019s dozens of barns, clearing out hay and debris, and replacing feeders, ventilation systems, wooden and metal structures and more.",
      "At the end of May, the first wave of roughly 900 young ducks arrived from a nearby farm where they had been carefully raised in quarantine these last few months.",
      "Another batch of 900 arrived last week and some 900 more will soon make their way to the roughly 140-acre (55-hectare) farm in Aquebogue, which is tucked among the vineyards and agricultural lands of Long Island\u2019s North Fork, about 80 miles (129 km) east of Manhattan.",
      "By the end of next summer, Corwin hopes the first ducks will be ready to be processed and brought to market.",
      "But he says he won't rush the reopening. It will be many more months \u2014 if ever \u2014 before the operation, which processed about 1 million ducks for consumption annually, returns to full capacity, he said.",
      "\u201cI keep telling people I\u2019m running a high hurdle race,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot a lot of steps to get back to where we were.\u201d",
      "Since 2022, the H5N1 strain of bird flu has been detected in all 50 states, leading to more than 1,700 recorded outbreaks affecting nearly 175 million birds, according to the most recent tally from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The outbreak at Corwin\u2019s farm shows how this strain has inflicted more damage on a wider range of species than past variants, said Dr. Gavin Hitchener, director of Cornell University\u2019s Duck Research Laboratory, located a short drive away in Eastport.",
      "Ducks have generally been less prone to serious illness and death than chickens and turkeys, he said. H5N1 is also vexing American cattle farmers after the virus jumped from fowl to cattle last year.",
      "\u201cSomething has changed in the virus\u2019 makeup that has made it more virulent,\u201d Hitchener said.",
      "With no end to the bird flu pandemic in sight, Corwin worries he won't be able to weather another outbreak.",
      "The farm received federal compensation for its euthanized ducks, but it wasn\u2019t nearly close to the market value of the birds \u2014 never mind the expense of rebuilding in a high cost region that also includes the Hamptons, he said.",
      "Corwin hopes the federal government will, at long last, require poultry operators to vaccinate their livestock against bird flu. It\u2019s an uphill climb, given the Trump administration\u2019s deep skepticism of vaccines and the long-standing opposition of far larger, industrial poultry operations, he acknowledged.",
      "\u201cI would sleep an awful lot better at night. But right now I\u2019m very nervous,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cWe\u2019re just playing with deck chairs on the Titanic.\u201d",
      "The ducks newly arrived to the farm are crucial to its revival.",
      "Fully grown and approaching breeding age, the cohort of white Pekin ducks were all that survived from the more than 15,000 eggs state officials allowed the farm to spare from the winter culling after they tested negative for bird flu.",
      "That means they and their progeny carry on the unique genetic makeup the farm has honed over generations of selective breeding to build its reputation.",
      "Established in 1908 by Corwin\u2019s great-grandfather, Crescent Duck Farms has been the island\u2019s lone commercial duck operation for the better part of a decade. But in the early 1960s, Long Island boasted more than 100 farms producing about two-thirds of the nation\u2019s duck output.",
      "\u201cI feel I owe it to the ancestors of farmers who\u2019ve been here all these years and have come this far to just make a go of it,\u201d Corwin said. \u201cI want to make Long Island proud.\u201d",

      "The original purchase of Holladay Bank was announced in 2023, but Bell said the transaction got delayed due to the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank that year.",
      "\u201cThis process has undoubtedly taken longer than any of us anticipated,\u201d Bell said. \u201cHowever, we are grateful for the diligence of the staff at the FDIC, the leadership of the (American Bankers Association), and the renewed sense of urgency from the new administration this year, all of which helped bring everything together.\u201d",

      "MDIs began in the 19th century when Black Americans, who could not get loans from mainstream banks, organized their banks and associations. They also provided financial services and economic opportunities in low-income neighborhoods.",

      "The Buss family has agreed to sell the controlling stake of the Los Angeles Lakers to TWG Global CEO Mark Walter, doing so with a franchise valuation of $10 billion \u2014 the highest ever for a professional sports franchise, a person with knowledge of the agreement said Wednesday.",
      "As part of the deal, Jeanie Buss \u2014 whose family has had control of the Lakers since her father bought the team in 1979 \u2014 intends to remain as team governor, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because neither side immediately announced details.",
      "It is not clear how much more of the Lakers that Walter is acquiring. He was part of a group that bought 27% of the Lakers in 2021. Jeanie Buss will still own at least 15% of the Lakers once this transaction is completed; by NBA rule, a governor must have at least that much of an ownership stake.",
      "Walter and TWG Global already had the controlling interest in the Los Angeles Dodgers, Premier League club Chelsea, the Professional Women\u2019s Hockey League, and \u2014 through TWG Motorsports \u2014 owns several auto racing teams including Cadillac Formula 1.",
      "Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said news of the sale to Walter marks \"a very exciting day for the Lakers, for the city of Los Angeles.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very competitive and he\u2019s going to do everything he can to produce a championship-caliber team every single year and make sure the city feels proud about the Lakers and the legacy that they\u2019ve already built with the Buss family,\" Roberts said.",
      "ESPN first reported the agreement.",
      "\u201cMark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand,\u201d Lakers legend Magic Johnson, a business partner of Walter's and someone extremely close to Jeanie Buss, posted on social media. \u201cThe proof is in the pudding on what he\u2019s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers. Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!\u201d",
      "Johnson said he is certain Jeanie Buss made the deal only after being convinced that Walter will do right by the Lakers.",
      "\u201cLaker fans should be (ecstatic),\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA few things I can tell you about Mark \u2014 he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike \u2014 they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world.\u201d",
      "Walter is intensely private in shunning the spotlight. He is CEO of the financial services firm Guggenheim Partners, which is estimated to have more than $325 billion in assets. Johnson is among Guggenheim\u2019s investors.",
      "The agreement for the sale of the Lakers comes about three months after Bill Chisholm agreed to buy the Boston Celtics with an initial valuation of $6.1 billion \u2014 which was going to be a record, topping the previous mark of $6.05 billion sale for the NFL's Washington Commanders. The Celtics' sale is not yet finalized, pending final approval by the NBA's board of governors. That board is scheduled to meet in Las Vegas next month.",
      "And now, the Lakers are sold with a valuation of $10 billion \u2014 not just a record, but a total smashing of the previous mark.",
      "The Lakers have been in the control of the Buss family for 46 years, the longest of any current NBA franchise. Herb Simon bought the Indiana Pacers \u2014 currently in the NBA Finals \u2014 in 1983, the second-longest current ownership of an NBA club.",
      "Jerry Buss bought the Lakers for $67.5 million and made it to the NBA Finals 16 times out of his 34 seasons leading the club, winning 10 championships in that span. When he died in 2013, ownership of the Lakers went into a trust controlled by Buss\u2019 six children \u2014 who all worked for the Lakers in various capacities for several years.",
      "Eventually, the family began clashing over control. An agreement was struck in 2017 calling for Jeanie Buss to serve as controlling owner, ending a battle that included her going to court after her brothers Jim and Johnny Buss called for a board meeting that she interpreted as a challenge to her power \u2014 shortly after she removed Jim Buss as the Lakers\u2019 executive vice president of basketball operations.",

      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle",
      "The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year, announcing its intent Wednesday to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle.",
      "Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said sterile male New World screwworm flies bred at the $8.5 million facility would be released into the wild to mate with females and prevent them from laying the eggs in wounds that become flesh-eating larva. It would be only the second facility for breeding such flies in the Western Hemisphere, joining one in Panama that had largely kept the flies from migrating further north until last year.",
      "The fly's appearance in southern Mexico late last year has worried agriculture and cattle industry officials and veterinarians' groups, and the U.S. last month suspended imports of live cattle, horses and bison from Mexico. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility for breeding fruit flies near Mexico's southernmost border with Guatemala into one for breeding sterile New World screwworm flies, but it won't be ready for 18 months.",
      "The U.S. bred and released sterile New World screwworm flies into the wild decades ago, and it was largely banished from the country in the 1960s. Previously, it had been an annual scourge for cattle ranchers and dairy farmers, particularly in the Southeast.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defeated NWS before, and we will do it again,\" Rollins said. She held a news conference at Moore Air Base with Texas and cattle industry officials.",
      "Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 said in a post Wednesday on X that Rollins\u2019 plan \u201cseems to us a positive step in different aspects, it will strengthen the joint Mexico-US work.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe trust the enthusiasm for cooperation that Secretary Rollins mentioned, and based on objective results and the reports from the USDA mission visiting us this week, we will be able to restart exports of our cattle as soon as possible,\" he said.",
      "The new Texas facility would be built at Moore Air Base, less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Mexico border, and the USDA said it would also consider building a companion fly-breeding center there so that up to 300 million flies could be produced a week. The Panama facility breeds about 100 million a week, and the one in Mexico could breed as many as 100 million as well.",
      "The USDA has said the flies have been detected as close as 700 miles (1,127 kilometers) from the U.S. border, and some U.S. agriculture and cattle industry officials have worried that if the migration isn't checked, the flies could reach the border by the end of summer. Pressure from the U.S. prompted Mexico to step up efforts to control the fly's spread.",
      "Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattle rancher and the president of the National Beef Cattlemen's Association, said Moore Air Base had a fly-breeding facility in the 1960s that helped eradicate it in the U.S.",
      "While there are treatments for New World screwworm infestations, cattle industry officials still worry that farmers and ranchers could see huge economic losses. They, agriculture officials and scientists also said the larva can infest any mammal, including household pets, and it has occasionally been seen in humans.",
      "\u201cThe only way to protect the American cattle herd from the devastating threat of New World screwworm is by having a sufficient supply of sterile flies to push this pest away from our border,\u201d Wehrbein said.",
      "Texas officials said they are grateful that the U.S. is taking the screwworm threat serious and pleased with the plans for combating it, including the new facility in Texas.",
      "Officials in other states are watching the fly's migration as well and see having sterile male flies outnumber the non-sterile one is crucial to checking its migration.",
      "\u201cWe have a real concern about wildlife because of their ability to cross the border unchecked somewhat, whether it's feral pigs, deer, wild cattle, whatever the case may be,\u201d Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said in a recent interview. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity for them to be our exposure risk.\u201d",

      "More and more celebrities are looking to attach their names to your phone",
      "NEW YORK -- More and more celebrities are looking to attach their names to your phone. Or rather, wireless services that could power it.",
      "From cosmetics to snacks and signature spirits, brands launched or co-owned by high-profile figures are just about everywhere you look today. But several big names are also venturing into the market for mobile virtual network operators \u2014 or MVNOs, an industry term for businesses that provide cell coverage by leasing infrastructure from bigger, more established carriers.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump's family was the most recent to join the list with the launch of Trump Mobile this week. Here's what to know.",
      "On Monday, The Trump Organization (currently run by the president's sons Eric and Donald Jr.) unveiled Trump Mobile. The company says this new business will offer cell service, through an apparent licensing deal with \u201call three major cellular carriers\" in the U.S., and sell gold phones by August.",
      "Trump Mobile marks the latest in a string of new Trump-branded offerings \u2014 which already span from golden sneakers to \u201cGod Bless the USA\u201d bibles \u2014 despite mounting ethical concerns that the president is profiting off his position and could distort public policy for personal gain.",
      "\"This raises a real question about a conflict of interest,\u201d said Ben Bentzin, an associate professor of instruction at The University of Texas at Austin\u2019s McCombs School of Business. As the sitting president, Trump appoints leadership for the Federal Communications Commission \u2014 and the family's new phone venture exists under this regulatory authority.",
      "All of this sets Trump Mobile apart from other big names that have recently ventured into the wireless business. Still, its launch arrives as a growing number of celebrities tap into this space.",
      "Just last week, actors Jason Bateman, Sean Hayes and Will Arnett launched SmartLess Mobile, a name that mirrors the trio's \u201cSmartLess\u201d podcast. Now live across the contiguous U.S. and Puerto Rico, SmartLess Mobile runs on T-Mobile's 5G Network.",
      "Another wireless provider with ties to fame is Mint Mobile. While not launched by celebrities, Ryan Reynolds purchased an ownership stake in Mint in 2019. Mint's parent, the Ka\u2019ena Corporation, was later acquired by T-Mobile in a deal worth up to $1.35 billion.",
      "Beyond names of famous people, well-known brands that weren't traditionally in the phone business have also got in on the action over the years \u2014 particuarly outside of the U.S., Forrester Research senior analyst Octavio Garcia Granados notes. He points to Walmart's \u201cBait\u201d mobile plan in Mexico, for example, as well as Italian soccer club AC Milan launching its own mobile SIM cards for fans.",
      "\u201cThe MVNO market is not new,\" said Garcia Granados. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is the development on how it\u2019s consumed and the (ease) for brands to launch such plans.\u201d",
      "MVNOs have also emerged outside of high-profile brands or launch teams. Bentzin points to Straight Talk and Cricket \u2014 which are now owned by Verizon and AT&T, respectively. Still, traditional celebrity endorsements are common across the board. And in recent years, \u201cinfluencer marketing\" has been \u201cthe fastest growing area of advertising and promotion,\" he notes.",
      "For Trump Mobile, the pitch seems to be all about having an \u201call-American service\" while also tapping into the fan base of the president.",
      "The company noted Monday that it chose to unveil Trump Mobile on the 10th anniversary of Trump launching \"his historic presidential campaign.\u201d The name given to its flagship offer, The 47 Plan, and the $47.45 monthly fee make reference to the president's two terms. And a mock-up of the planned gold phone on the company\u2019s website shows Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great\u201d slogan on the front screen.",
      "According to the company, Trump Mobile's 47 Plan will include unlimited calls, texts and data through partner carriers, as well as free roadside assistance and telehealth services. It also says the new phone, called the \u201cT1 Phone,\u201d will be available for $499 in August \u2014 but notes that this device won\u2019t be designed or made by Trump Mobile. Still, the company emphasized that these phones will be built in the U.S.",
      "Experts have since shared skepticism about that being possible in two months. And beyond the future T1 Phone, others stress that a monthly cell service fee of just under $50 is pricey compared to other MVNO options today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not actual lower pricing. It\u2019s really trading on the fan base, if you will, of Trump,\u201d said Bentzin.",
      "SmartLess Mobile and Mint Mobile, of course, don't carry these same political ties. And the wireless plans offered by both boast less expensive offerings.",
      "T-Mobile-owned Mint advertises \u201cflexible, buy-in-bulk\u201d plans that range from $15 to $30 a month. Each option includes unlimited talk and text nationwide, but vary depending on plan length and data amount. Mint, founded in 2016, says it started \u201cbecause we\u2019d had enough of the wireless industry\u2019s games\u201d \u2014 and promises to help consumers avoid hidden fees.",
      "SmartLess Mobile's plans also start at $15 a month. Depending on the data amount purchased, that base fee can rise to $30 \u2014 but all of its plans similarly offer unlimited talk and text using T-Mobile's network. When launching last week, SmartLess underlined that its goal is to help people stop paying for the data they don't use, noting that the majority of data used by consumers today happens over Wi-Fi.",
      "\u201cSeriously, if your phone bill knew how often you\u2019re on Wi-Fi, it would be embarrassed,\" Hayes said in a statement for SmartLess Mobile's June 10 launch.",
      "MVNOs have proven to be attractive acquisitions to big wireless carriers over the years. But whether or not the star factor promises significant demand has yet to be seen for the market's most recent entrants.",
      "For the more established Mint Mobile, Reynolds' investment is a success story. The 25% stake that the actor reportedly owned in 2023, when the company announced that it would be acquired by T-Mobile, was estimated to give him a personal windfall of over $300 million in cash and stock. And since that deal closed, Reynolds has remained in his creative role for Mint and as the face of many campaigns \u2014 helping the brand continue to attract new customers.",
      "It's no surprise that the potential of such business returns might attract other celebrities to make similar investments, Bentzin notes. Still, newer ventures are untested. And \"as the market becomes more crowded, it could be harder and harder to pick off individual consumers,\u201d he added.",
      "Beyond a high-profile name, quality of service and what consumers can afford is also critical.",
      "\u201cThe competition battleground here is brand and price,\u201d Bentzin said.",
      "Still, if the marketing is right and product meets consumer needs, experts like Garcia Granados note that MVNOs can be a profitable business, for both the brands that start them and the telecommunications giants \u2014 like T-Mobile, Verizon and AT&T \u2014 offering this \u201cwholesale\u201d access to their infrastructure.",
      "As a result, he said, such high-profile ventures become \u201ca catalyst for others to follow.\"",

      "Safety experts recommend that the engines on Boeing\u2019s troubled 737 Max airplanes be modified quickly to prevent smoke from filling the cockpit or cabin after a safety feature is activated following a bird strike",
      "Safety experts recommended Wednesday that the engines on Boeing's troubled 737 Max airplanes be modified quickly to prevent smoke from filling the cockpit or cabin after a safety feature is activated following a bird strike.",
      "The problem detailed by the National Transportation Safety Board emerged after two bird strikes involving Southwest Airlines planes in 2023 \u2014 one in Havana, Cuba, and another in New Orleans. The Federal Aviation Administration and Boeing already warned airlines and pilots about the problem and the engine maker has been working on a fix.",
      "The NTSB said that the engines CFM International makes for the Boeing plane can inadvertently release oil into the hot engine when the safety feature, called a load reduction device, is activated after a bird strike or similar engine issue. The resulting smoke feeds directly into either the cockpit or passenger cabin depending on which engine was struck.",
      "Similar engine models with the same safety feature are also used on Airbus A320neo planes and C919 planes made by the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China. The NTSB urged European and Chinese aviation safety regulators to evaluate those engine models to determine if they could also be susceptible to the smoke problem.",
      "The new safety device that CFM added to its engines solved one problem by limiting damage when an engine starts to come apart, but created a new problem by releasing the oil that burns and generates smoke.",
      "\u201cThis is a case of an unintended consequence of a new and innovative safety idea where if the fan gets unbalanced that this is a way to alleviate the load and thereby doing less damage to the engine, the engine pylon, all of that,\u201d said aviation safety expert John Cox, who is CEO of the Safety Operating Systems consulting firm.",
      "CFM said in a statement that it is \u201caligned with the NTSB\u2019s recommendations and the work is already underway, in close partnership with our airframers, to enhance the capability of this important system.\u201d The company, which is a joint venture between GE Aerospace and Safran Aircraft Engines, confirmed it is working on a software update for the 737 Max\u2019s engines and said it is evaluating similar engine models.",
      "Boeing said it is working with CFM on the update and the planemaker supports NTSB's recommendations. Boeing also updated some of the checklists pilots rely on to help them take appropriate actions.",
      "The NTSB investigated a December 2023 incident in which a Southwest Airlines plane struck a bird while taking off from New Orleans and had to land quickly after thick smoke filled the cockpit \u2014 even making it hard for the pilot to see the instrument panel or his copilot.",
      "In an incident nine months earlier involving another Southwest 737 Max, smoke filled the cabin after a bird strike after takeoff in Havana.",
      "Air from the left engine on a 737 Max flows directly into the cockpit while air from the right engine flows into the passenger cabin.",
      "While these incidents were both bird strikes, the NTSB said this could happen in certain other circumstances.",
      "The FAA said in a statement that it agrees with the NTSB recommendations and when \u201cthe engine manufacturer develops a permanent mitigation, we will require operators to implement it within an appropriate timeframe.\u201d",
      "Pilots can act to limit smoke in the plane by manually cutting off airflow from the engines, but smoke can quickly start to fill the cabin within a few seconds. The engine manufacturer is working on a software update that should do that automatically, but that\u2019s not expected to be ready until sometime in the first quarter of next year.",
      "The NTSB said in its report that several pilots who fly Boeing 737s told investigators they weren't aware of these incidents despite the efforts Boeing and the FAA have made. The NTSB said \u201cit is critical to ensure that pilots who fly airplanes equipped with CFM LEAP-1B engines are fully aware of the potential for smoke in the cockpit.\u201d",
      "Airbus didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "A Southwest spokesperson said the airline has been in close contact with the FAA, Boeing and the engine maker since the incidents and notified its pilots after they happened. The spokesperson said the airline continues to address the issue through its training and safety management systems.",
      "The Boeing 737 Max planes have been the focus since they were involved in both incidents, and there has been a history of other problems with that plane.",
      "The Max version of Boeing\u2019s bestselling 737 airplane has been the source of persistent troubles for Boeing after two of the jets crashed. The crashes, one in Indonesia in 2018 and another in Ethiopia in 2019, killed 346 people.",
      "The problem in those crashes stemmed from a sensor providing faulty readings that pushed the nose down, leaving pilots unable to regain control. After the second crash, Max jets were grounded worldwide until the company redesigned the system.",
      "Last month, the Justice Department reached a deal to allow Boeing to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the Max before the two crashes.",
      "Worries about the plane flared up again after a door plug blew off a Max operated by Alaska Airlines, leading regulators to cap Boeing\u2019s production at 38 jets per month. The NTSB plans to meet next Tuesday to discuss what investigators found about that incident.",

      "In reopening the visa process, the State Department also told consulates to prioritize students hoping to enroll at colleges where foreigners make up less than 15% of the student body, a U.S. official familiar with the matter said. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to detail information that has not been made public.",
      "Foreign students make up more than 15% of the total student body at almost 200 U.S. universities, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal education data from 2023. Most are private universities, including all eight Ivy League schools. But that criteria also includes 26 public universities, including the University of Illinois and Pennsylvania State University. Looking only at undergraduate students, foreign students make up more than 15% of the population at about 100 universities, almost all of them private.",
      "International students in the U.S. have been facing increased scrutiny on several fronts. In the spring, the Trump administration revoked permission to study in the U.S. for thousands of students, including some involved only in traffic offenses, before abruptly reversing course. The government also expanded the grounds on which foreign students can have their legal status terminated.",
      "As part of a pressure campaign targeting Harvard University, the Trump administration has moved to block foreign students from attending the Ivy League school, which counts on international students for tuition dollars and a quarter of its enrollment. Trump has said Harvard should cap its foreign enrollment at 15%.",
      "This latest move to vet students' social media, the State Department said Wednesday, \"will ensure we are properly screening every single person attempting to visit our country.\u201d",
      "In internal guidance sent to consular officers, the department said they should be looking for \u201cany indications of hostility toward the citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles of the United States.\u201d",
      "Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said the new policy evokes the ideological vetting of the Cold War, when prominent artists and intellectuals were excluded from the U.S.",
      "\u201cThis policy makes a censor of every consular officer, and it will inevitably chill legitimate political speech both inside and outside the United States,\" Jaffer said.",
      "The Trump administration also has called for 36 countries to commit to improving vetting of travelers or face a ban on their citizens visiting the United States. A weekend diplomatic cable sent by the State Department says the countries have 60 days to address U.S. concerns or risk being added to a travel ban that now includes 12 nations.",

      "NEW YORK -- Honda is recalling more than 259,000 of its cars across the U.S. due to a problem that can cause the brake pedal to shift out of position, potentially interfering with a driver's ability to stop or slow down.",
      "According to documents published by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the recall covers certain Honda Pilots between model years 2023 and 2025 \u2014 as well cars under the auto maker's luxury Acura brand: 2021-2025 Acura TLX and 2023-2025 Acura MDX vehicles.",
      "The NHTSA's recall report notes that the brake pedal pivot pin in some of these vehicles was not secured properly during production. That can lead the pedal to shift out of place and \u201cmay lead to unintended application,\u201d the report notes, increasing crash risks.",
      "\u201cThe issue could also cause an abnormal brake pedal feeling during operation, illuminate the brake malfunction light in the instrument cluster, or cause the vehicle\u2019s brake lights to remain lit even when the brake pedal is not applied,\u201d America Honda said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "As a remedy, Honda says authorized dealers will inspect the vehicles covered by this recall and replace the brake pedal assembly if necessary, free of charge. Per the NHTSA's report, the company estimates 1% of these vehicles have this issue.",
      "Dealer notifications began on June 13. And mailed owner notification letters are set to follow on July 28. In the meantime, drivers can also confirm if their specific vehicle is included in this recall and find more information using the NHTSA site or Honda's recall lookup.",
      "Between February 2024 and June 5, the NHSTA notes, Honda received three warranty claims related to this issue \u2014 but no reports of injuries.",
      "Honda began investigating the faulty brake pedal in April 2024, after receiving a report of a vehicle experiencing this issue. The company later determined that improper assembly of the brake pedal pivot pin occurred at a supplier's U.S. plant, which has since been closed. Production was transferred to a plant in Mexico \u2014 where the supplier now uses a camera sensor \u201cto verify whether the pivot pin is staked,\" the recall report notes.",

      "Led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C. are suing in federal court to challenge President Donald Trump\u2019s Day One executive order halting leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.",
      "Judge William G. Young said during a hearing that he plans to allow the case to proceed against Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, but will dismiss the action against Trump and cabinet secretaries other than Burgum named as defendants.",
      "He said he thinks states do have standing to sue, which the federal government had argued against. The states can proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution, Young said.",
      "Young said his rulings from the bench were tentative and reserved the right to alter them in writing his formal opinion.",
      "The coalition of attorneys general sued to ask that a judge declare the executive order unlawful and approve an injunction to stop federal agencies from implementing it. They argued that Trump doesn't have the authority to halt project permitting and doing so jeopardizes the states' economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.",
      "The government is arguing that the states' claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the bounds of the federal court's jurisdiction. Department of Justice Attorney Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn't halt it, while the Interior secretary reviews the environmental impact and that this effort is underway. He said states have not shown that they were harmed by a specific permit not being issued.",
      "Turner Smith, from the Massachusetts attorney general's office, countered that the government has provided no end date and that Trump's order imposes a \u201ccategorical and indefinite halt.\" She said states have been harmed and pointed to a offshore wind project for Massachusetts, now pushed back by two years because its three outstanding permits are delayed due to the wind order. She said Massachusetts can't meet its targets for procuring offshore wind energy without the SouthCoast wind project.",
      "Wind is the U.S.' largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.",
      "Trump prioritizes fossil fuels and said last week that his administration would not approve wind energy projects except in cases of emergency. The administration had ordered a Norwegian company, Equinor, to halt construction on a fully permitted offshore wind project in New York, though Equinor has been allowed to resume work.",
      "The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C.",

      "MCCLEAN, Va. -- The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage eased for the third week in a row, a welcome trend for prospective homebuyers at a time when elevated borrowing costs remain a drag on the housing market.",
      "The long-term rate fell to 6.81% from 6.84% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. A year ago, the rate averaged 6.87%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, also fell. The average rate eased to 5.96% from 5.97% last week. A year ago, it was 6.13%, according to Freddie Mac.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors\u2019 expectations for the economy and inflation. The key barometer is the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year Treasury yield was at 4.35% at midday Wednesday, down from 4.58% just a few weeks ago.",
      "The average rate on a 30-year mortgage has remained relatively close to its high so far this year of just above 7%, set in mid-January. The 30-year rate\u2019s low point this year was in early April when it briefly dipped to 6.62%.",
      "With the latest decline, the average rate is now back to where it was in mid-May, reflecting a recent pullback in bond yields.",
      "High mortgage rates can add hundreds of dollars a month in costs for borrowers and reduce their purchasing power. That\u2019s helped keep the U.S. housing market in a sales slump that dates back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from the rock-bottom lows they reached during the pandemic.",
      "Last year, sales of previously occupied U.S. homes sank to their lowest level in nearly 30 years. Sales remain weak this year, most recently dampening the spring homebuying season.",

      "More employers are putting health insurance decisions in the hands of workers",
      "A small, growing number of employers are putting health insurance decisions entirely in the hands of their workers.",
      "Instead of offering traditional insurance, they\u2019re giving workers money to buy their own coverage in what\u2019s known as Individual Coverage Health Reimbursement Arrangements, or ICHRAs.",
      "Advocates say this approach provides small companies that couldn\u2019t afford insurance a chance to offer something. It also caps a growing expense for employers and fits conservative political goals of giving people more purchasing power over their coverage.",
      "But ICHRAs place the risk for finding coverage on the employee, and they force them to do something many dislike: Shop for insurance.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s maybe not perfect, but it\u2019s solving a problem for a lot of people,\u201d said Cynthia Cox, of the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care issues.",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at how this approach to health insurance is evolving.",
      "Normally, U.S. employers offering health coverage will have one or two insurance options for workers through what\u2019s known as a group plan. The employers then pick up most of the premium, or cost of coverage.",
      "ICHRAs are different: Employers contribute to health insurance coverage, but the workers then pick their own insurance plans. The employers that use ICHRAs hire outside firms to help people make their coverage decisions.",
      "ICHRAs were created during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration. Enrollment started slowly but has swelled in recent years.",
      "They give business owners a predictable cost, and they save companies from having to make coverage decisions for employees.",
      "\u201cYou have so many things you need to focus on as a business owner to just actually grow the business,\u201d said Jeff Yuan, co-founder of the New York-based insurance startup Taro Health.",
      "Small businesses, in particular, can be vulnerable to annual insurance cost spikes, especially if some employees have expensive medical conditions. But the ICHRA approach keeps the employer cost more predictable.",
      "Yuan's company bases its contributions on the employee's age and how many people are covered under the plan. That means it may contribute anywhere from $400 to more than $2,000 monthly to an employee's coverage.",
      "ICHRAs let people pick from among dozens of options in an individual insurance market instead of just taking whatever their company offers.",
      "That may give people a chance to find coverage more tailored to their needs. Some insurers, for instance, offer plans designed for people with diabetes.",
      "And workers can keep the coverage if they leave \u2014 potentially for longer periods than they would be able to with traditional employer health insurance plans. They likely will have to pay the full premium, but keeping the coverage also means they won\u2019t have to find a new plan that covers their doctors.",
      "Mark Bertolini, CEO of the insurer Oscar Health, noted that most people change jobs several times.",
      "\u201cInsurance works best when it moves with the consumer,\u201d said the executive, whose company is growing enrollment through ICHRAs in several states.",
      "Health insurance plans on the individual market tend to have narrower coverage networks than employer-sponsored coverage.",
      "It may be challenging for patients who see several doctors to find one plan that covers them all.",
      "People shopping for their own insurance can find coverage choices and terms like deductibles or coinsurance overwhelming. That makes it important for employers to provide help with plan selection.",
      "The broker or technology platform setting up a company\u2019s ICHRA generally does this by asking about their medical needs or if they have any surgeries planned in the coming year.",
      "There are no good numbers nationally that show how many people have coverage through an ICHRA or a separate program for companies with 50 workers or less.",
      "However, the HRA Council, a trade association that promotes the arrangements, sees big growth. The council works with companies that help employers offer the ICHRAs. It studies growth in a sample of those businesses.",
      "It says about 450,000 people were offered coverage through these arrangements this year. That\u2019s up 50% from 2024. Council Executive Director Robin Paoli says the total market may be twice as large.",
      "Still, these arrangements make up a sliver of employer-sponsored health coverage in the United States. About 154 million people were enrolled in coverage through work last year, according to KFF.",
      "Several things could cause more employers to offer ICHRAs. As health care costs continue to climb, more companies may look to limit their exposure to the hit.",
      "Some tax breaks and incentives that encourage the arrangements could wind up in a final version of the Republican tax bill currently under consideration in the Senate.",
      "More people also will be eligible for the arrangements if extra government subsidies that help buy coverage on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual marketplaces expire this year.",
      "You can\u2019t participate in an ICHRA if you are already getting a subsidy from the government, noted Brian Blase, a White House health policy adviser in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cThe enhanced subsidies, they crowd out private financing,\u201d he said.",

      "Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores suffer now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores drop now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection. But there are things you can do to help your score rebound.",
      "Courtney Alev, consumer advocate at Credit Karma, said it's understandable that people have missed payments because of the mixed messages around student loans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really at a moment of enormous empathy for the consumer,\u201d she said. \u201cBut now it's critical to make a plan.\"",
      "The U.S. Department of Education paused federal student loan payments in March 2020, offering borrowers relief during the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Though payments technically resumed in 2023, the Biden administration provided a one-year grace period that ended in October 2024. Last month, the Trump administration restarted the collection process for outstanding student loans, with plans to seize wages and tax refunds if the loans continue to go unpaid.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, about 1 in 4 people with federal student loans were more than 90 days behind on payments at the end of March.",
      "Here's what you should keep in mind:",
      "A credit score is a formula that helps lenders determine how likely you are to pay back a loan. Credit scores are based on your history of payments and your credit utilization and range from 300 to 850.",
      "Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, the three main credit bureaus, each have their own model to calculate credit scores.",
      "Factors frequently used to calculate your credit score are:",
      "\u2014 Bill payment history",
      "\u2014 Length of credit history",
      "\u2014 Current unpaid debt",
      "\u2014 How much of your available credit you\u2019re using (also known as credit utilization)",
      "\u2014 New credit requests",
      "\u2014 If you have had debt sent to collection, foreclosure, or a bankruptcy",
      "Each of the three credit bureaus allow you to check your credit score for free at least once a year, and many banks offer this service as well.",
      "Other companies such as NerdWallet, Credit Karma and WalletHub also offer the service.",
      "A score of 670 or higher is considered \u201cgood.\u201d If your credit score is over 750, that's considered \u201cgreat.\u201d",
      "\u201cFair\u201d credit scores are in the 580-669 range, and a score below 580 is considered \u201cpoor.\u201d",
      "In the first three months of 2025, 2.2 million student loan recipients saw their scores drop by 100 points, and an additional 1 million had drops of 150 points or more, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The study's authors attribute those changes to loans falling into delinquency, or 90 days or more of nonpayment, which is then reported to credit bureaus.",
      "To avoid those consequences, or to improve your score, the simplest steps include paying at least the monthly minimum payment and setting up auto-pay to make sure payments are never late.",
      "Alev says that it's worthwhile to get into the habit of regularly checking your score, so that you're never surprised by any changes, and you can dispute any errors or negative dips.",
      "\u201cIt's important to monitor for mistakes you need to dispute,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you've only missed one payment, or it's your first time missing a payment, you can often call and ask for forgiveness because of a history of solid payments.\u201d",
      "Many borrowers reported that they never received notice from the Department of Education that their student loan payments were resuming, even though they were meant to have been notified at least three weeks in advance. Monitoring your credit score regularly means you can catch any changes before it\u2019s too late to correct significant hits.",
      "Maintaining a steady, low credit usage, known as credit utilization, is another straightforward way to improve your score, Alev said.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a confusing term, but credit usage is key,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially what percentage of your available credit you\u2019re currently using. If you have a $10,000 credit limit each month, and you use $2,000, that\u2019s a 20% credit utilization. An easy rules of thumb to remember is to keep your utilization below 30%.

      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel say they've finalized their \u201chistoric partnership,\u201d a year-and-a-half after the Japanese company first proposed its deal to buy the iconic American steelmaker for nearly $15 billion",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel said Wednesday they have finalized their \u201chistoric partnership,\u201d a year-and-a-half after the Japanese company first proposed its deal to buy the iconic American steelmaker for nearly $15 billion.",
      "The pursuit by Nippon Steel for the Pittsburgh company was buffeted by national security concerns and presidential politics in a premier battleground state, delaying the transaction for more than a year after U.S. Steel shareholders approved it. It also forced Nippon Steel to expand the deal, including adding a so-called \u201cgolden share\u201d provision that gives the federal government a say in some matters.",
      "\u201cTogether, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel will be a world-leading steelmaker, with best-in-class technologies and manufacturing capabilities,\u201d the companies said.",
      "The combined company will become the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, and bring what analysts say is Nippon Steel's top-notch technology to U.S. Steel's antiquated steelmaking processes. In exchange, Nippon Steel gets access to a robust U.S. steel market, strengthened in recent years by tariffs under President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden, analysts say.",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel did not list the full terms of the deal, and did not release a national security agreement struck with Trump's administration.",
      "But in a statement Wednesday, the companies said the federal government will have the right to appoint an independent director and \u201cconsent rights\u201d on specific matters. Those include reductions in Nippon Steel's capital commitments in the national security agreement, closing or idling of U.S. Steel\u2019s existing domestic facilities and changing U. S. Steel\u2019s name and headquarters.",
      "Nippon Steel announced in December 2023 that it planned to buy the steel producer for $14.9 billion in cash and debt, and committed to keep the U.S. Steel name and Pittsburgh headquarters.",
      "The United Steelworkers union, which represents some U.S. Steel employees, opposed the deal, and Biden and Trump both vowed from the campaign trail to block it.",
      "Biden used his authority to block Nippon Steel\u2019s acquisition of U.S. Steel on his way out of the White House after a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.",
      "After he was elected, Trump changed course and expressed openness to working out an arrangement and ordered another review by the committee. That\u2019s when the idea of the \u201cgolden share\u201d emerged as a way to resolve national security concerns and protect American interests in domestic steel production.",
      "As it sought to win over American officials, Nippon Steel also made a series of bigger capital commitments in U.S. Steel facilities, tallying $11 billion through 2028, it said.",

    "summary": "On a former military base in Galena, Alaska, a school that houses about 200 high school students teaches sustainability among many things",
    "story": [
      "On a former military base in Galena, Alaska, a school that houses about 200 high school students teaches sustainability among many things",
      "GALENA, Alaska -- Eric Huntington built his dream cabin nestled in the wilderness of central Alaska, eventually raising two daughters there. But over the years, he learned that living in this quiet, remote village came with a hefty cost.",
      "Every year, the Huntington family spent about $7,000 on diesel to heat the cabin during bone-chilling winters, and a few years back, a power outage at the town's diesel plant left residents freezing in minus 50 F (about minus 45 C). When power finally returned hours later, water pipes had frozen, leaving about two dozen homes without running water for days.",
      "\"We just didn\u2019t open our door all morning until the lights came back on,\u201d said Huntington, a member of the local Louden Tribe.",
      "In Galena, a sprawling village of 400 people on the banks of the Yukon River, a community built around a former military base is shifting to clean energy in an effort to reduce its reliance on expensive, imported diesel. Local leaders say their nearly completed solar farm, along with an existing biomass plant, will boost the town's savings and protect residents from blackouts during extreme weather. The technology has the potential to provide clean backup power in emergencies and improve the power grid's resiliency, all while diversifying the village's energy sources and providing job opportunities for locals.",
      "The projects come at a precarious time for renewable energy transition in the United States. The Trump administration has canceled billions of dollars of clean energy grants in an effort to bolster fossil fuel production, and billions more in investments have been scrapped or delayed this year. So far, the village's federal grants for the solar array haven't been impacted, but local leaders know the risk remains. Whatever the future of public funding, the village is an example of how renewable energies can save costs, boost reliability during extreme weather and create jobs.",
      "Once online, the solar array will ensure that the village\u2019s power grid has a backup system, said Tim Kalke, general manager of Sustainable Energy for Galena Alaska \u2014 or SEGA \u2014 a nonprofit that will operate it. So when the power goes out, it doesn\u2019t result in tens of thousands of dollars in repairs, he added, and heat is guaranteed in times of extreme cold.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with life, health and safety,\u201d he said.",
      "In May, dozens of high school students in navy blue caps and gowns stood with nervous excitement in a locker-brimmed hallway, each waiting their turn to walk through yellow tinsel into a packed auditorium. It was graduation day for Galena Interior Learning Academy.",
      "The school's vocational training courses and cultural offerings attract some 200 students annually from across Alaska, boosting the village's population and energy needs.",
      "Students here can take classes on sustainable energy, aviation, carpentry and much more. But in order to keep it running \u2014 especially during long, cold winters \u2014 it needs heat.",
      "That's where the biomass project comes in. Every winter since 2016, trees (mostly paper birch) are locally harvested and shredded into wood chips that fuel a large boiler plant on campus, offsetting about 100,000 gallons (about 380,000 liters) of diesel annually for the school district and the city, said Brad Scotton, a Galena City Council member who also serves on SEGA's board. It's notable as one of the state's first large-scale biomass plants and is the most rural, he added.",
      "Cost savings from using biomass has allowed the Galena City School District to hire certified professionals in trade jobs and do upkeep on campus facilities, said district superintendent Jason R. Johnson in an email.",
      "It's also created a local workforce and a job base the village never used to have. \u201cIt's keeping the money that used to go outside within the community and providing pretty meaningful jobs for people,\" Scotton said.",
      "In rural areas of Alaska, the costs for many goods can be high, as they must be brought in. Galena burns just under 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of diesel annually to produce electricity, and an energy price hike around 2008 helped the village realize something needed to change. Scotton remembered when a gallon of diesel was $1.64 and then skyrocketed to $4.58 another year. At that wholesale price, the city was paying more than $1.8 million to keep the lights on.",
      "\u201cIt was really quite a shock to everybody\u2019s system in terms of trying to operate with those elevated costs,\u201d said Scotton. \u201cSo that really got the community assessing whether or not we could continue business as usual with that reliance.\u201d That's when they started looking for grants to build a solar array.",
      "On an overcast May day, on a field flanked by boreal forests, workers in reflective safety vests slotted rectangular panels on a metal grid. They were working on the nearly-completed, 1.5 megawatt solar farm that will connect to a battery system.",
      "Once in use, the community will be able to turn off its diesel engines and run on 100% clean, renewable energy on sunny summer days, and any excess power will be battery stored for nights, emergencies or heating the local indoor pool. The solar array will allow them to shut off the diesel operation between 800 to 1,000 hours a year, totaling about 100,000 gallons (about 380,000 liters).",
      "The solar farm won\u2019t necessarily lower people\u2019s electricity bills. But like the biomass plant, the hope is that it will stabilize energy costs, allowing those savings to go back into the community, all while providing work opportunities for residents like Aaren Sommer.",
      "Last year, the 19-year old graduated from the academy, where he learned about solar energy. Now he's helping to install the solar array. \u201cThat\u2019s going to reduce the diesel usage a whole bunch over at the power plant, which is going to help us out,\u201d he said.",
      "In addition to the solar farm and biomass project, the Louden Tribe is building new energy-efficient homes that will help members be less reliant on diesel. Some of the siding used in the homes comes from wood harvested in the area.",
      "In November, the Huntington family moved into a new, stilted house with a solar-compatible roof, 13-inch (33-centimeter) walls and 18 inches (46 centimeters) of insulation to keep the cold at bay. When they lived in the cabin, the $7,000 a year Huntington spent on diesel was a good chunk of his annual income.",
      "The new home's energy-efficient features are already saving them money. The 300-gallon (1,130-liter) diesel tank Huntington filled before moving cost him about $2,400. Six months later, he still has unused fuel in the tank.",
      "The Huntingtons are one of eight families the tribe has moved into sustainable homes, and they plan to turn over the keys to three more this year.",
      "Kalke, SEGA's general manager, is often asked what Galena produces. He used to just say education.",
      "\"But since 2016 you can say education and wood chips. And soon, solar energy,\u201d he said.",

      "The bowl of the famous trophy is cracked and the bottom is dented. Not for the first time and likely not the last.",
      "The Panthers won their second consecutive championship on home ice Tuesday night, beating Edmonton in six games. The team, following decades of tradition, partied with the Cup into the wee hours and kept the revelry going in Fort Lauderdale well into Wednesday afternoon.",
      "A spokesperson for the Hockey Hall of Fame said the keepers of the Cup are taking the appropriate steps and plan to have it repaired by the celebration parade on Sunday. Made of silver and a nickel alloy, the 37-pound Cup is relatively malleable.",
      "Damage is nothing new for the 131-year-old silver chalice that has been submerged in pools and the Atlantic Ocean and mishandled by players, coaches and staff for more than a century. Just this decade alone, the Tampa Bay Lightning dropped the Cup during their boat parade in 2021 and the Colorado Avalanche dented it on the ice the night they won the following year.",

      "Difficult as it may seem, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is desperately trying to not think about what may await the Oklahoma City Thunder",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Difficult as it may seem, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is desperately trying to not think about what may await the Oklahoma City Thunder.",
      "The MVP, scoring champion and Thunder star doesn't want to think about the end of the NBA Finals. Or how the Larry O'Brien Trophy will feel in his hands if he gets to finally hoist it as a champion. Or what the celebration will look like, sound like, be like.",
      "The Thunder are one win from a title, and it could come when they visit the potentially shorthanded Indiana Pacers in Game 6 of the NBA Finals on Thursday night. It is not just another game. Gilgeous-Alexander is trying to make it seem that way.",
      "\u201cThe cusp of winning is not winning,\u201d Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cThe way I see it, winning is all that matters. It hasn\u2019t been fulfilled. We haven\u2019t done anything.\u201d",
      "Technically, that's true. In actuality, that's also slightly ridiculous.",
      "They lead the NBA Finals 3-2, have posted 83 wins so far this season and just found a way to hand Indiana its first set of back-to-back losses in three months. The Thunder, just as they did against Denver in Round 2, have bounced back from series deficits of 1-0 and 2-1, and are closer to a title than the franchise \u2014 at least since moving to Oklahoma City \u2014 has ever been.",
      "\u201cWe want to win the game tomorrow, but the most important thing we need to do to win the game tomorrow is prepare today and prepare tomorrow and play the first possession really well, then the next possession, then the next possession,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s how we try to approach a game, how we try to approach the playoff series, how we try to approach every single day and let that win the day.\u201d",
      "The Pacers expect a crazed atmosphere for what will be their final home game of the season; if they force a Game 7 it'll be in Oklahoma City on Sunday. What the Pacers don't know is if Tyrese Haliburton will be able to play; he's dealing with a strained right calf and his status won't be definitively known until Thursday.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s all we can do, right? Think about the next game,\u201d Pacers forward Pascal Siakam said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity in front of our fans. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to be a huge moment for our fans. They\u2019re going to be super excited. We have a chance at home, NBA Finals. It\u2019s a good opportunity. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d",
      "Pacers coach Rick Carlisle has been stressing two key points: fewer turnovers (Indiana had 23 for 32 Oklahoma City points in Game 5) and limiting OKC's offensive rebounding. Those areas must be cleaned up whether Haliburton plays or not.",
      "The Pacers trailed New York 3-2 in the second round last season, came home and won Game 6, then went to Madison Square Garden and won Game 7. Winning from this position is possible, and Carlisle obviously knows it.",
      "\u201cWhat we need to do is buckle down. Stand strong. I anticipate one of the best crowds in the history of Gainbridge Fieldhouse,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cWe've got to find a way. The ultimate is to get to a Game 7. That is the ultimate privilege. It\u2019s the ultimate experience in sports. But we\u2019ve got to take care of home court tomorrow to do that.\u201d",
      "Thunder guard Jalen Williams, who had 40 points in Game 5, didn't get a ton of calls and texts after the highest-scoring playoff game of his career.",
      "Then again, his friends know he's not on the phone much right now.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I try not to answer my phone as much, even though that probably sounded like I\u2019m a jerk,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThere\u2019s just a lot of highs and lows throughout the series. You don\u2019t get as many texts if you don\u2019t play well. I try to keep that in perspective, too.\u201d",
      "Since 2000, teams are 25-13 in games where they can win the NBA title.",
      "The Thunder are aiming to go 1-0 in such games this year, something 20 teams have done in the last 25 seasons. The NBA's most recent champion, Boston, needed two tries at it last season before ousting Dallas.",
      "If the Thunder win Game 6 \u2014 or Game 7 \u2014 it would push Oklahoma City's win total for the season to 84, including playoffs.",
      "And that would be rare air. Only three teams have won 84 or more games in a season: the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors won 88 (and lost the NBA Finals), the 1995-96 Chicago Bulls won 87 games, and the 1996-97 Bulls won 84.",

      "Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said Wednesday that he never seriously considered retirement after last year's loss to Philadelphia in the Super Bowl",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Travis Kelce said the decision to return for his 13th season with the Kansas City Chiefs wasn't much of a decision at all.",
      "In fact, the four-time All-Pro tight end indicated Wednesday that No. 14 isn't out of the question.",
      "\u201cI got one year on this contract, I know that. And we'll try to figure out something for next year,\u201d Kelce said after the second day of the Chiefs' mandatory three-day minicamp, which was moved partially indoors because of lightning in the area.",
      "\u201cThe Chiefs organization knows how much I love them. I can't see myself playing anywhere else,\" Kelce continued. \u201cWe'll deal with (2026) down the road, when the time is right. But right now, I'm focused on winning a championship this year.\u201d",
      "The question of whether the 35-year-old would hang up his cleats was among the biggest to follow the Chiefs' lopsided loss to the Eagles in the Super Bowl. While he still played at a high level last season, Kelce's production dipped noticeably \u2014 97 catches for 823 yards and just three touchdowns for a team that won 15 regular-season games.",
      "Throw in Kelce's myriad business interests, including a successful media career thanks in part to his popular podcast, and a long-term relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift, and it made sense to wonder how much longer he would play.",
      "Yet it only took a matter of weeks for Kelce to decide to chase another championship.",
      "Part of it was the way last season's run had ended. Kelce had a throwback game in the divisional round against Houston with seven catches for 117 yards, but he only had four for 39 in the 40-22 loss to the Eagles in the Super Bowl.",
      "\u201cReally didn't feel like it was my last game. Just felt like I had a lot more to prove,\u201d he said. \u201cYeah, you want to let the emotions die down; you don't want to make a decision off initial emotions. Once they died down, I felt like I still had that fire in my chest to come in and keep building and chase another Super Bowl, man.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs made it to the Super Bowl despite playing most of the season without their top two wide receivers, Rashee Rice and Marquise Brown, both of whom are fully healthy now after their injuries. They also made it despite massive issues at left tackle, which the Chiefs hope to have solved by drafting Ohio State standout Josh Simmons in the first round.",
      "Now, they have a motivated \u2014 and noticeably slimmer \u2014 Kelce back at tight end. There were reports that he had dropped about 25 pounds since the end of last season, though Kelce insisted that may have been an exaggeration.",
      "\u201cDon't believe all you read on the internet, guys. I'm down some weight from the end of last season \u2014 last year \u2014 but each year is different, man. You have to rebuild it,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, I had some time to really focus on some form running and some things early in the offseason that I didn't have time for last year. Certainly feeling good and I think it'll pay off.\u201d",
      "Patrick Mahomes certainly hopes so. After leading one of the NFL's most productive offenses early in his career, Mahomes has struggled to get the Chiefs on track the past couple of seasons, largely because of injuries and offensive line trouble.",
      "Still, the Chiefs' star quarterback said he never put any pressure on Kelce to return for another season.",
      "\u201cI think you have in the back of your mind, for anybody that's played a lot of seasons, there's always the chance if they're going to come back and put in the work,\" Mahomes said. \u201cFor him, I think it was just recalibrating, seeing where he was at, and from what I've seen, he's ready to go. He's put in the work this offseason and he's excited to make another run at it.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs wrap up their three-day minicamp on Thursday, then break for about a month, before reuniting at Missouri Western State University for training camp. And while the thought of spending a few weeks living in college dorm rooms probably doesn't sound very enticing to Kelce, the prospect of starting another championship run there clearly drives him.",
      "\u201cI love this game. It's still my childhood dream,\u201d Kelce said. \u201cWhen I really thought about it this offseason, I got back to wanting to focus on this game and getting the most out of this game as I can, while I'm still putting on the cleats and pads. This will always be No. 1 in terms of my business world and career path.\u201d",

She set the world record mark of 4:07.64 nearly two years ago during a Diamond League meet in Monaco.",
      "\u201cI think breaking four will really cement my legacy,\u201d Kipyegon said in a Zoom call on Wednesday. \u201cThe next generation is looking up to us to show them the way and this is what I\u2019m doing now. ...

      "What she's doing in workouts now has already proven highly successful. She won her third straight 1,500 Olympic title in Paris last August. A month before that, she broke her own 1,500 record on the same track where she will run next Thursday.",
      "\u201cFor me, I would say being mentally strong and believing in everything I do,\u201d she said of preparing for big moments. \u201cBelieving in the training, believing in waking up to empower the next generation, believing in everything that has been from my younger time when I was running barefoot to where I am now. It has really given me that drive to wake up and go for training and just be strong.\u201d",
      "She will be wearing the latest innovations from Nike, too, from her aerodynamic track suit to her spikes. Should she break the mark, it would be subject to ratification by World Athletics.",
      "Fellow Kenyan runner, longtime friend and training partner Eliud Kipchoge has been providing emotional support. He had an event set up for him in 2019, when he ran a marathon in 1:59:40 to break the 2-hour marathon barrier at the INEOS 1:59 Challenge in Austria. The mark wasn\u2019t ratified by the sport's governing body.",
      "\u201cIt will be lovely to see Eliud after the finish line,\u201d said Kipyegon, who's a four-time world champion. \u201cI get positive messages from around the world that I can do it. ... It really motivates me a lot going on to this challenge. I know it will not be easy, but I\u2019m going to try my best and we will see what the finish line offers.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s eager for the challenge to show the next generation of female runners that anything is possible. That includes her young daughter, Alyn.",
      "\u201cYou have to dream and just be patient for it,\u201d Kipyegon said.",
      "Same with her quest next week, which she will approach in increments.",
      "\u201cYou have to dream of how will I cross the 800 mark? How will I cross that 1,200 mark?\" Kipyegon explained. \"It\u2019s the repetition of, \u2018I have to be myself and just think of how will I shed the seven seconds?\u2019",

      "College sports was once rooted in tradition, school pride and loyalty, but those expectations are changing in a landscape where athletes have won the ability to transfer season to season, year to year",
      "Hailey Van Lith was one year away from tying a bow on a traditional college career at Louisville and being cemented as one of the most decorated four-year starters in Cardinals history. She had just led her team to its third straight Elite Eight appearance and put up career-high numbers, including 19.7 points per game.",
      "But the rising senior from Wenatchee, Washington, had other plans. With WNBA aspirations on her mind, Van Lith swapped Louisville red for LSU purple and gold and embarked on a new journey in Baton Rouge. Her lone season included another run to the Elite Eight and it was back to the transfer portal.",
      "Coach Mark Campbell\u2019s pro-style offense caught her eye, and she decided her fifth and final year of eligibility would be spent at TCU.",
      "College sports was once rooted in tradition, school pride and loyalty, but those expectations are changing if not fading in a landscape where athletes have won the ability to transfer season to season, year to year. Some are painted as disloyal or selfish but Van Lith and others don't see it that way.",
      "\u201cWhenever you transfer, you always expect pushback,\u201d Van Lith told The Associated Press. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many podcasts I\u2019ve seen on people discussing my choices to go to this school and that school, and the theories that are thrown out there are all wrong. But it\u2019s just, you learn to live in harmony with that, and at the end of the day, I just decided I\u2019m no longer going to let false assumptions disrupt my peace.\u201d",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions, Van Lith said, is that her transfer decisions were guided by NIL compensation. She was able to look past accusations of being a \u201cmoney chaser\u201d or a \u201ctrophy chaser\u201d and find solace knowing onlookers didn\u2019t have the full picture.",
      "\u201cMultiple of the schools that I went to, I actually never got a check from,\" she said. \"I think that in transfer culture now, a lot of people automatically assume that it has to do with the collective money or now I guess it\u2019s revenue share. But it just depends on the person, and for me, it was all basketball decisions.\u201d",
      "Ann Skeet, senior director of Leadership Ethics at Santa Clara\u2019s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics, said all parties should be held to the same standards. Coaches and athletic directors take new jobs, navigating buyouts and ill will along the way.",
      "\u201cI do think one of the realities of sport in this day and age is that people are making changes more often than they used to,\u201d Skeet said. \u201cHow they communicate what their decision is, how much time they give people, how frequently they\u2019re changing teams, all of those things should be considered, and I think it\u2019s fair to hold the coaches and players to equal standards.\u201d",
      "Skeet acknowledged the pressure on athletes navigating a new, professional-like industry at a young age. Millions of dollars in name, image and likeness compensation is already flowing even before schools start cutting checks after July 1 under the NCAA antitrust settlement.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, NIL is bringing market pressures to college sports in a way that we haven\u2019t experienced before, and so players are having to trade off and think about what serves their own personal interests vs. what serves the team interests in ways that they haven\u2019t had to consider in the past,\" she said.",
      "While Van Lith was deciding her future, running back Ray Davis was awaiting his. In his sole season at Kentucky, Davis rushed for 1,129 yards on 199 carries and led the SEC with 21 touchdowns from scrimmage. His production was enough to garner interest from NFL scouts.",
      "Similar to Van Lith, Davis\u2019s winding road to the pros involved several stops. Before Kentucky, he had two-year stints at Temple (2019-2021) and Vanderbilt (2021-2023). Transferring to Kentucky meant Davis would suit up for his third team in five years, and he knew moving from one SEC school to the next could stir the pot. The decision wasn\u2019t an easy one.",
      "\u201cIt was super difficult,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIt took days, literally almost weeks to just really make a decision. And when I made the decision, I just had to live with it. I couldn\u2019t think twice about it. I had to be confident.\u201d",
      "The move paid off. Davis gained national attention and was selected by the Buffalo Bills in the fourth round of the 2024 draft. But while his draft stock soared, the backlash from transferring a second time took a toll.",
      "\u201cMentally it sucks because, you know, as a kid when you\u2019re 18, 19 or whatever, you\u2019re being told, \u2018Hey he\u2019s leaving because he\u2019s disloyal,\u2019 and that\u2019s not what it is,\u201d Davis said.",
      "He focused on what he could control.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really about how you handle it yourself, how you internalize it yourself, and how you go about walking in the building each and every day. If you be like, `Ah, people are looking at me like I\u2019m not an honest and disloyal person,\u2019 then that\u2019s going to hurt you mentally. But if you walk into a place where you\u2019re confident in who you are, then I think you\u2019ll succeed,\u201d Davis told AP.",
      "Transfer decisions, regardless of the underlying factor, can lead to unfavorable public perceptions \u2014 or worse. A 2024 study found a cross-section of abusive content directed toward college athletes on social media.",
      "\u201cIt certainly is their right to transfer, but then they will also develop whatever reputation they develop as a result of the choices they make. So people who transfer multiple times are going to be identified in that way,\u201d Skeet said. \u201cIt goes with the territory, as they say.\u201d",
      "Both Van Lith and Davis noted the irony in receiving blowback when team personnel can seek new ventures without repercussions.",
      "\u201cCoaches leave. Directors leave. Everybody has the opportunity to leave. So for players, we\u2019ve got to have that opportunity too,\u201d Davis said.",
      "Added Van Lith: \u201cA lot of times, the loyalty is placed on the responsibility of the players, but you see coaches leave all the time to better their financial situation, to make more money, to do better for their family. When people talk about loyalty, I really challenge them to put into perspective, if they would feel the same if a coach left.\u201d",

      "Julie Vanloo\u2019s ability to communicate in four languages has been crucial as the expansion Golden State Valkyries develop chemistry and find ways to make sure everyone can understand a given play or defensive set",
      "OAKLAND, Calif. -- Julie Vanloo smiled as the memory came back to her and the nursery rhyme words from her childhood became familiar again and just flowed.",
      "A short phrase in French from her days as a schoolgirl in Belgium.",
      "Vanloo\u2019s ability to communicate in multiple languages has been crucial as the expansion Golden State Valkyries develop chemistry and find ways to make sure everyone can understand a given play or defensive set.",
      "Her teammates are often in awe.",
      "Part of an international roster on the Valkyries, Vanloo\u2019s language skills have helped everybody get comfortable on a team that has been changing by the week. Vanloo, Temi F\u00e1gb\u00e9nl\u00e9 (Great Britain) and Janelle Salaun (France) are currently competing for their countries in the EuroBasket 2025 tournament.",
      "That has led to much mixing and matching for coach Natalie Nakase, who has counted on players like Vanloo making key assists on and off the court.",
      "The Valkyries (5-6) will host Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever on Thursday night in their sixth home game \u2014 all of them sellouts \u2014 at Chase Center.",
      "Vanloo will miss the fanfare of that matchup as she plays for Belgium \u2014 and she'll certainly brush up on her language skills while away.",
      "For Vanloo, a commitment to building her speaking skills became as important as her basketball talent as she dreamt of reaching the WNBA. She speaks English, French, Italian and Flemish, the dialect of Dutch spoken in her home country.",
      "\u201cSlowly you step up to the next level and when we go to high school and we\u2019re 12 years old, we really start to drill it, we start to learn it, both English and French,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like six to nine hours per week we really learn English and French in Belgium. All of our series and even our cartoons are in English, we use subtitles for French so that\u2019s how we actually learned the accent and everything.",
      "\u201cSo that\u2019s for all the kids out there, language is important, it\u2019s an advantage. I think you are rich when you know multiple languages because it\u2019s just easy to communicate and to create a bond with people.\u201d",
      "She didn't always love it and she's not always perfect. But Vanloo has remained vigilant about learning.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to come play professionally, to come to the league one day. If I have a goal, nobody\u2019s going to stop me,\" she said. \u201cFor basketball, I was very, very motivated to learn languages.\u201d",
      "Vanloo was selected by the Valkyries from Washington in the expansion draft last December.",
      "She is one of eight non-American players on Golden State's roster representing six countries \u2014 Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Italy and the United Kingdom.",
      "Kayla Thornton played in Korea and realizes the challenges of trying to live in a place where she doesn't speak the language. She tries to use a few words with her teammates when possible.",
      "\u201cI do pick up on some of the stuff because we do have Italians and we do have French,\u201d Thornton said. \u201cWhen I do hear it I kind of do catch on, I do know a few phrases. Most of the time they teach you their lingo, and that\u2019s the bad lingo.\u201d",
      "Vanloo's ability to share her basketball expertise and the basics takes pressure off Nakase.",
      "\u201cI think what\u2019s really helped is Julie can translate for all of them. Julie speaks everyone\u2019s language so that\u2019s kind of been really key, just how we can connect that way,\u201d Nakase said. \u201cImagine going to another country and you have no idea. When I played in Germany I really wasn\u2019t understanding but I made sure I paid attention. So it\u2019s been nice to have Julie because she\u2019s listening, she\u2019s doing extra for a teammate.\u201d",
      "Laeticia Amihere of Canada, a native French speaker who didn\u2019t make the opening game roster but has since re-signed with the team, counts on Vanloo. So does rookie guard Carla Leite, who's from France and is working to gain confidence speaking English.",
      "\u201cA lot of us speak French and a lot of us speak different languages so to be able to use that on the court to our advantage I think it\u2019s been great,\u201d Amihere said. \u201cAnd she\u2019s obviously helping out the French and the French are helping us all just work cohesively and try to find a way we can communicate easily. It\u2019s been cool hearing different languages in the locker room. I\u2019m used to it. Some people may not be used to it but I think it\u2019s dope.\u201d",
      "Kyara Linskens is also from Belgium. She can relate to Vanloo\u2019s drive to reach the WNBA and do all the little things \u2014 like learning multiple languages \u2014 to get there.",
      "\u201cI realized (the importance), because I wanted this,\u201d Vanloo said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you, when I want something I\u2019m going to do it until I can\u2019t.\u201d",

      "Russian luge athletes will be banned from competing at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics even as individuals with neutral status, the sliding sport's governing body decided Wednesday.",
      "The International Luge Federation has kept Russian athletes from competing in major international luge events \u2014 such as World Cups and world championships \u2014 since the 2021-22 season in response to the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war.",
      "At a meeting of the FIL congress in Tampere, Finland, officials voted 24-7, with one invalid ballot, to extend that ban that was first put in place in 2022 and extended again in 2024. A second vote then took place on the notion of letting Russian sliders try to compete under a neutral flag at the upcoming Olympics; that was defeated 24-8.",
      "\u201cThe Congress has made its position clear,\u201d FIL president Einars Fogelis said. \u201cThis outcome reflects our collective responsibility to uphold fair and safe competition. We fully respect the diversity of views within our community, especially from our athletes.\u201d",
      "The Milan-Cortina Olympics open on Feb. 6.",

      "Also unclear: if any Russian sleds would have had a legitimate hope of qualifying even if they were allowed to try. Without being on the circuits in more than three years, it\u2019s impossible to assess which athletes would be competitive enough to secure Olympic bids.",
      "There were 28 sliders from Russia \u2014 10 in luge, six in skeleton and 12 in bobsled \u2014 at the 2022 Beijing Games, though they competed under the Russian Olympic Committee flag and not the actual Russian flag. That was part of the sanctions levied against Russia for the state-sponsored doping scandal that overshadowed the 2014 Sochi Olympics.",

      "At the 2024 Paris Olympics, Russia and military ally Belarus were excluded from team sports but athletes in individual sports could apply for neutral status to compete. A total of 32 accepted invitations from the International Olympic Committee after passing eligibility tests that included not publicly supporting the war and not having ties to military and state security agencies.",
      "The FIL reviewed the results of an anonymous polling of luge athletes who were surveyed about the prospect of letting Russian athletes resume sliding. It said the survey \u201crevealed a broad range of concerns and opinions regarding safety, Olympic quotas, anti-doping compliance, and fairness.\u201d",

      "Gupta and Tygart recommended a host of reforms for WADA, most of which revolve around ensuring independence, which they say cannot be accomplished under the current model that calls on the International Olympic Committee to supply half of WADA's money.",
      "Gupta also pressed for the United States to regain a seat on WADA's executive committee that it lost in the aftermath of the dues flareup.",
      "Also testifying was Katie McLaughlin, a member of the U.S. 4x200 freestyle team that won a silver medal at the 2021 Olympics. The Americans finished second to a Chinese team that had two swimmers whose positives were erased after WADA declined to look further into the contamination case.",
      "\u201cIt was devastating, honestly,\u201d McLaughlin said of hearing the news about the doping case. \u201cI was taken aback and heartbroken. I spent a lot of my career trusting in the powers that be, and it was really sad to find out that's someone who could not be trusted, meaning WADA.\u201d",
      "The investigator WADA hired to look into the Chinese doping case ruled that WADA had acted reasonably in not pursuing the Chinese case but still called it \u201ccurious\u201d that the agency did not further pursue facts that didn't line up with the normal handling of contamination cases.",
      "Fitzgerald, the WADA spokesperson, said the agency did, in fact, address some of the concerns in the report, especially about the way contaminations cases are handled.",
      "\u201cAs highlighted by the Chinese cases and many others, the issue of contamination is real and growing and it is crucial that WADA and its partners address it head on,\u201d he said.",
      "Tygart led off his testimony claiming the Chinese case had potentially impacted 96 medals from the 2021 and 2024 Olympics.",
      "WADA argued with that, with Fitzgerald reiterating the agency's long-held legal position that, given the complexities of the evidence, had it taken appeals to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, it would have lost all of them.",

    "story": [
      "Bangladesh piled up a mammoth 484 for nine on a rain-curtailed day 2 of the first Test in Galle against Sri Lanka",
      "GALLE, Sri Lanka -- Bangladesh rode on the broad shoulders of their veteran Mushfiqur Rahim to pile up a mammoth 484 for nine on a rain-curtailed day 2 of the first Test against Sri Lanka in Galle.",
      "It is their fourth highest total in the longer format against Sri Lanka.",
      "On a pitch that\u2019s expected to break up, Mushfiqur dug in deep putting together a masterful 163 that lasted more than eight hours. He faced 350 deliveries, blending granite-like defense with the occasional flourish to lead the charge.",
      "The old warhorse stitched together two crucial stands that wrested the momentum away from the hosts. First came a record-breaking 264-run partnership with captain Najmul Hossain Shanto, who looked in sublime touch during his knock of 148. Shanto, though, fell against the run of play \u2014 lured into a false stroke by Asitha Fernando and holing out to Angelo Mathews at mid-off, a sharp catch.",
      "Undeterred, Mushfiqur then forged another valuable stand \u2014 this time worth 149 runs \u2014 with the free-spirited Litton Das, whose shot-making added zip to the innings. However, both set batters were dismissed in the space of nine deliveries just as they threatened to push Bangladesh past 500.",
      "Sri Lanka resorted to bowling a negative line, peppering the leg-side and starving the batters of scoring opportunities. It was a tactic born of desperation, but it bore fruit. Das was dismissed trying to reverse sweep debutant Tharindu Rathnayake \u2014 the top edge ballooning to the keeper.",
      "The old ball started reverse swinging and brought some late cheer for the hosts. Milan Rathnayake, the bustling right-arm seamer, picked up three wickets in a post-tea spell as Bangladesh lost five wickets for 26 runs \u2014 a collapse that gave Sri Lanka some hope.",
      "Fernando, fresh off a county stint in the UK with Glamorgan, returned three wickets as well. Though not operating at full throttle following a recent illness, he showed why he\u2019s Sri Lanka\u2019s pace spearhead, mixing up sharp bouncers with pinpoint yorkers to good effect.",
      "Rathnayake, the debutant, had three scalps to his name, but the biggest letdown was Prabath Jayasuriya. The usually reliable left-arm spinner toiled for 48 wicketless overs, finding neither bite nor bounce on a surface that usually suits him.",
      "Despite Sri Lanka\u2019s late fightback, the day \u2014 and perhaps the match \u2014 belonged to Mushfiqur. His love affair with Galle continues to bloom, with 482 runs in four innings at the venue. Only Pakistan\u2019s Younis Khan (497) and Australia\u2019s Usman Khawaja (490) have scored more at the ground among visiting batters.",
      "For a side that\u2019s beaten Sri Lanka just once in 26 previous Test attempts, Bangladesh have finally found themselves in the driver\u2019s seat. If their bowlers can now hit the right lengths and apply scoreboard pressure, they might just achieve something special in Galle.",

      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don\u2019t return as expected",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 \u201cHave you seen the cats?\u201d",
      "That's a common refrain in my household because our two felines, Maple and Juniper, can venture outside through a flap in the backdoor. Like many other London house cats, they're free to come and go, roaming the surrounding backyards and beyond, equipped with microchips to identify them if they get lost.",
      "If your cat likes to prowl outdoors for long stretches, or your dog has a tendency to run off, it can be distressing when they don't return as expected.",
      "If you're worried about your furry friend's whereabouts, technology can help you keep tabs on them.",
      "Dedicated pet trackers are collar-worn devices that typically use GPS signals to pinpoint the location of the animal wearing them. They use a 4G cellphone signal or your home Wi-Fi connection to relay the position to a smartphone app.",
      "There are many products on the market. Tractive, Jiobit and Pawfit are among brands that offer trackers for both dogs and cats. Devices for the latter are generally smaller and lighter.",
      "Dog trackers with integrated collars are available from Fi and Whistle. PetTracer is a cat collar that uses both GPS and radio signals from a home base station. FitBark, also for dogs, has an Apple Watch app to monitor location and other activity.",
      "Garmin has a range of GPS dog collars that work with handheld devices resembling walkie-talkies, but they're pricey and aimed at outdoors enthusiasts like hunters.",
      "Most trackers let you designate a safe zone on a map, usually your house and surrounding area, and alert you if your pet has left it.",
      "They usually operate on the 4G LTE spectrum commonly used by wireless carriers. It typically has the longest range of any cellular signal, said Andrew Bleiman, Tractive's executive vice president for North America.",
      "That means strong connectivity in most of Europe and North America \u201cunless you\u2019re in a really far flung place like the middle of a national park,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "Exact price depends on brand and model. Most devices sell for less than $100. However, keep in mind you'll also have to pay a subscription fee for the cell service to function.",
      "While that could cost $100 or more a year, for some pet owners it's worth the \u201cpeace of mind,\u201d Bleiman said.",
      "The collars usually have a built-in rechargeable battery but battery life varies. Most will be last at least two to three days before they need charging, and a lot longer in ideal conditions.",
      "One big factor is signal strength. The battery will drain faster if the device has to work harder to pick up the GPS or connect to Wi-Fi. Some save power by not sending coordinates in the safe zone.",
      "Like fitness watches for humans, pet tracking apps offer health and activity monitoring features. You can see how long your cat or dog has spent resting or exercising on a daily or hourly basis.",
      "But be aware, a tracker is \u201cnot going to keep your pet in the backyard,\" Bleiman said. It will only \"alert you when they leave the virtual fence area that you set up.\u201d",
      "This One TechTip was inspired by Maple, who once went AWOL for days. It turned out he was hanging out in a backyard 10 doors down the street. We only found out after the residents got hold of a pet microchip scanner to look up our contact details to let us know so we could retrieve him.",
      "Tractive provided a loaner device to try. Using the included breakaway collar, we put it on Maple, who clearly didn\u2019t like it at first. He dashed out the back door and jumped through a hole in the fence.",
      "Over the next day, I used the Tractive app to monitor his movements. It showed his travels back and forth onto various neighboring properties. He came back to rest for a few hours around midnight, went out to prowl again around 3 a.m, then came back after an hour to nap some more.",
      "It was fascinating to see where he was spending his time. According to the app's \u201cheatmap,\" one of Maple's favorite spots was the same backyard where we had to retrieve him previously.",
      "About 24 hours after I attached the Tractive collar on Maple, I noticed he was no longer wearing it. It had somehow come off.",
      "If you can't find your pet's exact location, or the device gets lost, Tractive has a \u201cradar\u201d feature to pinpoint it with your phone's Bluetooth. Other brands have similar features.",
      "On the app's map, I could see it was in a nearby backyard and that I was getting closer because the circle was getting bigger. But I couldn\u2019t figure out where it was and, not wanting to disturb the neighbors, I gave up.",
      "Bleiman recommends using a harness for cats that don't like collars, but I'm not convinced.",
      "It's common for cats and dogs to be implanted with microchips, with the details added to a database. That makes it much easier to reunite owners with lost dogs and cats, even if they've strayed hundreds of miles away or gone missing for years.",
      "Pet microchips, about the size of a grain of rice implanted just below the skin, are legally required in some European countries. There's no federal law in the U.S., though some places like Hawaii now require them, so check with state or local authorities.",
      "But there's some confusion about what microchips can do. Because they don't have a power supply, they can't be tracked in real time. Whoever finds your pet would need to take it to a vet or a shelter to can scan the device for contact details.",
      "Many pet owners use Bluetooth trackers like Apple's Air Tags, Samsung's SmartTags or similar devices from Tile, Cube and Chipolo, which rely on low-power signals relayed by passing smartphones.",
      "Bluetooth trackers have a range of 100 to 500 feet (30 to 150 meters), depending on the model. The batteries last for months if not longer, and there's no need to pay for a subscription.",
      "However, they're not specifically marketed for pets. That hasn't stopped pet owners, judging from many recommendations they've posted in online forums.",
      "Chipolo advises that its round plastic trackers are only for \u201cin-house pets like house-trained cats and smaller dogs\u201d and warns against using them on \"larger dog breeds and outdoor cats.\"",
      "Still, they can be a solution for some pet owners.",
      "\u201cBluetooth is a totally reasonable solution if you\u2019re in a downtown urban core,\u201d Bleiman said. \u201cBut pets move fast. And if you\u2019re in a wooded park, or you\u2019re in a suburban area \u2014 let alone a more rural or wilderness area \u2014 it\u2019s pretty unlikely your pet is going to be close to a Bluetooth device.\"",

      "For European drone manufacturers, being able to say that their equipment has been tried in war by Ukrainian forces is becoming a sales pitch",
      "LE BOURGET, France -- About once a month, French drone manufacturer Henri Seydoux makes what has become a necessary pilgrimage for many in his business \u2014 he goes to Ukraine.",
      "Because for drone technology, there is no harder place to survive than the frontlines of the war against Russia\u2019s invasion, where both sides are using unmanned aerial machines of all shapes and sizes to kill and to observe, reshaping modern warfare.",

But when it\u2019s guys in Ukraine and others saying they\u2019re happy, it has greater value,\" says Bastien Mancini, president and co-founder of French drone manufacturer Delair, which has teamed up with European defense contractor KNDS to supply Ukrainian forces with 100 exploding drones. KNDS' sales literature notes that they are \u201ccombat-proven.\"",
      "Mancini says civilian users of Delair's other non-military drones \u201csee things that work in Ukraine and say to themselves, \u2018It resists jamming, it resists the loss of a radio connection and whatnot and so it\u2019s going to be fine for civilian use, like inspecting electric cables or whatever.\"",
      "\u201cIt really has helped us win markets. It gives people confidence,\" he told The Associated Press at the Paris Air Show, a major shop-window for the aviation and defense industries.",
      "Henri Seydoux, the founder and head of French drone maker Parrot, says Ukraine is \u201cfascinating\u201d from a drone-technology perspective because \u201cit changes so quickly, there are new ideas non-stop.\u201d He's been making regular trips since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 to meet Ukrainian drone manufacturers, drone software developers and the military authorities.",
      "\u201cEvery quarter, the situation changes completely,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cEvery company, let\u2019s say, that makes military equipment or every army is very interested by drones. But the ones that really use them and understand how to use them is the Ukrainians.\"",
      "For Ukraine, trying to defend against swarms of Russian drones that target cities and waves of drone-supported Russian troops is a matter of survival. So, too, is finding workarounds to counter electronic warfare systems that Russia deploys to jam and disable Ukrainian drones, igniting what has become a drone-technology arms race between the two sides and for manufacturers outside of Ukraine, too.",
      "Small drones that drop bombs and explode against targets \u2014 mass-produced at a fraction of the cost of other more complex weapons systems that its allies have supplied \u2014 have become increasingly vital for Ukraine's resistance. Its Defense Ministry has said that it plans to buy 4.5 million drones this year, all Ukrainian-made, that allow their operators to see what the machines see, so they can guide the flights in real time \u2014 exploding in a Russian trench, for example, or even against a single enemy soldier. That's three times more drones than the ministry bought last year, it says.",
      "\u201cDrones saved Ukraine,\u201d said Alex Vorobei, the Ukrainian sales representative for Ailand Systems, a Ukrainian start-up developing a drone that detects land mines.",
      "Vorobei and others in the drone business say that manufacturers not involved in Ukraine risk being left behind.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re in the defense field and still not in Ukraine, it means you are nowhere,\" Vorobei said at the Paris show.",
      "A micro surveillance drone unveiled by Parrot at the Paris show has a nod to Ukraine in its name \u2014 the Anafi UKR \u2014 and also has been field-tested in what Seydoux describes as the \u201cvery harsh environment\u201d on the frontline. It\u2019s equipped with artificial intelligence technology to enable it to find its way when radio and navigational signals are jammed.",
      "Parrot says the drone\u2019s ready-for-war resilience and features also make it a good fit for law enforcement operations, such as monitoring crowds, tracking suspects or keeping watch over borders, and for rescue services in remote areas or during fires and accidents when navigational signals might go down.",
      "Ukraine has been \u201ca real laboratory or test for us, to see if our products worked,\u201d said Delair's Mancini. Its Oskar exploding drone, which has polystyrene wings, carries a half-kilogram (one pound) warhead to detonate against troops and lightly armored vehicles.",
      "Delair developed it in under a year, repurposing one of its civilian drones that was already used in France for mapping and inspecting power cables, and hardening it for Ukraine with technology to resist Russian jamming.",
      "\"Five or 10 years ago, lots of people were asking themselves, \u2019Are drones really useful for something?' No one is asking that question today,\" he said.",

      "Amazon is gearing up to make as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo",
      "HAYWARD, Calif. -- Amazon is gearing up to make as many as 10,000 robotaxis annually at a sprawling plant near Silicon Valley as it prepares to challenge self-driving cab leader Waymo. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also vying to join the autonomous race.",
      "The 220,000-square-foot (20,440-square-meters) robotaxi factory announced Wednesday heralds a new phase in Amazon's push into a technological frontier that began taking shape in 2009, when Waymo was launched as a secret project within Google.",
      "Amazon began eyeing the market five years ago when it shelled out $1.2 billion for self-driving startup Zoox, which will be the brand behind a robotaxi service that plans to begin transporting customers in Las Vegas late this year before expanding into San Francisco next year.",
      "Zoox, conceived in 2014, will be trying to catch up to Waymo, which began operating robotaxis in Phoenix nearly five years ago then charging for rides in San Francisco in 2023 before expanding into Los Angeles and Austin, Texas. Waymo says it has already more than 10 million paid rides while other would-be rivals such as Amazon and Tesla are still fine-tuning their self-driving technology while tackling other challenges, such how to ramp up their fleet.",
      "Amazon feels like has addressed that issue with Zoox's manufacturing plant that spans across the equivalent of three-and-a-half football fields located in Hayward, California \u2014 about 17 miles (27 kilometers) north of a factory where Tesla makes some of the electric vehicles that Musk believes will eventually be able to operate without a driver behind the wheel.",
      "Since moving into the former bus manufacturing factory in 2023, Zoox has transformed it into a high-tech facility where its boxy, gondola-like vehicles are put together and tested along a 21-station assembly line. For now, Zoox is only making one robotaxi per day, but by next year hopes to be churning them out at the rate of three vehicles per hour.",
      "By 2027, Zoox hopes to making 10,000 robotaxis annually in Hayward for a fleet that it hopes to take into other major markets, including Miami, Los Angeles and Atlanta. Although Zoox will be assembling its robotaxis in the U.S., about half of the parts are imported from outside the country, according to company officials.",
      "\u201cIt's an exciting time to be heading on this journey,\u201d Zoox CEO Aicha Evans said during a Tuesday tour of the robotaxi factory that she co-hosted with Jesse Levinson, the company's co-founder and chief technology officer.",
      "Although Zoox will be lagging well behind, it believes it can lure passengers with vehicles that look more like carriages that cars with seating for up to four passengers. Waymo, in contrast, builds its self-driving technology on to cars made by other major automakers, making its robotaxi look similar to vehicles steered by humans. Zoox isn't even bothering to put a steering wheel in its robotaxis.",
      "As it continues to test its robotaxis in Las Vegas, Zoox recently struck a partnership to give rides to guests of Reorts World. It's also still testing its robotaxis in San Francisco, where Waymo already has turned driverless cars into an everyday site in a city that has been renowned for cable cars since the 1870s. While testing in San Francisco last month, a minor collision between a Zoox robotaxi and a person riding an electric scooter last month prompted the company to issue a voluntary recall to update its self-driving technology. No injuries were reported in the incident.",
      "Tesla is still angling to compete against Waymo too, although it remains unclear when Musk will fuflil his long-running promise to build the world's largest robotaxi service. Musk still hasn't given up on the goal, though his current ambitions are more modest than they were in 2019. when he predicted Tesla would be running a fleet of 1 million robotaxis by now. He is currently aiming for a limited rollout of Tesla robotaxis in Austin this Sunday, although that date could change because Musk is \u201cbeing super paranoid about safety.\u201d",
      "Zoox, in contrast, is planning to operate 500 to 1,000 of its robotaxis in small to medium-sized markets and about 2,000 robotaxis in major cities where it eventually operates, according to Evans. The company thinks each robotaxi produced in its Hayward plan should be on the road for about five years, or about 500,000 miles",

      "This adaptability is a skill that long predates the modern age. According to a new study published Wednesday in Nature, ancient Homo sapiens developed the flexibility to survive by finding food and other resources in a wide variety of difficult habitats before they dispersed from Africa about 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cOur superpower is that we are ecosystem generalists,\u201d said Eleanor Scerri, an evolutionary archaeologist at the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology in Jena, Germany.",
      "Our species first evolved in Africa around 300,000 years ago. While prior fossil finds show some groups made early forays outside the continent, lasting human settlements in other parts of the world didn't happen until a series of migrations around 50,000 years ago.",
      "\u201cWhat was different about the circumstance of the migrations that succeeded \u2014 why were humans ready this time?\u201d said study co-author Emily Hallett, an archaeologist at Loyola University Chicago.",
      "Earlier theories held that Stone Age humans might have made a single important technological advance or developed a new way of sharing information, but researchers haven\u2019t found evidence to back that up.",
      "This study took a different approach by looking at the trait of flexibility itself.",
      "The scientists assembled a database of archaeological sites showing human presence across Africa from 120,000 to 14,000 years ago. For each site, researchers modeled what the local climate would have been like during the time periods that ancient humans lived there.",
      "\u201cThere was a really sharp change in the range of habitats that humans were using starting around 70,000 years ago,\u201d Hallet said. \u201cWe saw a really clear signal that humans were living in more challenging and more extreme environments.\u201d",
      "While humans had long survived in savanna and forests, they shifted into everything from from dense rainforests to arid deserts in the period leading up to 50,000 years ago, developing what Hallet called an \"ecological flexibility that let them succeed.\u201d",
      "While this leap in abilities is impressive, it\u2019s important not to assume that only Homo sapiens did it, said University of Bordeaux archaeologist William Banks, who was not involved in the research.",
      "Other groups of early human ancestors also left Africa and established long-term settlements elsewhere, including those that evolved into Europe\u2019s Neanderthals, he said.",
      "The new research helps explain why humans were ready to expand across the world way back when, he said, but it doesn\u2019t answer the lasting question of why only our species remains today.",

      "When temperatures heat up, nocturnal Bogong moths fly about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) to cool down in caves by the Australian Alps. They later return home to breed and die.",
      "Birds routinely navigate by starlight, but the moths are the first known invertebrates, or creatures without a backbone, to find their way across such long distances using the stars.",
      "Scientists have long wondered how the moths travel to a place they've never been. A previous study hinted that Earth's magnetic field might help steer them in the right direction, along with some kind of visual landmark as a guide.",
      "Since stars appear in predictable patterns each night, scientists suspected they might help lead the way. They placed moths in a flight simulator that mimicked the night sky above them and blocked out the Earth's magnetic field, noting where they flew. Then they scrambled the stars and saw how the moths reacted.",
      "When the stars were as they should be, the moths flapped in the right direction. But when the stars were in random places, the moths were disoriented. Their brain cells also got excited in response to specific orientations of the night sky.",
      "The findings were published Wednesday in the journal Nature.",
      "It \u201cwas a very clean, impressive demonstration that the moths really are using a view of the night sky to guide their movements,\u201d said Kenneth Lohmann, who studies animal navigation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and was not involved with the new research.",
      "Researchers don't know what features of the night sky the moths use to find their way. It could be a stripe of light from the Milky Way, a colorful nebula or something else entirely. Whatever it is, the insects seem to rely on that along with Earth's magnetic field to make their journey.",
      "Other animals harness the stars as a guide. Birds take celestial cues as they soar through the skies and dung beetles roll their remains short distances while using the Milky Way to stay on course.",

      "Elon Musk\u2019s X has sued to try to stop New York from requiring reports on how social media platforms define and handle problematic posts",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Elon Musk \u2019s X sued Tuesday to try to stop New York from requiring reports on how social media platforms handle problematic posts \u2014 a regulatory approach that the company successfully challenged in California.",
      "New York's law, which Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul signed late last year, is poised to take effect later this year. X maintains that the measure impinges on free speech rights and on a 1996 federal law that, among other things, lets internet platforms moderate posts as they see fit.",
      "New York is improperly trying \u201cto inject itself into the content-moderation editorial process\u201d by requiring \u201cpolitically charged disclosures\u201d about it, Bastrop, Texas-based X Corp. argues in the suit.",
      "\u201cThe state is impermissibly trying to generate public controversy about content moderation in a way that will pressure social media companies, such as X Corp., to restrict, limit, disfavor or censor certain constitutionally protected content on X that the state dislikes,\u201d says the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James' office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.",
      "The law requires social media companies to report twice a year on whether and how they define hate speech, racist or extremist content, disinformation and some other terms. The platforms also have to detail their content moderation practices and data on the number of posts they flagged, the actions they took, the extent to which the offending material was seen or shared, and more.",
      "Sponsors Sen. Brad Hoylman-Sigal and Assembly Member Grace Lee, both Democrats, have said the measure will make social media more transparent and companies more accountable.",
      "The law applies broadly to social media companies. But X is among those that have faced intense scrutiny in recent years, and in a 2024 letter to an X lobbyist, the sponsors said the company and Musk in particular have a \u201cdisturbing record\u201d that \u201cthreatens the foundations of our democracy.\u201d",
      "The lawmakers wrote before Musk became, for a time, a close adviser and chainsaw-wielding cost-cutter in Republican President Donald Trump's administration. The two billionaires have since feuded and, perhaps, made up.",
      "Since taking over the former Twitter in 2022, Musk, in the name of free speech, has dismantled the company\u2019s Trust and Safety advisory group and stopped enforcing content moderation and hate speech rules that the site followed. He has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists and incentivized engagement on the platform with payouts and content partnerships.",
      "Outside groups have since documented a rise in hate speech and harassment on the platform. X sued a research organization that studies online hate speech \u2013 that lawsuit was dismissed last March.",
      "The New York legislation took a page from a similar law that passed in California \u2014 and drew a similar lawsuit from X.",
      "Last fall, a panel of federal appellate judges blocked portions of the California law, at least temporarily, on free speech grounds. The state subsequently settled, agreeing not to enforce the content-moderation reporting requirements.",

      "A proposal by Senate Republicans would adjust the pace at which some crucial home energy efficiency and electric vehicle tax credits are phased out in timelines different from what House Republicans proposed in the multitrillion-dollar tax bill they pa...",
      "Tax credits for clean energy and home energy efficiency would still be phased out, albeit less quickly, under Senate Republicans' latest proposed changes to a massive tax bill. Electric vehicle incentives and other provisions intended to move the United States away from fossil fuels would be gutted rapidly.",
      "Senate Republicans cast their version of the bill as less damaging to the clean energy industry than the version House Republicans passed last month, but Democrats and advocates criticized it, saying it would still have significant consequences for wind, solar and other projects.",
      "Ultimately, wherever Congress ends up could have a big impact on consumers, companies and others that were depending on tax credits for green energy investments. It could also impact long-term how quickly America transitions to renewable energies.",
      "\u201cThey want everybody to believe that after the flawed House bill, that they have come up with a much more moderate climate approach,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the finance committee, during a conference call with reporters Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, if the early projections on the clean energy cuts are accurate, the Senate Republican bill does almost 90%\" as much damage as the House proposal, added Wyden, who authored clean energy tax credits included in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act passed during former President Joe Biden\u2019s term. \u201cLet\u2019s not get too serious about this new Senate bill being a kinder, gentler approach.\u201d",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association representing investor-owned electric companies, issued a statement applauding the Senate proposal for including \u201cmore reasonable timelines for phasing out energy tax credits.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese modifications are a step in the right direction,\u201d said the statement from Pat Vincent-Collawn, the institute\u2019s interim chief executive officer, adding that the changes balance \u201cbusiness certainty with fiscal responsibility.\u201d",
      "Whether all of the changes will be enacted into law isn't clear yet. The Senate can still modify its proposals before they go to a vote. Any conflicts in the draft legislation will have to be sorted out with the House as the GOP looks to fast-track the bill for a vote by President Donald Trump\u2019s imminent Fourth of July target.",
      "Notably, many Republicans in Congress have advocated to protect the clean-energy credits, which have overwhelmingly benefited Republican congressional districts. A report by the Atlas Public Policy research firm found that 77% of planned spending on credit-eligible projects are in GOP-held House districts.",
      "The clean energy tax credits stem from Biden\u2019s climate law, which aimed to boost to the nation\u2019s transition away from planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and toward renewable energy such as wind and solar power.",
      "The House version of the bill took an ax to many of the credits and effectively made it impossible for wind and solar providers to meet the requirements and timelines necessary to qualify for the incentives. After the House vote, 13 House Republicans lobbied the Senate to preserve some of the clean energy incentives that GOP lawmakers had voted to erase.",
      "Language included Monday in the reconciliation bill from the Senate Finance Committee would still phase out \u2014 though more slowly than House lawmakers envisioned \u2014 some Biden-era green energy tax breaks.",
      "The Senate proposal further \u201cachieves significant savings by slashing Green New Deal spending and targeting waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho and chairman of the committee.",
      "On the chopping block are tax credits for residential rooftop solar installations, ending within 180 days of passage, and a subsidy for hydrogen production. Federal credits for wind and solar would have a longer phaseout than in the House version, but it would still be difficult for developers to meet the rules for beginning construction in order to receive the credit.",
      "At the same time, it would boost support for geothermal, nuclear and hydropower projects that begin construction by 2033.",
      "\u201cThe bill will strip the ability of millions of American families to choose the energy savings, energy resilience, and energy freedom that solar and storage provide,\u201d said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. \u201cIf this bill passes as is, we cannot ensure an affordable, reliable and secure energy system.\u201d",
      "Opponents of the Senate\u2019s text also decry domestic manufacturing job and economic losses as a result.",
      "\u201cThis is a 20-pound sledgehammer swung at clean energy. It would mean higher energy prices, lost manufacturing jobs, shuttered factories, and a worsening climate crisis,\u201d said Jackie Wong, senior vice president for climate and energy at the Natural Resources Defense Council.",
      "The bill would also cancel incentives such as the Energy Efficient Home Improvement credit \u2014 which helps homeowners make improvements such as insulation or heating and cooling systems that reduce their energy usage and energy bills \u2014 180 days after enactment. An incentive for builders constructing new energy-efficient homes and apartments would end 12 months after signing. The House\u2019s proposed end date for both is Dec. 31.",
      "\u201cCanceling these credits would increase monthly bills for American families and businesses,\u201d Steven Nadel, executive director of the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy said in a statement.",
      "The Senate proposal moves up the timeline for ending the consumer electric vehicle tax credit from the end of this year to 180 days after passage. It also cuts the provision that would have extended until the end of 2026 a credit for automakers that had not made 200,000 qualifying EVs for U.S. sale. It would also immediately eliminate the $7,500 credit for leased EVs.",
      "This administration has staunchly gone after EVs amid Trump's targeting of what he calls a \u201cmandate,\u201d incorrectly referring to a Biden-era target for half of new vehicle sales by 2030 be electric.",

      "Built by Alameda, California-based company Saildrone, the vessels will patrol Danish and NATO waters in the Baltic and North Seas, where maritime tensions and suspected sabotage have escalated sharply since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",
      "Their launch comes after two others already joined a NATO patrol on June 6.",
      "Saildrone founder and CEO Richard Jenkins compared the vessels to a \u201ctruck\u201d that carries sensors and uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to give a \u201cfull picture of what's above and below the surface\" to about 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) in the open ocean.",
      "He said that maritime threats like damage to undersea cables, illegal fishing and the smuggling of people, weapons and drugs are going undetected simply because \u201cno one\u2019s observing it.\u201d",
      "Saildrone, he said, is \"going to places ... where we previously didn\u2019t have eyes and ears.\u201d",

      "A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses through precise and fancy formation flying",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- A pair of European satellites have created the first artificial solar eclipses by flying in precise and fancy formation, providing hours of on-demand totality for scientists.",
      "The European Space Agency released the eclipse pictures at the Paris Air Show on Monday. Launched late last year, the orbiting duo have churned out simulated solar eclipses since March while zooming tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth.",
      "Flying 492 feet (150 meters) apart, one satellite blocks the sun like the moon does during a natural total solar eclipse as the other aims its telescope at the corona, the sun's outer atmosphere that forms a crown or halo of light.",
      "It's an intricate, prolonged dance requiring extreme precision by the cube-shaped spacecraft, less than 5 feet (1.5 meters) in size. Their flying accuracy needs to be within a mere millimeter, the thickness of a fingernail. This meticulous positioning is achieved autonomously through GPS navigation, star trackers, lasers and radio links.",
      "Dubbed Proba-3, the $210 million mission has generated 10 successful solar eclipses so far during the ongoing checkout phase. The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "A new poll finds Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his public falling-out with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

The suspect, identified by police as Manuel D. Ruiz, surrendered to authorities Monday morning at a police station outside of Las Vegas.",
      "Ruiz, 41, faces two counts of open murder with a deadly weapon and is being held without bail, jail records show.",

      "In his interview with police after he surrendered, the suspect said he also has a YouTube channel and had been livestreaming from the Strip on the night of the shooting. Ruiz told police began shooting because it looked like one of the victims was reaching for a weapon, according to the report.",
      "Police said no firearms were found on the victims.",
      "The shooting happened on one of the busiest stretches of the Strip. The dancing Bellagio fountains, which soar up to 460 feet (140 meters) into the air, play every 15 minutes on the weekends between 8 p.m. and midnight.",

      "Trump vowed speedy ends to the Israel-Hamas war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, two conflicts that broke out in the previous administration that Trump has labeled \"Biden's wars.\" On the campaign trail, he often railed against \"endless wars\" and mused that he could resolve the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours -- a comment that once in office he walked back as an \"exaggeration.\"",
      "\"He has made comments on all of them that this could be done quickly or easily and that there are solutions to these three problems,\" Miller said. \"And yet, he has not been successful in even identifying what I would consider to be a potentially effective strategy for managing or let alone resolving them.

      "One claim of success on the foreign policy front that Trump frequently makes, and says he can replicate by pushing trade deals, is how he says he stopped the recent fighting between India and Pakistan. Trump's claimed he hasn't received enough credit: \"I got it stopped. I don't think I had one story.\"",

      "In the last few days, he's floated sending Vice President JD Vance and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff to speak with the Iranians while also demanding Iran's \"unconditional surrender.\" Officials have said the U.S. has not been involved in Israel's offensive, while Trump claimed \"we now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.\"",
      "\"His words and deeds are chaotic and inconsistent,\" Miller said of Trump. \"And the notion that he's unpredictable and that helps him certainly hasn't proven to be the case so far in these three conflicts.\"",
      "The White House and Vice President Vance have defended Trump's position on Iran, saying he's long been clear and consistent that the nation can't have a nuclear weapon.",
      "Abrams concedes Trump's messaging might be \"confusing\" but is representative of a rapidly changing situation on the ground in Tehran.",
      "\"One thing he's trying to make clear to the Ayatollah is that if he attacks American ships from bases he's done, that's the end of the regime. That is something any president should do,\" Abrams said.",
      "Peace in Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars remains out of reach",
      "As the administration ramps up its focus on Israel and Iran, other areas are at a standstill.",
      "\"On Gaza, no one has come up with a workable plan,\" Abrams said. \"It's a wicked problem. [Joe] Biden didn\u2019t come up with a plan in his 15 months after October 7 and Trump hasn't come up with a workable one.\"",
      "An initial three-phrase peace deal aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which was brokered by members of both the Biden and Trump administrations, collapsed in March. Since then, proposals for a temporary ceasefire have fallen through.",
      "In Eastern Europe, Trump took a different approach than his predecessor in engaging with both the leaders of Ukraine and Russia, often saying his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin would produce results.",
      "Some progress appeared to be made when Russian and Ukrainian officials held their first face-to-face meeting since the invasion began back in mid-May. But talks have since stalled, with the Trump administration taking a step back while Ukraine and Russia have been intensifying attacks in recent weeks.",
      "\"The president did a lot of huffing and puffing on the need for peace, but he hasn't been prepared to really push Putin in that direction,\" said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who served as the State Department's ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union.",
      "William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine during the Obama administration currently serving as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said Putin is not going to be swayed diplomatically.",
      "\"Putin is going to be swayed by a combination of military and economic pressure,\" Taylor said. \"So President Trump should do that.\"",
      "No new commitments have been made for U.S. arms deliveries to Ukraine and no new sanctions have been placed on Russia, however, and there are now reports that the Trump administration disbanded a group focused on pressuring Russia.",
      "\"For someone who claims to have mastered the art of the deal, this is a pretty spectacular failure,\" Sestanovich said of Trump's approach to the Russia-Ukraine war so far.",
      "Anna Kelly, White House Deputy press secretary, responded to the criticism, saying in a statement, \u201cPresident Trump is leading the world in ending this brutal war, which he inherited from his incompetent predecessor Joe Biden. No one cares about the opinions of armchair quarterback \u2018experts\u2019 who have done nothing to make the world safer.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Farmers, cattle ranchers and hotel and restaurant managers breathed a sigh of relief last week when President Donald Trump ordered a pause to immigration raids that were disrupting those industries and scaring foreign-born workers off the job.",
      "\u201cThere was finally a sense of calm,\u2019\u2019 said Rebecca Shi, CEO of the American Business Immigration Coalition.",
      "That respite didn\u2019t last long.",
      "On Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin declared, \u201cThere will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine (immigration enforcement) efforts. Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability.\u2019\u2019",
      "The flipflop baffled businesses trying to figure out the government\u2019s actual policy, and Shi says now \u201cthere's fear and worry once more.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not a way to run business when your employees are at this level of stress and trauma,\" she said.",
      "Trump campaigned on a promise to deport millions of immigrants working in the United States illegally \u2014 an issue that has long fired up his GOP base. The crackdown intensified a few weeks ago when Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff, gave the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement a quota of 3,000 arrests a day, up from 650 a day in the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "Suddenly, ICE seemed to be everywhere. \u201cWe saw ICE agents on farms, pointing assault rifles at cows, and removing half the workforce,\u2019\u2019 said Shi, whose coalition represents 1,700 employers and supports increased legal immigration.",
      "One ICE raid left a New Mexico dairy with just 20 workers, down from 55. \u201cYou can\u2019t turn off cows,\u2019\u2019 said Beverly Idsinga, the executive director of the Dairy Producers of New Mexico. \u201cThey need to be milked twice a day, fed twice a day.\u2019\u2019",
      "Claudio Gonzalez, a chef at Izakaya Gazen in Los Angeles\u2019 Little Tokyo district, said many of his Hispanic workers \u2014 whether they're in the country legally or not \u2014 have been calling out of work recently due to fears that they will be targeted by ICE. His restaurant is a few blocks away from a collection of federal buildings, including an ICE detention center.",
      "\u201cThey sometimes are too scared to work their shift,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cThey kind of feel like it\u2019s based on skin color.\u201d",
      "In some places, the problem isn\u2019t ICE but rumors of ICE. At cherry-harvesting time in Washington state, many foreign-born workers are staying away from the orchards after hearing reports of impending immigration raids. One operation that usually employs 150 pickers is down to 20. Never mind that there hasn\u2019t actually been any sign of ICE in the orchards.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve not heard of any real raids,\u2019\u2019 said Jon Folden, orchard manager for the farm cooperative Blue Bird in Washington\u2019s Wenatchee River Valley. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard a lot of rumors.\u2019\u2019",
      "Jennie Murray, CEO of the advocacy group National Immigration Forum, said some immigrant parents worry that their workplaces will be raided and they\u2019ll be hauled off by ICE while their kids are in school. They ask themselves, she said: \u201cDo I show up and then my second-grader gets off the school bus and doesn\u2019t have a parent to raise them? Maybe I shouldn\u2019t show up for work.\u2019\u2019",
      "The horror stories were conveyed to Trump, members of his administration and lawmakers in Congress by business advocacy and immigration reform groups like Shi\u2019s coalition. Last Thursday, the president posted on his Truth Social platform that \u201cOur great Farmers and people in the Hotel and Leisure business have been stating that our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\u201d",
      "It was another case of Trump\u2019s political agenda slamming smack into economic reality. With U.S. unemployment low at 4.2%, many businesses are desperate for workers, and immigration provides them.",
      "According to the U.S. Census Bureau, foreign-born workers made up less than 19% of employed workers in the United States in 2023. But they accounted for nearly 24% of jobs preparing and serving food and 38% of jobs in farming, fishing and forestry.",
      "\u201cIt really is clear to me that the people pushing for these raids that target farms and feed yards and dairies have no idea how farms operate,\u201d Matt Teagarden, CEO of the Kansas Livestock Association, said Tuesday during a virtual press conference.",
      "Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, estimated in January that undocumented workers account for 13% of U.S. farm jobs and 7% of jobs in hospitality businesses such as hotels, restaurants and bars.",
      "The Pew Research Center found last year that 75% of U.S. registered voters \u2014 including 59% of Trump supporters \u2014 agreed that undocumented immigrants mostly fill jobs that American citizens don\u2019t want. And an influx of immigrants in 2022 and 2023 allowed the United States to overcome an outbreak of inflation without tipping into recession.",
      "In the past, economists estimated that America\u2019s employers could add no more than 100,000 jobs a month without overheating the economy and igniting inflation. But economists Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson of the Brookings Institution calculated that because of the immigrant arrivals, monthly job growth could reach 160,000 to 200,000 without exerting upward pressure on prices.",
      "Now Trump\u2019s deportation plans \u2014 and the uncertainty around them \u2014 are weighing on businesses and the economy.",
      "\u201cThe reality is, a significant portion of our industry relies on immigrant labor \u2014 skilled, hardworking people who\u2019ve been part of our workforce for years. When there are sudden crackdowns or raids, it slows timelines, drives up costs, and makes it harder to plan ahead,\u201d says Patrick Murphy, chief investment officer at the Florida building firm Coastal Construction and a former Democratic member of Congress. \u201c We\u2019re not sure from one month to the next what the rules are going to be or how they\u2019ll be enforced. That uncertainty makes it really hard to operate a forward-looking business.\u201d",
      "Adds Douglas Holtz Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and now president of the conservative American Action Forum think tank: \u201cICE had detained people who are here lawfully and so now lawful immigrants are afraid to go to work ... All of this goes against other economic objectives the administration might have. The immigration policy and the economic policy are not lining up at all.\u2019\u2019",

      "ICE said it raided the Delta Downs Racetrack, Hotel and Casino in Calcasieu Parish on Monday alongside other state and federal agencies, including the FBI and the U.S. Border Patrol. The raid occurred despite a recent Trump administration directive for immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels due to concerns over the economic impact of aggressive enforcement.",
      "Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and the main architect of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, has pushed ICE to aim for at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "ICE said authorities had \u201creceived intelligence\u201d that businesses operating at the racetrack's stables employed \u201cunauthorized workers\u201d who were then targeted in the raid.",
      "Of the dozens of workers detained during the raid, \u201cat least two\u201d had prior criminal records, according to the agency.",
      "\u201cThese enforcement operations aim to disrupt illegal employment networks that threaten the integrity of our labor systems, put American jobs at risk and create pathways for exploitation within critical sectors of our economy,\u201d said Steven Stavinoha, U.S. Customs and Border Protection director of field operations in New Orleans, in a written statement.",
      "\u201cOur Company complies fully with federal labor laws, and to our knowledge, no Delta Downs team members were involved in this matter,\u201d said David Strow, a spokesperson for Boyd Gaming Corporation which owns the racetrack, in an emailed statement. \u201cWe will cooperate with law enforcement as requested.\u201d",
      "In the past few weeks, ICE has engaged in other large-scale raids across Louisiana. On May 27, the agency raided a federally funded flood-reduction project in New Orleans and reported arresting 15 Central American workers. And the agency said it arrested 10 Chinese nationals working at massage parlors in Baton Rouge during a June 11 raid.",
      "Rachel Taber, an organizer with the Louisiana-based immigrant rights group Uni\u00f3n Migrante, criticized the raids.",
      "\u201cOur economy runs on immigrants,\u201d Taber said. \u201cAnd when we let ourselves be divided by racial hatred, our economy for everyone suffers.\u201d",

      "The mysterious deliveries have authorities worried that they could be intended to send a menacing message, according to congressional sources and others familiar with the matter.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans in the House have received the unsolicited pizza deliveries, according to House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s office. Pizzas also were sent to current and former leadership of the U.S. Capitol Police, sources said.",
      "\"These recent pizza deliveries are troubling and yet again, bring to light the heightened threat landscape we are living in,\" the Capitol Police said in a statement to ABC News. \"Violence and threats, of any kind, targeted at elected officials will not be tolerated.\u201d",
      "The Capitol Police said they are \"working with our federal, state, and local partners to address the matter.\"",
      "Though many of the pizza deliveries arrived this past weekend, as Minnesota authorities were racing to find the man who allegedly shot two state Democratic lawmakers, the deliveries began before the Minnesota attack, a congressional source said.",
      "The Minnesota shooting spree left one of the lawmakers and her husband dead. The alleged gunman, Vance Luther Boelter, was captured on Sunday, and federal authorities said he named even more potential targets in writings they say they found, including more than 45 federal and state Democrats from Minnesota.",
      "\"It's only the most recent example of violent political extremism in this country, and that's a trend that's been increasing in recent years,\" the acting U.S. attorney in Minnesota, Joe Thompson, said Monday in announcing federal charges against Boelter.",
      "As described to ABC News by the congressional source, the recent pizza deliveries are just another potential source of worry.",
      "\"People are really scared,\" the congressional source said.",
      "Concerns about the pizza deliveries were raised on calls Tuesday with congressional officials and House Sergeant at Arms William McFarland, a congressional source said.",
      "The U.S. Capitol Police declined to provide ABC News with more details about the deliveries, citing an effort to \"protect ongoing investigations and to minimize the risk of copycats.\"",
      "On Monday, ahead of another briefing to discuss security measures for lawmakers, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., released a video praising the U.S. Capitol Police and the Senate sergeant at arms for \u201cbending over backwards during very trying times and \u2026 doing an excellent job.\u201d",
      "Law enforcement officials told ABC News that many public officials have been anonymously sent pizzas in recent years and that the deliveries are thought to be intended to send a potentially threatening message: letting recipients know that the sender knows where they live.",
      "Federal Judge Esther Salas, whose son, Daniel Anderl, was murdered at her home in 2020 by a man posing as a delivery driver, recently told ABC News Prime's Linsey Davis that \u201chundreds of pizzas are being delivered to the personal homes of judges throughout the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had heard about pizzas being delivered to judges\u2019 houses, and that says what? \u2018I know where you live,\u2019\u201d Salas said, adding that recent pizza deliveries were sent to the homes of other judges, and used the name of her murdered son as the sender.",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",
      "\u201cI still like Barcelona,\" she said. \"I have met a lot of people who were kind.\u201d",

      "A growing number of Spaniards are souring on the country's highly successful tourism industry which is being blamed for a stubborn housing crisis",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- In Barcelona's residential Gr\u00e0cia neighborhood known for its quaint squares, Txema Escorsa feels he is being left behind.",
      "The friendly faces of neighbors in his apartment building have been replaced by a non-stop flow of hard-partying foreigners, and his teacher's salary can't keep pace with the rising rent.",
      "\"It is tough for me to imagine what to do next,\u201d he told The Associated Press in the living room of his two-bedroom apartment. \u201cIf I leave, will I be contributing to Barcelona losing its essence that comes from its locals? But there comes a time when I'm fed up.\u201d",
      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",
      "Similar demonstrations are slated in several other Spanish cities, including on the Balearic islands of Mallorca and Ibiza, as well as in the Italian postcard city of Venice, Portugal's capital Lisbon and other cities across southern Europe \u2014 marking the first time a protest against tourism has been coordinated across the region.",
      "A poll in June 2022 found just 2% of Spaniards thought housing was a national problem. Three years later, almost a third of those surveyed said it is now a leading concern. (Both polls were of 4,000 people, with a margin of error of 1.6%)",
      "Spaniards have staged several large protests in Barcelona, Madrid and other cities in recent years to demand lower rents. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Last year, Barcelona seemed to reach a tipping point when a rally in favor of \u201cdegrowing tourism\u201d ended with some protestors shooting water pistols at unsuspecting tourists. Images of those incidents went around the world, and more such scenes are expected on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt is very likely the water pistols will be back,\" said Daniel Pardo, one of the organizers of the Barcelona protest. \"In fact, we encourage people to bring their own.\u201d",
      "Spain, with a population of 48 million, hosted a record 94 million international visitors in 2024, compared with 83 million in 2019, making it one of the most-visited countries in the world. It could receive as many as 100 million tourists this year, according to studies cited by Spain's economy minister.",
      "Spain's municipal and federal authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry and are taking appropriate action to put the tourism industry on notice, despite the fact it contributes 12% of national GDP.",
      "Almost two-thirds of those who took part in a poll conducted last year in Barcelona said tourist apartments led to bothersome behavior. Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",
      "Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate AP interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "\u201cThese record numbers in terms of tourism also pose challenges, and we need to deal with those challenges also for our own population,\u201d Cuerpo said.",
      "The short-term rental industry believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago told the AP. \u201cIf you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s.\"",
      "He says hotels are still the leading accommodation for tourists. In Barcelona, hotels accounted for 20 million tourists in 2024, compared with 12 million who used homes, according to local data.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago notes the contradiction of Barcelona\u2019s Mayor Jaume Collboni backing the expansion of the city's international airport \u2014 announced this week \u2014 while still planning to wipe out the tourist apartments.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Escorsa, the teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city; he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",

      "Here are five things the U.N. does that you may not have known:",
      "U.N. agencies facilitate programs worldwide focused on women, tied to education, financial literacy, employment opportunities and more. Among the most sensitive services provided are those for victims of gender-based violence.",
      "In Chad, the U.N. Population Fund operates several rehabilitation programs for women and girls recovering from that trauma. One of them, Halima Yakoy Adam, was taken at age 15 to a Boko Haram training camp in Nigeria, where she and several other girls were forced to become suicide bombers. Adam managed to escape with severe injuries, while the others died in blasts.",
      "Through U.N. programs on the islands of Lake Chad, Adam received health and reproductive services as well as vocational training. She is now working as a paralegal in her community to assist other women and girls.",
      "\u201cWe are not created to stay,\u201d Keita said of U.N. agencies' long-term presence. \u201cSo this is embedded in what we do every single day. We have that humility in knowing that we make a difference, so that people do not need us the next day.\u201d",
      "Images of refugees at U.S. and European borders show the migration crisis around the world. Often overlooked are the refugees who are resettled in communities outside American and European cities, ones that resemble their home countries and cultural upbringings.",
      "Since 2016, the U.N.'s refugee agency has supported the integration of more than 50,000 refugees and asylum-seekers in Mexico. They arrived in southern Mexico and were relocated to industrial cities after being screened and granted asylum by the government.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees provides transportation, orientation and access to health, education and other social services. More than 650 companies have agreed to train and employ these people, whose labor has generated a $15 million annual contribution to the Mexican economy, according to the U.N.",
      "According to U.N. estimates, 94% of these working-age refugees have secured formal employment within their first month in the country and nearly 90% of school-age children have enrolled in school. The U.N. program also provides what staffers describe as clear pathways to Mexican citizenship.",
      "\u201cMexico has become a country where people forced to flee can find the stability they need to restart their lives with dignity,\u201d Giovanni Lepri, the top U.N. refugee agency official in Mexico, said in March. \u201cA strong asylum system and legal framework allows an effective integration of asylum-seekers and refugees.\u201d",
      "U.N. agencies are present throughout various phases of war, from delivering food, water and medical supplies in an active military zone to the iconic \u201cBlue Helmets\u201d \u2014 the military personnel deployed to help countries transition out of conflict.",
      "Less attention is paid to efforts made after the dust has settled.",
      "One of those initiatives, the United Nations Mine Action Service, was established in 1997 to facilitate projects aimed at mitigating the threat posed by unexploded munitions in countries years \u2014 and sometimes decades \u2014 after war.",
      "The U.N. estimates that on average, one person is killed or injured by land mines and other explosive ordnance every hour.",
      "In January, a 21-year-old man was harvesting olives in a Syrian orchard with two friends when they noticed a visible mine on the ground. Panicked, they tried to leave, but one of them stepped on a land mine and it exploded, amputating one of his legs above the knee.",
      "A month later, in Cambodia, a rocket-propelled grenade believed to be more than 25 years old killed two toddlers when it blew up near their homes.",
      "The U.N. program aims to work with communities in Syria, Afghanistan and Nigeria to safely locate and remove these remnants of war while providing education and threat assessments.",
      "Since its inception, the U.N. says more than 55 million land mines have been destroyed and over 30 countries have become mine-free.",
      "In a refugee camp in northwest Kenya, dozens of girls 12 to 18 have gathered every Saturday at a women's empowerment center to learn self-defense through a Taekwondo class.",
      "The program, launched by the U.N.'s Population Fund last year, has focused on providing an outlet for girls who have either been victims of gender-based violence or are at risk of it after fleeing conflict zones in countries like South Sudan, Ethiopia and Congo.",
      "The coaches are locals who understand the cultural and political dynamics their students face while living in a camp that is home to nearly 300,000 refugees.",
      "The goal is to use sports activities to create safe spaces for women and girls to discuss various issues like period poverty, abuse and domestic conflict. The program, which the U.N. has replicated in Egypt and elsewhere, is funded by the Olympic Refuge Foundation.",
      "Topics surrounding sex and reproductive issues were considered taboo for centuries in Buddhist communities. U.N. staffers have spent the past decade working with religious leaders in Bhutan and other countries in Asia to \u201cdesensitize\u201d the topics they believe are crucial to a healthy society.",
      "The campaign has led more than 1,500 nuns from 26 nunneries to hold discussions with community members around sexual and reproductive health and the prevention of gender-based violence.",
      "Now, at least 50 monks are trained to provide counseling services on these topics to students across Bhutan's 20 districts.",
      "The U.N. says these partnerships, which began in 2014, have contributed to a decrease in maternal mortality, an increase in contraception use, and better reproductive care for pregnant women.",

      "Though the Trump administration has been removing content on African American history from federal websites, Juneteenth remains a federal holiday, commemorating June 19, 1865",
      "PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- By the time the drumming and dancing starts Thursday, an organization that promotes African American history and culture in New Hampshire will have hosted nearly a dozen events to celebrate Juneteenth.",
      "The Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire\u2019s weekslong celebration will culminate with the rededication of the African Burying Ground Memorial Park in Portsmouth and a community dance. But those who planned the history tours, community discussions and other events to commemorate June 19, 1865 \u2014 the day Union solders brought the news of freedom to enslaved Black people in Texas \u2014 also were looking ahead to next year\u2019s 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Executive Director JerriAnne Boggis said her organization and other partners want to highlight contradictions in the familiar narratives about the nation\u2019s founding fathers.",
      "\u201cAlthough they are historically courageous, smart men, they were also human. They held people in bondage. They had children with their enslaved,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat would the story look like if the story of America was told from these Black descendants?\u201d",
      "Juneteenth has been celebrated by Black Americans for generations, but became more widely celebrated after former President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday in 2021. It is recognized at least as an observance in every state, and nearly 30 states and Washington, D.C., have designated it as a permanent paid or legal holiday through legislation or executive action. But this year\u2019s celebrations come as President Donald Trump has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government and removed content about Black American history from federal websites.",
      "The White House said last week that plans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided. During his first administration, Trump issued statements each June 19, including one that ended with \u201cOn Juneteenth 2017, we honor the countless contributions made by African Americans to our Nation and pledge to support America\u2019s promise as the land of the free.\u201d",
      "The bitter national debates about Trump's travel ban and DEI initiatives haven't overshadowed celebrations of the end of slavery in the U.S., however, and events are happening around the country Thursday.",
      "New Hampshire, one of the nation's whitest states, is not among those with a permanent Juneteenth holiday, and Boggis said her hope that lawmakers would take action is waning.",
      "\u201cI am not so sure anymore given the political environment we\u2019re in,\" she said. \u201cI think we\u2019ve taken a whole bunch of steps backwards in understanding our history, civil rights and inclusion.\u201d",
      "Still, she hopes New Hampshire's events and others elsewhere will make a difference.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a divisive tool to know the truth. Knowing the truth helps us understand some of the current issues that we\u2019re going through,\u201d she said.",
      "And if spreading that truth comes with a bit of fun, all the better, she said.",
      "\u201cWhen we come together, when we break bread together, we enjoy music together, we learn together, we dance together, we\u2019re creating these bonds of community,\u201d she said. \u201cAs much was we educate, we also want to celebrate together.\u201d",

      "A groundbreaking is scheduled in Virginia for the rebuilding of one of the nation\u2019s oldest Black churches",
      "WILLIAMSBURG, Va. -- A ceremonial groundbreaking will be held Thursday for the rebuilding of one of the nation's oldest Black churches, whose congregants first gathered outdoors in secret before constructing a wooden meetinghouse in Virginia.",
      "The First Baptist Church of Williamsburg officially established itself in 1776, although parishioners met before then in fields and under trees in defiance of laws that prevented African Americans from congregating. Free and enslaved members erected the original church house around 1805, laying the foundation with recycled bricks.",
      "Reconstructing the 16-foot by 32-foot (5-meter by 10-meter) building will help demonstrate that \u201cBlack history is American history,\u201d First Baptist Pastor Reginald F. Davis told The Associated Press before the Juneteenth groundbreaking.",
      "\u201cOral history is one thing but to have an image to go along with the oral history makes a greater impact on the psyche of oppressed people,\" said Davis, who leads the current 215-member congregation in a 20th Century church that is less than a mile from the original site. \"Black Americans have been part of this nation\u2019s history before and since the Declaration of Independence.\u201d",
      "The original building was destroyed by a tornado in 1834. First Baptist\u2019s second structure, built in 1856, stood there for a century. But the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, a living history museum, bought the property in 1956 and turned the space into a parking lot.",
      "Colonial Williamsburg had covered the costs of building First Baptist's current church house. But for decades it failed to tell the church's pioneering history and the stories of other colonial Black Americans.",
      "In recent years, the museum has placed a growing emphasis on telling a more complete story about the nation's founding. Colonial Williamsburg's rebuilding of the church is an opportunity to tell Black history and resurrect the stories of those who originally built it.",
      "Rebuilding First Baptist's original meetinghouse will fill an important historical gap, while bolstering the museum's depiction of Virginia\u2019s 18th century capital through interpreters and restored buildings. More than half of the 2,000 people who lived in Williamsburg at the time were Black, many of them enslaved.",
      "Rev. James Ingram is an interpreter who has for 27 years portrayed Gowan Pamphlet, First Baptists\u2019 pastor when the original church structure was built. Pamphlet was an enslaved tavern worker who followed his calling to preach, sermonizing equality, despite the laws that prohibited large gatherings of African Americans out of fear of slave uprisings.",
      "\u201cHe is a precursor to someone like Frederick Douglass, who would be the precursor to someone like Martin Luther King Jr.,\u201d Ingram said. \u201cGowan Pamphlet was leading the charge.\u201d",
      "The museum's archaeologists uncovered the original church's foundation in 2021, prompting Pastor Davis to say then that it was \u201ca rediscovery of the humanity of a people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis helps to erase the historical and social amnesia that has afflicted this country for so many years,\u201d he said.",
      "The archaeologists also located 62 graves, while experts examined three sets of remains and linked them to the congregation.",
      "Scientists at William & Mary\u2019s Institute for Historical Biology said the teeth of a Black male in his teens indicated some kind of stress, such as malnutrition or disease.",
      "\u201cIt either represents the conditions of an enslaved childhood or far less likely \u2014 but possibly \u2014 conditions for a free African American in childhood,\u201d Michael Blakey, the institute\u2019s director, said in 2023.",
      "In the early 1800s, the congregation acquired the property for the original church from a local white merchant. The land was low, soft and often soggy \u2014 hardly ideal for building, said Jack Gary, Colonial Williamsburg\u2019s executive director of archaeology.",
      "But the church's congregants, many of whom were skilled tradespeople, made it work by flipping bricks on their side and making other adjustments to lay a level foundation.",
      "\u201cIt was a marvel that they were able to build a structure there, but also that the structure persists and even grows bigger,\u201d Gary said, adding that the church was later expanded.",
      "Based on their excavation, archaeologists surmise there was no heat source, such as a fireplace, no glass in the windows and no plaster finish, Gary said.",
      "About 50 people could have sat comfortably inside, possibly 100 if they were standing. The congregation numbered about 500, which included people on surrounding plantations. Services likely occurred outside the church as well.",
      "White planters and business owners were often aware of the large gatherings, which technically were banned, while there's documentary evidence of some people getting caught, Gary said.",
      "Following Nat Turner's rebellion in 1831, which killed more than 50 white people in Virginia's Southampton County, the congregation was led by white pastors, though it was Black preachers doing the work, Gary said. The tornado destroyed the structure a few years later.",
      "The museum is rebuilding the 1805 meetinghouse at its original site and will use common wood species from the time: pine, poplar and oak, said Matthew Webster, the museum's executive director of architectural preservation and research. The boards are already being cut. Construction is expected to finish next year.",
      "The windows will have shutters but no glass, Webster said, while a concrete beam will support the new church directly over its original foundation, preserving the bricks.",
      "\u201cWhen we build the earliest part of the church, we will put bricks on their sides and will lay them in that strange way because that tells the story of those individuals struggling to quickly get their church up,\u201d Webster said. \u201cAnd then when we build the addition, it will be this formal foundation that really shows the establishment of the church.\u201d",
      "Janice Canaday, who traces her lineage to First Baptist, said Williamsburg's Black community never forgot its original location or that its graves were paved over in the 1950s.",
      "\u201cThey will never be able to expunge us from the landscape,\u201d said Canaday, who is also the museum's African American community engagement manager. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you take out the building. It doesn\u2019t matter if you ban books. You will never be able to pull that root up because that root is so deep.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Karen Read has walked out of a Massachusetts court a free woman after a jury found her not guilty of killing her Boston police officer boyfriend",
      "DEDHAM, Mass. -- Karen Read walked out of court a free woman after more than three years and two trials over the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, who was found on the lawn of a fellow officer's home after a night of heavy drinking.",
      "Prosecutors said Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV, leaving him to die in a blizzard, and charged her with second-degree murder, manslaughter and leaving the scene of a deadly collision.",
      "Her lawyers successfully defended her, painting a sinister picture of police misconduct and theorizing that O'Keefe was in fact killed by colleagues, followed by a vast cover-up. She was convicted of drunken driving, however, for which she will face a year's probation.",
      "Though her criminal case is over, Read still faces civil litigation. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s family has filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against her and two bars where the couple drank that night.",
      "The two trials were filled with moments that raised reasonable doubt, both in the public's mind and, as illustrated by Wednesday's verdict, the minds of jurors.",
      "Here are some key takeaways:",
      "Defense lawyers asserted from the beginning that there was no collision between O'Keefe and the 6,000-pound (2,700-kilogram) SUV driven by Read, arguing instead that a crew of tightly knit local and state cops were shielding one of their own and framing her.",
      "Lead investigator Michael Proctor, who was fired from the Massachusetts State Police after the first trial for misconduct, knew some people at the party at the house outside of which O'Keefe was found.",
      "Proctor sent text messages to friends, family and co-workers calling Read a \u201cwhack job\u201d while implying that she was the lone suspect and he wanted her to pay. \u201cThere will be some serious charges brought on the girl ... Zero chance she skates. She\u2019s f\u2019d,\u201d he texted just hours into the investigation.",
      "A federal agent who was at the party, Brian Higgins, acknowledged at trial destroying his phone and SIM card afterward and disposing of them in two different locations on a military base.",
      "In another exchange, Jackson questioned a former officer who originally reported seeing Higgins and the Canton police chief near the SUV in a station garage, a statement she later recanted.",
      "\u201cHave you ever heard of something called the blue wall of silence?\u201d Jackson asked the officer. In closing arguments, he suggested that she changed her story under pressure from the department.",
      "The prosecution's evidence included pieces of Read's broken taillight that were recovered at the scene; accounts of the couple's crumbling relationship, fueled by booze; and several witnesses testifying that they heard her repeatedly say, \u201cI hit him.\u201d",
      "But defense lawyers portrayed the case as riddled with errors, missteps and malfeasance.",
      "They emphasized that the taillight fragments were not found immediately and argued that police had time to take them from Read\u2019s impounded vehicle and plant them. They also presented video evidence that Read\u2019s taillight could have been damaged instead when she hit O\u2019Keefe\u2019s car at home later that morning.",
      "The shards, which the state claimed cut into O\u2019Keefe\u2019s arm, had no blood, tissue or DNA on them. The only DNA found was on an intact piece of taillight on Read\u2019s SUV, and it contained three possible sources \u2014 O\u2019Keefe and two unknown males. A hair traced to O'Keefe was found on the rear of the SUV, but the defense questioned how it could have stayed there through the blizzard.",
      "Prosecutors also struggled to demonstrate that O'Keefe's injuries were consistent with being struck by a vehicle. They acknowledged not knowing how he was hit, and an accident reconstruction video they produced was panned by the defense since no one knows where he would have been standing.",
      "Meanwhile crash reconstruction experts testified for the defense that O\u2019Keefe\u2019s injuries were inconsistent with being hit by a large vehicle. Instead, the defense argued, O'Keefe was beaten up at the party.",
      "Neither side produced witnesses who saw him enter into the house, but the defense was able to show a fight was possible. A medical expert testified that wounds on his arm were consistent with an animal bite, supporting the theory that a family dog at the home attacked O'Keefe.",
      "A cut over his right eye and injuries to the back of his head, they said, more likely came from being punched and falling backward on a hard surface. It was hard to know, defense attorneys argued, since police never searched the home or treated anyone there as a suspect.",
      "Even Read's comments about having \u201chit him\u201d were explained away by the defense, which said prosecutors were trying to twist into a confession the dazed words of someone who was grieving and in shock.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a confession. It was confusion,\u201d Jackson said, noting that it is common to be in such a state after an emotional trauma.",
      "Any number of people at the home, defense lawyers suggested, while questioning why multiple key law enforcement witnesses were never considered potential suspects or investigated.",
      "The defense did not prove that someone else killed O'Keefe, but it was apparently able to create enough reasonable doubt for jurors.",
      "Higgins, the federal agent, had sent sexually charged and flirtatious text messages to Read despite knowing she was in a relationship with O\u2019Keefe. On the night in question, Higgins texted her while they were at a bar \u2014 \u201cUmm, well?\u201d he wrote. Moments later he was seen \u201cplay fighting\u201d with Brian Albert, a retired Boston police detective and the owner of the home where the party took place.",
      "They defense also pointed to a group text that morning in which one person suggested they all agree that O'Keefe never entered the home and Albert said, \u201cexactly.\u201d Albert, the defense said, never bothered to exit the house after O'Keefe was found. He later sold it, got rid of the family dog and ditched his cellphone.",
      "They also portrayed the family as politically connected, noting that Albert's brother was a police officer and a second brother was on the town's governing body.",
      "The defense also questioned Jennifer McCabe, Albert\u2019s sister-in-law, who was with Read when they discovered the body, about a misspelled web search: \u201chos long to die in cold.\u201d The defense argued that McCabe made it just before 2:30 a.m., but prosecutors said it was after O\u2019Keefe was found at Read's request.",
      "McCabe was also asked why she never went in the house after finding the body, suggesting that she already knew they were safe inside. No one from the home came outside as police and paramedics gathered.",

      "MIAMI -- A drug informant who helped the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration build some of its biggest cases has been arrested and charged with scheming to extort major cocaine traffickers facing extradition from Colombia and the Dominican Republic.",
      "Jorge Hern\u00e1ndez, 57, was charged in a criminal complaint unsealed Wednesday with one count of conspiring to commit wire fraud. He remains in custody after being arrested and making his initial court appearance Wednesday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale.",
      "Court papers allege that Hern\u00e1ndez operated a scheme starting in 2020 in which he pretended to be a paralegal who, for the right price, could obtain lighter sentences for drug kingpins, according to 17-page FBI affidavit.",
      "The FBI alleged that Hern\u00e1ndez demanded payments of $1 million from six suspected drug traffickers who ended up surrendering or being extradited to the U.S.",
      "In exchange for the payments \u2014 which came in the form of cash, jewelry, properties and vehicles in Colombia \u2014 Hern\u00e1ndez guaranteed short prison sentences that would be served \u201cin an apartment similar to being on house arrest,\u201d the court papers said.",
      "But Hern\u00e1ndez never delivered on his promises, nor did he have authority to offer such leniency. As the traffickers who thought they were buying influence grew upset, he would deny responsibility and shift blame to the traffickers\u2019 attorneys, the FBI said.",
      "Nestor Menendez, an attorney who represented Hern\u00e1ndez at his initial appearance, declined to comment.",
      "In two decades as a confidential informant, Hern\u00e1ndez had been one of federal law enforcement's most prolific case-makers, providing the types of tips and information that led to prosecutions of high seas drug smugglers, a former University of Miami money laundering expert and a close ally of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Better known in law enforcement circles by his Spanish nickname Boliche \u2014 bowling ball \u2014 the beefy, bald-headed Colombian was also the star witness in the 2023 bribery trial of two former DEA supervisors convicted for leaking information on ongoing drug investigations.",
      "He got his start as an informant in 2000 shortly after he was arrested in Venezuela, where he had fled to escape drug dealers seeking to kill him, according to a 2023 investigation by The Associated Press.",
      "After bribing officials to secure his release, he approached the DEA, admitting to killing three people during his days as a drug runner near his home along Colombia's Caribbean coast. He then began helping the DEA build some of its biggest cases.",
      "Agents grew so reliant on Hern\u00e1ndez\u2019s network of criminal associates across the Western hemisphere that they set him up with a phone and desk at a federal anti-narcotics task force, the AP found.",
      "The DEA terminated his cooperation agreement in 2008, court records show, after authorities discovered he had threatened to expose informants as snitches unless they paid him to keep quiet.",
      "But he kept close to some of his former DEA handlers and eventually returned to Miami. In 2016, he met DEA agent John Costanzo, who was supervising agents investigating Colombian businessman Alex Saab, a suspected bag man for Venezuela\u2019s Maduro. In 2023, Hern\u00e1ndez testified against Costanzo and another former DEA agent convicted of taking bribes from narco defense attorneys.",
      "Hern\u00e1ndez turned the tables on the DEA around the same time he was charged alongside University of Miami professor Bruce Bagley for helping move $3 million on behalf of Saab, who prosecutors said was secretly negotiating a deal to betray Maduro.",
      "Those charges remain under seal. In the complaint unsealed Wednesday, the FBI that Hern\u00e1ndez is serving a term of probation on a federal conviction for conspiracy to commit money laundering that is set to end in May 2027.",

      "Hundreds have gathered outside Minnesota\u2019s Capitol for a vigil to remember a prominent state lawmaker and her husband gunned down at their home",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Hundreds of people, some clutching candles or carrying flowers to lay in front of a memorial, gathered outside Minnesota\u2019s Capitol on Wednesday evening for a vigil to remember a prominent state lawmaker and her husband who were gunned down at their home.",
      "As a brass quintet from the Minnesota Orchestra played, Gov. Tim Walz wiped away tears and comforted attendees at the gathering for former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, who were killed early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs.",
      "Colin Hortman, the Hortmans\u2019 son, embraced Walz and lay a photo of his parents on the memorial.",
      "The memorial, which sprang up outside the Capitol after the killings, features flowers, American flags, photos and sticky notes with such messages as, \u201cThank you for always believing in me and in Minnesota\u201d and \u201cWe got this from here. Thank you for everything.\u201d",
      "Wednesday's vigil also included a Native American drum circle, a string quartet and the crowd singing \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d",
      "Around the gathering, there was a heavy police presence, with law enforcement blocking off streets leading up to the Capitol and state troopers standing guard.",
      "The event didn't include a speaking program and attendees were instructed not to bring signs of any kind.",
      "The man charged in federal and state court with killing the Hortmans, Vance Boelter, is also accused of shooting another Democratic lawmaker, Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home a few miles away in Champlin. They survived and are recovering. Federal prosecutors have declined to speculate about a motive.",
      "Boelter\u2019s attorneys have declined to comment on the charges.",
      "Hortman had served as the top House Democratic leader since 2017, and six years as speaker, starting in 2019. Under a power-sharing deal after the 2024 election left the House tied, her title became speaker emerita and Republican Rep. Lisa Demuth became speaker.",
      "Walz has described Hortman as his closest political ally and \u201cthe most consequential Speaker in state history.\u201d",
      "The Hortmans were alumni of the University of Minnesota, which held a midday memorial gathering on the Minneapolis campus.",
      "Rebecca Cunningham, the university's president, spoke during the event about the grief and outrage people are grappling with along with questions about how things got to this point.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have the answers to these questions but I know that finding answers starts with the coming together in community as we are today,\u201d she said.",

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Two men were sentenced Wednesday to lifelong terms in prison in the shooting death of an 11-year-old boy outside an Albuquerque baseball stadium in 2023 that prompted the New Mexico governor to issue a controversial gun ban, the district attorney's office in Albuquerque said.",
      "Investigators say a truck carrying a mother and three young children was mistaken for another vehicle in the shooting as vehicles were leaving the stadium. Gunfire killed 11-year-old Froylan Villegas and paralyzed cousin Tatiana Villegas, while Foylan\u2019s mother and baby brother were unharmed.",
      "A jury in February convicted Jose Romero and Nathen Garley, both in their early 20s, of first-degree murder, tampering with evidence, shooting at or from a vehicle and other charges in the death of Villegas.",
      "The men were sentenced to life in prison plus 46 years, ensuring they will stay under Corrections Department custody permanently, prosecutors said.",
      "In the aftermath of the shooting and others that killed children, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham declared a public health emergency over gun violence, temporarily suspending the right to carry guns in some parks and playgrounds in the greater Albuquerque area. The decision touched off protests and legal challenges by advocates for gun rights.",
      "District Attorney Sam Bregman, a Democratic candidate for governor in 2026, said in a statement that the shootings \u201cshook our entire community\" and praised his staff for pursuing accountability.",

      "A team of 60 international scientists report that by early 2028 society will have emitted enough greenhouse gases that the Earth will be pretty much locked into hitting the internationally agreed upon preferred limit for global warming",
      "WASHINGTON -- Humans are on track to release so much greenhouse gas in less than three years that a key threshold for limiting global warming will be nearly unavoidable, according to a study to be released Thursday.",
      "The report predicts that society will have emitted enough carbon dioxide by early 2028 that crossing an important long-term temperature boundary will be more likely than not. The scientists calculate that by that point there will be enough of the heat-trapping gas in the atmosphere to create a 50-50 chance or greater that the world will be locked in to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times. That level of gas accumulation, which comes from the burning of fuels like gasoline, oil and coal, is sooner than the same group of 60 international scientists calculated in a study last year.",
      "\u201cThings aren\u2019t just getting worse. They\u2019re getting worse faster,\u201d said study co-author Zeke Hausfather of the tech firm Stripe and the climate monitoring group Berkeley Earth. \u201cWe\u2019re actively moving in the wrong direction in a critical period of time that we would need to meet our most ambitious climate goals. Some reports, there\u2019s a silver lining. I don\u2019t think there really is one in this one.\u201d",
      "That 1.5 goal, first set in the 2015 Paris agreement, has been a cornerstone of international efforts to curb worsening climate change. Scientists say crossing that limit would mean worse heat waves and droughts, bigger storms and sea-level rise that could imperil small island nations. Over the last 150 years, scientists have established a direct correlation between the release of certain levels of carbon dioxide, along with other greenhouse gases like methane, and specific increases in global temperatures.",
      "In Thursday's Indicators of Global Climate Change report, researchers calculated that society can spew only 143 billion more tons (130 billion metric tons) of carbon dioxide before the 1.5 limit becomes technically inevitable. The world is producing 46 billion tons (42 billion metric tons) a year, so that inevitability should hit around February 2028 because the report is measured from the start of this year, the scientists wrote. The world now stands at about 1.24 degrees Celsius (2.23 degrees Fahrenheit) of long-term warming since preindustrial times, the report said.",
      "The report, which was published in the journal Earth System Science Data, shows that the rate of human-caused warming per decade has increased to nearly half a degree (0.27 degrees Celsius) per decade, Hausfather said. And the imbalance between the heat Earth absorbs from the sun and the amount it radiates out to space, a key climate change signal, is accelerating, the report said.",
      "\u201cIt's quite a depressing picture unfortunately, where if you look across the indicators, we find that records are really being broken everywhere,\u201d said lead author Piers Forster, director of the Priestley Centre for Climate Futures at the University of Leeds in England. \u201cI can't conceive of a situation where we can really avoid passing 1.5 degrees of very long-term temperature change.\u201d",
      "The increase in emissions from fossil-fuel burning is the main driver. But reduced particle pollution, which includes soot and smog, is another factor because those particles had a cooling effect that masked even more warming from appearing, scientists said. Changes in clouds also factor in. That all shows up in Earth\u2019s energy imbalance, which is now 25% higher than it was just a decade or so ago, Forster said.",
      "Earth\u2019s energy imbalance \u201cis the most important measure of the amount of heat being trapped in the system,\u201d Hausfather said.",
      "Earth keeps absorbing more and more heat than it releases. \u201cIt is very clearly accelerating. It\u2019s worrisome,\u201d he said.",
      "The planet temporarily passed the key 1.5 limit last year. The world hit 1.52 degrees Celsius (2.74 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since preindustrial times for an entire year in 2024, but the Paris threshold is meant to be measured over a longer period, usually considered 20 years. Still, the globe could reach that long-term threshold in the next few years even if individual years haven't consistently hit that mark, because of how the Earth's carbon cycle works.",
      "That 1.5 is \u201ca clear limit, a political limit for which countries have decided that beyond which the impact of climate change would be unacceptable to their societies,\u201d said study co-author Joeri Rogelj, a climate scientist at Imperial College London.",
      "The mark is so important because once it is crossed, many small island nations could eventually disappear because of sea level rise, and scientific evidence shows that the impacts become particularly extreme beyond that level, especially hurting poor and vulnerable populations, he said. He added that efforts to curb emissions and the impacts of climate change must continue even if the 1.5 degree threshold is exceeded.",
      "Crossing the threshold \"means increasingly more frequent and severe climate extremes of the type we are now seeing all too often in the U.S. and around the world \u2014 unprecedented heat waves, extreme hot drought, extreme rainfall events, and bigger storms,\u201d said University of Michigan environment school dean Jonathan Overpeck, who wasn't part of the study.",
      "Andrew Dessler, a Texas A&M University climate scientist who wasn't part of the study, said the 1.5 goal was aspirational and not realistic, so people shouldn\u2019t focus on that particular threshold.",
      "\u201cMissing it does not mean the end of the world,\u201d Dessler said in an email, though he agreed that \u201ceach tenth of a degree of warming will bring increasingly worse impacts.\u201d",

      "ATLANTA -- A former Fulton County jail guard has been indicted on federal civil rights charges after prosecutors said she used her Taser abusively against three inmates and then lied to cover it up.",
      "Khadijah Solomon, a 47-year-old Fairburn resident, pleaded not guilty to the six-count indictment in federal court in Atlanta on Tuesday and was released on bail. The troubled jail where Solomon worked has been under a federal civil rights investigation for the past two years and was also the site where Donald Trump surrendered on election interference charges in 2023.",
      "Solomon's lawyer, Devin Rafus, said his client will fight the allegations.",
      "\u201cThe Fulton County Sheriff\u2019s Office is under a lot of political pressure with the Department of Justice investigating the jail,\u201d Rafus said via email. \u201cMy client is collateral damage of that pressure.\u201d",
      "The June 11 indictment said Solomon used her Taser \u201cwithout legal justification\" against separate inmates at the Atlanta jail on Jan. 16, Jan. 25 and Jan. 27. The indictment alleges that Solomon then wrote reports falsely justifying what she did.",
      "In reality, sheriff's office investigators said body-worn camera video showed the pretrial detainees were compliant and not resisting.",
      "In the Jan. 16 incident, sheriff's office investigators said Solomon approached an inmate who was kicking his cell door and said she was about to \u201cpop\u201d him before opening the cell and using the Taser on the inmate. Investigators said Solomon then stunned the inmate twice more. She later claimed in her report that the inmate \u201cwas getting ready to throw\u201d a tray at her.",
      "The sheriff's office in February announced that it had fired Solomon and two other jail officers \u2014 Chantrece Buggs and LaQuondria Pierce \u2014 arrested them, and charged them with state crimes including aggravated assault and violating their oath of office. Solomon, a jail sergeant, was also charged with cruelty to inmates and false statements or writings.",
      "At the time, investigators said Pierce used her Taser without justification on an inmate Feb. 13 and Buggs encouraged Solomon's violence. No federal charges against the other two were announced, and neither has yet been indicted in a state court.",
      "Rafus, who is also the lawyer representing Pierce, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment on her state charges.",
      "Natalie Ammons, a spokesperson for Fulton County Sheriff Pat Labat, said the sheriff's office had worked with the FBI in the Solomon case.",
      "\u201cOn three occasions, Khadijah Solomon allegedly tased Fulton County Jail detainees without a legitimate purpose, causing each of them pain and injury,\" U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg said in a statement. \"Abuses of power of this kind are unconstitutional, erode our community\u2019s trust, and will be prosecuted.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Justice Department in July 2023 opened a civil rights investigation into jail conditions in Fulton County, citing violence, filthy living quarters and the in-custody death of a man whose body was found covered in insects. That investigation found that jail officers didn't receive adequate training and guidance on the use of force and were found to engage in \u201ca pattern or practice of using excessive force\u201d against people in county custody.",
      "The Justice Department and Fulton County officials announced in January that they had entered into a court-enforceable consent decree. An independent monitor was appointed in February to oversee that agreement.",

      "A retired Connecticut police detective who went missing last year was found seven months later buried under debris in hoarding conditions in her home",
      "GLASTONBURY, Conn. -- Mary Notarangelo lived a reclusive life in her later years, according to the few people who had contact with her. The retired police detective tended to her many birds at her Connecticut home and posted videos of them on social media, including one accompanying her on a trip to a local crafts store.",
      "But a welfare check request to police last year uncovered disturbing truths. Hoarding conditions were found in her house in Glastonbury, just southeast of Hartford, when authorities tried to find her last July. It wasn't until February that a work crew using a small excavator discovered her skeletal remains. They were found beneath a pile of debris heaped just inside her front door, according to a police report released Wednesday.",
      "Glastonbury police said conditions in the single-family home set off a rural road in the woods were among the worst they've seen and hindered several search attempts over the months. Officers said there were 6-foot-tall (2-meter-tall) \u201cmountains\u201d of garbage blocking entrance doors. Dead birds were found in cages along with mice running about and a live cat. And there was a terrible stench.",
      "\u201cOnce inside, I observed more mountains of garbage, cobwebs, and spiders,\u201d Officer Anthony Longo wrote in the report. \u201cThere was no path whatsoever. The only way to move from room to room was by climbing over the garbage.\u201d",
      "It's not clear how Notarangelo died. At 73, she was a retired Bridgeport police detective and longtime Wiccan, according to officials and friends. Her death was first reported by Hearst Connecticut Media earlier Wednesday.",
      "The state medical examiner's office said her cause of death could not be determined because the remains were mostly skeletal. A friend had called police to request the welfare check July 3, 2024. He told investigators Notarangelo last texted him around June 12, 2024, saying she was having abdominal cramps, vomiting and had fallen. It's not clear why the friend \u2014 who did not return phone and text messages \u2014 waited so long to call authorities.",
      "It's also not clear why it took seven months to find her remains, although several attempts had been made and officials cited the mounds of trash and other items. A police spokesperson did not immediately return an email seeking comment about the timeline.",
      "\u201cIt's so upsetting and so sad,\u201d said another friend, Patti Steeves, who worked with Notarangelo at the Bridgeport Police Department as a civilian employee years ago. \u201cShe, as quirky as she was, she was a good person at heart.\u201d",
      "Steeves added: \u201cShe was passionate about her faith. She was passionate about her job. She had a great sense of humor. And she loved her animals. She loved her animals more than she did herself.\u201d",
      "Steeves said she tried to talk with Notarangelo about the hoarding, but Notarangelo wouldn't discuss it.",
      "She said Notarangelo was a \u201cbird fanatic\u201d who had about 20 birds, including cockatoos, cockatiels and parrots, and a cat and a dog.",
      "Bridgeport police said Notarangelo worked there from 1985 to 1996. She was promoted to detective in 1992 and to sergeant a year later. Steeves said she retired on disability after an on-duty car crash that injured her back and legs.",
      "Notarangelo posted occasionally on her social media accounts, saying she was an animal lover and an \u201cintuitive & reiki master,\u201d referring to the Japanese healing practice. She posted videos and photos of her birds, including a cockatoo perched on a shopping cart during her outing to a crafts store.",
      "Police and firefighters first searched the home on July 3, 2024, the day of the welfare check request but couldn't find her, citing hoarding piles as a major factor. They also sent a drone in the house, but it hit cobwebs and became disabled, police said. More searches, they said, were conducted on July 5, July 11, July 12 and Nov. 20.",
      "On Feb. 24, an environmental services crew arrived with a small excavator. Plywood was removed from the front door area and crews used the excavator to carefully remove the contents of the home through the opening. Notarangelo's remains were discovered within minutes, police said.",
      "An attorney was assigned to handle Notarangelo's estate in March. He did not return phone and email messages Wednesday.",
      "Relatives of Notarangelo, including her brother and niece, declined to comment.",

      "With the appointments approved Wednesday, five of the state\u2019s 12 public universities will be led by former Republican lawmakers or lobbyists, a move that will help bolster DeSantis' legacy in higher education that could long outlast his time in office.",
      "Leading a Florida university generally comes with a multiyear contract for a salary of at least six-figures and a plush on-campus residence.

      "The university in Williamsburg said the foundation is nearly completely intact. Archaeologists also uncovered a cellar that is layered with centuries of artifacts, including slate pencil fragments and jewelry.",
      "The schoolhouse was later used as a dormitory, housing some of the first generations of women to attend college in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe roots of our city and university entwine here,\" said Katherine A. Rowe, William & Mary\u2019s president. \"Every layer of history that it reveals gives us new insights into our early republic, from the Williamsburg Bray School through the generations that followed, up through the early 20th century.\u201d",
      "The Williamsburg Bray School taught hundreds of mostly enslaved students in the 1760s. The school rationalized slavery within a religious framework. And yet becoming literate also gave them more agency, with students sharing what they learned with family members.",
      "The schoolhouse then became a private home before it was incorporated into William & Mary\u2019s growing campus. The building was expanded for various purposes, including student housing, and later moved from its original location.",

It was then moved to the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, a living history museum that includes parts of the original city. The museum has restored the schoolhouse and is working to identify the students' descendants.",
      "Meanwhile, archaeologists with Colonial Williamsburg recently uncovered the foundation and cellar during a major project by William & Mary to renovate a university building, Gates Hall. The school's archaeologists are also involved.",
      "Tom Higgins of William & Mary\u2019s Center for Archaeological Research said the cellar is not lined with bricks and \u201cwas probably dug soon after the foundations were laid.\u201d",

      "Investigators say runway lights that would have helped guide a small jet into a San Diego airport in foggy weather before it crashed and killed all six aboard hadn't worked since 2022",
      "The runway lights that would have helped guide a small jet into a San Diego airport in foggy weather before the plane crashed, killing all six aboard, hadn't worked since 2022, investigators said. But it's unclear whether the pilot who was based at the airport knew the lights were out service.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board's issued its preliminary report Wednesday on the early morning crash of May 22 that also injured eight people on the ground. It confirmed that the Cessna came in too low as it approached the airport and struck power lines before the plane broke apart, crashing in a nearby neighborhood. The plane struck one home and that 20 vehicles were also damaged by the crash and ensuing fire.",
      "The jet was carrying a music executive named Dave Shapiro and five others. No one in the neighborhood of U.S. Navy housing died, but eight people were treated for smoke inhalation from the fiery crash and non-life-threatening injuries after the crash near Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport.",
      "The pilot acknowledged the weather conditions for landing at the small airport were not ideal and debated diverting to a different airport while discussing the visibility with an air traffic controller at a regional Federal Aviation Administration control facility, according to audio of the conversation posted by LiveATC.net.",
      "The FAA had posted an official notice for pilots that the runway alignment lights were out of service, but the NTSB said that had been the case since March 2022. Repairs to those lights had been delayed while waiting for an environmental study. The NTSB said it appeared the pilot tried to activate the lights by keying his microphone seven times while approaching the airport.",
      "The NTSB said the pilot was based out of the executive airport near where the crash occurred. Shapiro had a pilot's license and was listed as the owner of the plane. But the preliminary report did not say whether investigators have determined whether the pilot knew the runway lights were not working.",
      "A power surge had also knocked out the weather system at the airport but the pilot was aware of the fog and an air traffic controller gave him weather information from Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) to the north.",
      "The NTSB said the plane was only about 60 feet (18 meters) above the ground when it struck the power lines above the neighborhood. The NTSB said the plane should have been flying almost 200 feet (60 meters) higher as it approached the airport.",
      "Wednesday's report does not list the cause of the crash. That won't be officially determined until the final report is done sometime next year.",

The suit, filed Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor Derek Dixon, alleges Perry used his influence in the entertainment industry to prevent Dixon from speaking out until now.",
      "Matthew Boyd, an attorney representing Perry, denied the allegations in a statement obtained by CBS News on Tuesday.",
      "\"This is an individual who got close to Tyler Perry for what now appears to be nothing more than setting up a scam,\" the statement said. \"But Tyler will not be shaken down and we are confident these fabricated claims of harassment will fail.\"",
      "Dixon appeared on 85 episodes of \"The Oval,\" which has had a six-season run on the network BET. The actor's most recent appearances came during the latest season of the series earlier this year, according to IMDB. His lawsuit seeks at least $260 million in damages.",
      "\"Mr. Perry took his success and power and used his considerable influence in the entertainment industry to create a coercive, sexually exploitative dynamic with Mr. Dixon\u2014initially promising him career advancement and creative opportunities, such as producing his pilot and casting him in his show, only to subject him to escalating sexual harassment, assault and battery, and professional retaliation when Mr. Dixon did not reciprocate Mr. Perry's unwanted advances,\" the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It alleges the behavior happened during Dixon's time as a series regular on \"The Oval,\" when Perry \"held direct control over his employment, compensation, and creative opportunities.\"",

      "The lawsuit alleges Perry eventually sexually assaulted Dixon on \"multiple occasions,\" including an instance where he \"forcibly pulled off Mr. Dixon's clothing, groped his buttocks, and attempted to force himself on Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon clearly told Perry \"No,\" but was initially ignored until he was able to de-escalate the situation and change the subject, according to the lawsuit.",

      "The lawsuit describes several other alleged assaults. In one of those alleged instances, the suit claims Perry climbed into bed with Dixon, uninvited, and groped him while Dixon was staying in a guest room at Perry's house.",
      "It also alleges that Dixon eventually moved from Atlanta, home to Perry's production studio, to Los Angeles to put distance between the two of them, but \"Mr. Perry continued to sexually harass Mr. Dixon.\"",
      "Dixon in 2024 filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, according to the lawsuit. The suit alleges that Dixon quit the show when its producer's did not take action to investigate his accusations, even after he had filed that complaint with the EEOC.",

    "published": "Wed, 18 Jun 2025 09:29:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 20:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Prison staff gave R. Kelly \"an amount of medicine that could have killed him,\" his lawyer alleged in a federal court filing.",
    "story": [
      "R. Kelly was hospitalized for an overdose after prison staff gave him \"an amount of medicine that could have killed him\" and was later forcibly removed from a hospital against medical advice, his lawyer alleged in a statement to CBS News and a federal court filing.",
      "The disgraced singer's lawyer, Beau Brindley, is requesting that a judge move him to home detention from the North Carolina prison where he is serving his sentences.",
      "\"Mr. Kelly's life is in danger and the threat comes from Bureau of Prisons officers whose duty is to protect him,\" Brindley wrote in a court motion filed Monday.",
      "He alleges the federal Bureau of Prisons is \"seeking to kill\" Kelly \"to cover up crimes committed in the investigation of his case.\"",
      "When asked for a comment Tuesday about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Bureau of Prisons told CBS News, \"For privacy, safety and security reasons, we do not discuss the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual, including medical and health-related issues.\" The bureau also said it does not comment on pending litigation or legal proceedings.",
      "Duke University Hospital, where Kelly was taken, deferred comment to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "Court documents obtained by CBS News show Kelly's legal team discuss the emergency release request with Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Julien in back-and-forth filings this week. \"Kelly has never taken responsibility for his years of sexually abusing children, and he probably never will,\" Julien said in a response filed Monday. \"Undeterred, Kelly now asks this Court to release him from incarceration indefinitely under the guise of a fanciful conspiracy.\"",
      "Kelly was moved to solitary confinement earlier in June, according to the motion filed Monday. He had his medication for anxiety and to help him sleep with him and had shown that to prison staff, Brindley said.",
      "But, on Thursday evening, prison personnel \"provided him with additional medication and instructions to take it,\" Brindley alleges. Kelly took the medication and the next morning he felt faint and dizzy.",
      "\"He started to see black spots in his vision. Mr. Kelly tried to get up, but fell to the ground. He crawled to the door of the cell and lost consciousness,\" according to Brindley's motion.",
      "Kelly was taken to a hospital where he was told he was given an overdose quantity of his medications, Brindley said.",
      "Additionally, at the hospital, Kelly showed doctors his swollen leg, which Brindley said he had been seeking medical attention for because he has a history of blood clots. Prison medical staff had allegedly taken him off blood thinners.",
      "A scan at the hospital \"revealed blood clots in his right leg, blood clots in his left leg, and blood clots in his lungs,\" Brindley said.",
      "Kelly was told he would need to stay at the hospital for seven days and was scheduled for a surgery for the clots, according to the motion. However, officers then came into his hospital room and removed Mr. Kelly.",
      "\"He was taken from the hospital against his will and against the directives of the doctors,\" Brindley said. \"Mr. Kelly's life is in jeopardy right now because the Bureau of Prisons denied him necessary surgery to clear clots from his lungs. He could die from this condition, and they are letting it happen.\"",
      "This is not the first time Kelly's attorney has sought to move him from federal custody\u00a0over alleged threats to his life. Earlier in June, Brindley claimed prison officials recruited a white supremacist to kill Kelly.",
      "Kelly was convicted of racketeering and sex trafficking in New York in 2021 and of child pornography in Chicago a year later. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison in the New York case and 20 years in prison in the Chicago case, which he is serving mostly simultaneously.",

      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money.",
      "The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation.",
      "Plasencia and the woman, Jasveen Sangha, had been scheduled to face trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",

His cause of death was \"the acute effects of ketamine,\" with contributing factors including drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid addiction.",
      "Ketamine is a Schedule III hallucinogen. It is a controlled substance with legitimate uses, but it is also used illegally, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Martin Estrada told reporters during a news conference last year, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "\"It can cause serious health effects, serious health problems including loss of consciousness, including spikes in blood pressure and respiratory issues that can deprive the brain of oxygen,\" Estrada said. \"For that reason, it is a drug that must be administered by medical professionals and the patient must be monitored closely.\"",
      "\"That did not occur here,\" he said.",
      "Perry had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. He began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.",
      "Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.",
      "He admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.",
      "\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between the Los Angeles area where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.",
      "After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Plasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.",
      "Perry was also getting ketamine from another source, Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.",
      "Sangha has pleaded not guilty \u2014 making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.",
      "Erik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "None of the defendants have yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.",
      "Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on \"Friends,\" when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC's megahit.",

    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",

      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

    "summary": "The Beach Boys founder who helped created the \"sun & surf\" soundtrack for the American summer has a new album, a new tour, and an acclaimed film bio, \"Love & Mercy\"",
    "story": [
      "For half a century, Beach Boys songs like \"Fun, Fun, Fun\"  have promised unending summers of fun in the sun -- not at all like the life founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson actually led for many years, as Anthony Mason tells us now in our Sunday Profile:",
      "On a warm summer night at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles last month, Brian Wilson -- backed by a band that included fellow former Beach Boy Al Jardine -- was running through his repertoire of classics when a cake was wheeled out from backstage by the extended Wilson family.",
      "On this night, the man many regard as one of America's greatest living songwriters turned 73.",
      "Well, East coast girls are hip, \tI really dig those styles they wear. \tAnd the Southern girls, with the way they talk, \tThey knock me out when I'm down there. \tThe Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright. \tAnd the Northern girls with the way they kiss \tThey keep their boyfriends warm at night.",
      "I wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California girls.",
      "-- \"California Girls,\" by Brian Wilson and Mike Love (1965)",
      "Wilson, who created the sun & surf sound that's still the soundtrack for the American summer, has had a summer of milestones. On tour again, he has just released his 11th solo album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" and is the subject of a new film about his life, \"Love & Mercy.\"",
      "Mason asked, \"How did you feel when you saw the film?\"",
      "\"I was very happy to see the good parts,\" Wilson said. \"But the dark periods were, like, very rough to watch.\"",
      "John Cusack plays an older Brian Wilson, the artist struggling to recover from depression, mental illness and drug abuse. Paul Dano pays the younger Brian Wilson, the musical genius who dreams up the Beach Boys' intricate harmonies and orchestrations.",
      "Wilson was just 20 when the Beach Boys signed with Capitol Records and made their first album in an L.A. studio.",
      "Mason asked, \"Do you remember recording in this room?\"",
      "\"I remember recording 'If everybody had an ocean across the USA ...'\" Wilson said.",
      "He would create the most successful band in America, blending the voices of his brothers Dennis and Carl, cousin Mike Love, and close friend Al Jardine. \"Mike on bass, Al and Dennis and Carl in the mid-range, and me on falsetto. We all sang together. And the harmony just happened.\"",
      "\"Love & Mercy\" focuses on two pivotal points in Wilson's life: First, the recording of The Beach Boys' highly-influential \"Pet Sounds\" album in 1965, that featured \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows.\"",
      "\"I was so proud of that album, I could have cried,\" said Wilson. \"Very proud of it.\"",
      "\"Your father fought you about it, and the band fought you about it,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",
      "Landy eventually cut Melinda off from Brian.",
      "\"I saw her for three years. And then Dr. Landy severed the relationship,\" said Wilson.",
      "And how did he respond to that? \"Negatively,\" he said. \"I said, 'Tat's not fair, Gene. That's not fair.'\"",
      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",
      "Landy's grip on Wilson was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Brian's will had been revised -- with Landy named as his main beneficiary.",
      "They eventually won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient. Brian Wilson's nine-year ordeal was over.",
      "Brian and Melinda were married in 1995. They have five adopted children together.",
      "The song \"One Kind of Love,\" on Brian Wilson's new album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" is dedicated to Melinda.  (To hear Wilson perform the song click on the video player below.)",
      "Just driftwood floating on the sea, \tSearching for the me and all that I have known to be. \tThank God that you noticed me, \tAnd brought back harmony to this lonely soul.",
      "Mason asked, \"How important was Melinda in you getting through that?\"",
      "\"Well, she got me bailed out of it,\" Wilson said. \"She got me out of the program. She was my hero.\"",
      "\"He is really strong -- people don't get that about him,\" Melinda said. \"They think he's passive and just sits around. But he's strong.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment when you knew you'd actually won?\"",
      "\"When we got married, I won,\" she laughed.",

    "summary": "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two measles vaccine doses, the CDC says.",
    "story": [
      "At least 3% of measles cases confirmed so far this year have been in people who received two doses of the measles vaccine, meaning they were fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.",
      "About three dozen of the nearly 1,200 measles infections in 2025 have been in people with two vaccine doses, the agency said Friday in its weekly update on cases. An additional 2% of cases were in people who received at least one dose of the measles vaccine.",
      "Many of the cases were in Texas, which on Tuesday\u00a0counted\u00a0a 21st confirmed measles case in someone with at least two doses of the vaccine.",
      "Lara Anton, a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services, said Monday that their first 20 cases were in children 8 years old or younger. Anton did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the additional case, which was reported on Tuesday.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said in an email their data reflects vaccination status at the time someone was exposed to the virus. This means none of the 36 vaccinated cases they confirmed Friday received their second dose as a result of post-exposure prophylaxis. Post-exposure prophylaxis is offering someone a drug or vaccine after they are exposed to a germ, to reduce the chance they will be infected or develop severe disease.",
      "The CDC says people exposed to measles can get vaccinated within 72 hours of when they were first exposed, if they are not fully immunized. \"If administered within 72 hours of initial measles exposure, MMR vaccine might provide some protection against infection or modify the clinical course of disease,\" the agency's recommendations say.",
      "The CDC spokesperson said, \"The MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles and its complications.\"",
      "\"Disease symptoms are generally milder in vaccinated people,\" the spokesperson said. \"People who are vaccinated are also less likely to spread the disease to other people.\"",
      "\"The decision to vaccinate is a personal one,\" the spokesperson said. \"People should consult with their healthcare provider to understand their options to get a vaccine and should be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines.\"",
      "Texas has seen a deadly outbreak of the highly contagious virus this year. While cases there have recently slowed, CDC officials have said that authorities have been tracking more outbreaks in other communities across the U.S. linked to travel outside and inside the country.",
      "\"Additional cases have been seeded from the outbreak in Texas, as well as related outbreaks in Mexico and Canada. Additionally, measles importation from international travel continues, especially as the busy summer of travel season ramps up,\" Brian Wakeman, deputy lead of the CDC's measles laboratory task force, said Monday.",
      "Wakeman, who spoke on a nationwide call for testing laboratories, said the U.S. is now on pace to top the 1,274 cases of measles seen in 2019. That was the most cases the U.S. has seen in a single year since endemic spread of the virus was declared \"eliminated\" at the end of the 20th century.",
      "\"We're also on pace to be the greatest number of measles cases since the early 90s,\" Wakeman said.",
      "None of the confirmed measles cases that led to hospitalizations this year had documented evidence of receiving two doses of vaccine, the CDC spokesperson said. More than 8 in 10 of the cases have been in people 20 years old or older.",
      "Six cases of measles in people who received at least two doses of the vaccine were in Colorado, that state's health department says.",
      "\"None of the six cases with 2+ doses were seniors or required hospitalization,\" Hope Shuler, a spokesperson for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, said in an email.",
      "Health authorities and experts have called for some seniors to check if they need a measles booster, especially if they are planning to travel, because of the kind of measles vaccines that were used before 1968.",
      "\"That group is unlikely to have robust immunity from infection, because at that point in time, they were using less effective vaccines,\" said Dr. Celine Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 15:40:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",
      "The SNAP program's current work requirement only applies to people up to age 54.",
      "If the bill's higher age threshold is enacted, about 1 million Americans between 55 to 64 would be at risk of losing food stamps, according to the CBPP.",
      "\"It's so much harder at that age to find a job, based on age discrimination, outdated skills and you may have health issues that don't rise up to a full disability,\" Salaam Bhatti, director of the SNAP program at the Food Research & Action Center, an anti-hunger advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"What it ultimately does is just remove them from the program that's helping them put food on the table.\"",
      "Some advocacy groups for older Americans are urging lawmakers to rethink hiking SNAP's work requirement to age 64, as well as adding the employment requirement for Medicaid.",
      "\"We oppose efforts to add new burdens that could cost people their health care coverage not because they are ineligible, but because they missed a deadline or could not navigate a complex system,\" wrote AARP President Nancy LeaMond in a May 21 letter\u00a0to Johnson and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries.",
      "The higher age limit for SNAP's work requirements \"is especially harmful to older adults who often face age discrimination, longer unemployment, chronic health conditions and caregiving responsibilities that limit their ability to stay in the workforce,\" she added.",

      "\"The ideologically motivated directives to terminate grants alleged to constitute DEI, 'gender ideology,' or other forbidden topics were, in fact, arbitrary and capricious, and have now been ruled unlawful,\" Dr. Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement Tuesday.

      "The court has not yet published Young's order in the case, but notes from the clerk announced that the challenged directives have been vacated and that the Trump administration was ordered to \"promptly comply.\"",
      "Separate court cases are underway for other cuts to medical research funding sought by the Trump administration, like the terminations of funding to universities like Harvard and Columbia that have disrupted studies for cancer and diseases.",

      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",

      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is now urging summer camp operators to check for documentation of immunity from\u00a0measles\u00a0through vaccination or prior infection for all children, staff and volunteers, amid a deadly year of outbreaks that is now near record levels.",
      "\"Measles can spread quickly in summer camps because campers and staff spend a lot of time together in close contact with each other. Measles is more than just a rash \u2014 it can cause serious complications or even death,\" the CDC warned in a \"checklist\" for operators of summer camps published this week.",
      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration keeps delaying enforcement of a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "The president announced Thursday that he signed an executive order pushing back the deadline for enforcing a law passed by Congress until mid-September \u2014 the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January. The previous extension expired Thursday. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "\"I've just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),\" the president wrote on Truth Social Thursday. \"Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension.",
      "\"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's office,\" the TikTok statement said.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the president would sign the executive order delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before a January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u00a0resumed\u00a0more aggressive workplace immigration enforcement earlier this week after briefly pausing arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants last week.",
      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

      "\"As part of the production transition from the U.S. to the Mexico facility, the supplier increased staffing levels to build parts inventory and mitigate potential supply disruptions associated with the move. However, due to insufficient training, the staking process was not performed, resulting in brake pedals with unstaked pivot pins,\" the NHTSA stated in its report.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it will maintain the benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve said Wednesday it is holding its benchmark interest rate steady, marking a continuation of its \"wait-and-see\" approach as it assesses the impact of the Trump administration's economic policies.",
      "The central bank also expects inflation to worsen in the coming months, but it still foresees two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, the same as it projected in March.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a Wednesday press conference to discuss the rate decision.",
      "By the numbers",
      "The central bank on Wednesday said it will maintain the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "The rate has remained at that level since President Trump took office in January. The last time the Fed cut rates was in December 2024, when it trimmed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed say about the economy?",
      "When determining rate cuts, the Fed's goal is to keep inflation low and maintain a healthy job market. In its announcement\u00a0Wednesday, the central bank mentioned solid labor market conditions and an economy that continues to grow at a \"solid pace\" although it also signaled caution.",
      "\"Uncertainty about the economic outlook has diminished but remains elevated,\" the Fed wrote in its announcement.",
      "At the Wednesday press conference, Powell underscored the relative strength of the economy, citing solid labor market conditions including the 4.2% unemployment rate, a low inflation rate and improvements in business and consumer sentiment. But he added that the Trump administration's new tariffs are likely to drive up inflation and slow down growth in the economy this year.",
      "In its latest\u00a0quarterly projections\u00a0for the economy and interest rates, the Fed said it expects that inflation as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index will pick up to 3% by year end. The central bank also expects unemployment to edge higher to 4.5%, up from the current 4.2%.",
      "\"The thing that every outside forecaster and the Fed is saying is that we expect a meaningful amount of inflation to arrive in coming months, and we have to take that into account,\" Powell said.",
      "The inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.4% in May, still above the Fed's target rate of 2%. There has been speculation that Mr. Trump's tariffs could drive up inflation, but so far it has largely remained in check.",
      "Powell said that he expect the Fed will learn a \"great deal more\" on tariffs over the summer and that the developments will inform their thinking moving forward. In the meantime, the Fed Chair said the central bank is well positioned to hold off on rate cuts. \"Because the economy is still solid, we can take the time to actually see what's going to happen,\" he said.",
      "More tariff changes are expected in the coming months. President Trump's 90-day-pause on reciprocal tariffs ends July 9.",
      "When will the Fed cut rates?",
      "Fed officials said they predict two interest rate cuts by the end of this year, in keeping with what they projected in March, but did not specify when future cuts might happen.",
      "\"What we're waiting for to reduce rates is to understand what will happen with the tariff inflation,\" Powell told reporters.",
      "Others, meanwhile, are betting a rate reduction will come in September. Economists give a roughly 60% probability that the Fed will reduce the federal funds rate at its September 17 meeting, according to financial data firm FactSet.",
      "But analysts also remain cautious in their predictions. \"If the June and July inflation measures remain tepid \u2014 and especially if the labor market starts to show signs of weakness \u2014 that could have investors wondering if the Fed may consider a cut at its July 29-30 meeting,\" said eToro U.S. investment analyst Bret Kenwell in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What does this mean for your money?",
      "The federal funds rate reflects the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans. A higher benchmark rate can make borrowing more expensive for businesses and consumers because it helps determine what businesses and consumers pay in interest on loans and credit card debt.",
      "When the benchmark rate is lowered, loan rates tend to follow, making it less expensive to borrow money.",
      "With the Fed keeping rates steady, it's unlikely that borrowers will see near-term relief on their lending costs.",
      "\"This is music to the ears of savers, like retirees, that are earning good income on their hard-earned savings,\" said Bankrate's chief financial analyst Greg McBride in an email. \"But it underscores the urgency for borrowers to aggressively pay down high-cost credit card debt and offers little hope of a significant drop in interest rates any time soon.\"",
      "What has President Trump said about interest rates?",

    "story": [
      "Social Security is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, when the federal retirement program will be required to cut monthly benefits by about 20%.",
      "The new projection, issued Wednesday in the Social Security Board of Trustees'\u00a0annual report,\u00a0is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees, the report said. Last year's report had forecast\u00a0that the program would need to cut benefits starting in 2035, impacting Social Security's 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "The Social Security program has been staring down a financial crunch for years, although the trust funds' depletion date can change from year to year due to fluctuations in the economy and the number of beneficiaries. The trust fund is slated to be depleted partly due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population, which means its reserves are drawing down because spending is outpacing income.",
      "\"Congress, along with the Social Security Administration and others committed to eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, must work together to protect and strengthen the trust funds for the millions of Americans who rely on it \u2014 now and in the future \u2014 for a secure retirement or in the event of a disability,\" said Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security, in a statement.",
      "Here's the impact on your benefits",
      "Even if the trust funds are depleted \u2014 which may not occur if Congress makes changes to how the program is funded, for instance \u2014 benefits won't suddenly disappear.",
      "Instead, Social Security beneficiaries would see a 19% cut to their benefits, the report said.",
      "The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, which means a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600.",
      "The new report is a wake-up call that lawmakers need to move quickly to shore up the program, some advocacy groups for seniors said on Wednesday.",
      "\"Congress must act to protect and strengthen the Social Security that Americans have earned and paid into throughout their working lives,\" said AARP CEO Myechia Minter-Jordan in an email. \"More than 69 million Americans rely on Social Security today and as America's population ages, the stability of this vital program only becomes more important.\"",
      "Shoring up Social Security",
      "There are two ways to shore up Social Security, by either raising more revenue or cutting benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the program, in an email. \"Any politician who doesn't support increasing Social Security's revenue is, by default, supporting benefit cuts,\" she said.",
      "One method of raising more revenue for the program would be lift its income cap, which stands at $176,100. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "\"In poll after poll, the American people are clear that they strongly support making the wealthy pay their fair share into Social Security, and overwhelmingly oppose benefit cuts,\" Altman said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have suggested increasing the retirement age to as high as 70 as a way to fix the program's finances, but that would effectively act as a benefits cut for retirees, said Max Richtman, CEO of National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, in a statement.",
      "\"Current and future seniors (nearly 50% of whom rely on their benefits for all or most of their income) \u2014 should not be asked to bear the cost of improving the program's finances,\" he added.",
      "Changes to Social Security",
      "One of the changes to Social Security this year that will have a \"substantial\" impact on the program is the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, the report said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, about 3.2 million recipients are getting higher benefits, ranging from modest increases to more than $1,000 a month in additional money, the agency has said.",
      "Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, the program's data shows. The number of people claiming benefits jumped 17% to 1.8 million\u00a0in 2025 through May versus the same period a year earlier, putting the program on track to enroll 4 million new beneficiaries in 2025.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the\u00a0Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0at the agency and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, which had already been struggling to provide services to retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "Anxieties about the stability of the program likely prompted some of the new filings, experts have told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Medicare's outlook",
      "Separately, the Medicare Board of Trustees issued a report Wednesday that said the health insurance program for people over 65 is facing a financial crunch in 2033, at which point it wouldn't be able to pay 100% of benefits.",
      "Instead, the program's revenues would only cover 89% of its costs at that point, the report said.",

      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",

      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",
      "Ethics issues raised",
      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",
      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"It threatens to be a real distortion of the economy around the Trump brand,\" he said. \"My message to hard-working Americans is to slam down the phone in the face of this marketing ploy.\"",
      "What does Trump Mobile phone plan include?",
      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",
      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0with a price tag of $499, requiring a down payment of $100. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The Trump Organization website says the T1 Phone will be available in August, although the Trump Mobile website states the phone will debut in September.",
      "The device, which will have a fingerprint sensor and the ability to unlock using face recognition, will include 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12gb of RAM. It uses the Android operating system.",
      "It's unclear what company will manufacture the devices, with the Trump Mobile website noting that its products and services \"are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.\" The website adds that the T1 Phone LLC is using the \"Trump\" name as part of a limited license agreement.",
      "\"I think we're going to really shake up the space in a very big way, both in terms of the actual hardware of the films and then obviously e-sim cards, and then just what you get for a plan per month,\" Eric Trump added.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve Bank is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its meeting on Wednesday, maintaining the same cautious posture it has assumed throughout the first half of 2025.",
      "That's according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, which as of June 18, 2025, shows a likelihood of 99.9% that the Fed will keep the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. CME Group is the parent company of the Chicago Board of Trade and other exchanges.",
      "The benchmark interest rate has been at its current range since December.",
      "The Fed has held off on cutting rates since President Trump took office, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been publicly urging the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, most recently this month, after a new employment report showed job creation slowed in May.",
      "Keeping the rate unchanged would signal ongoing caution from the Fed as it continues to monitor how Mr. Trump's economic policies will play out.",
      "\"Recent Fed commentary has reinforced a wait-and-see approach, with officials signaling little urgency to adjust policy amid increased uncertainty around the economic outlook,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, the uncertainty brought on by the president's tariffs hasn't fully faded. The inflation rate also\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0in May to 2.4%, compared with 2.3% in April.",
      "Even though job growth is slowing, the labor market continues to hold up, with payroll gains\u00a0exceeding economists' expectations\u00a0last month.",
      "\"The current data do not support that theory that prices are rising or that the labor market is weakening quickly,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting.",
      "When is the FOMC meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) \u2014 the 12-member group that sets rate decisions \u2014 will meet on June 17-18. The FOMC's decision will be announced on Wednesday, the second day of the meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate announcement?",
      "The Fed will share the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on June 18. Powell will then discuss the committee's decision at a press conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. that same day.",
      "The meeting will also include an economic forecast that touches on how interest rates are expected to change in coming years.",
      "One thing to watch will be whether the decision is unanimous, or if there is any dissent from voting members, said Mulberry. A divided decision would mark a shift from May's meeting, when\u00a0all 12 members\u00a0voted to hold the benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"Some members have been expressing concerns about slowing growth, although very slightly, and that should be debated heavily as a driver to cut rates sooner rather than continuing to pause,\" he said in an email.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Not likely. Echoing CME's data, economist polled by FactSet predict a 97.5% probability the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"There is a tendency to romanticize the idea of interest rates coming down, but with the economy chugging along and a lot of uncertainty about what happens with inflation, there is nothing compelling the Fed to cut interest rates right now,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email.",
      "The last time the Fed made a reduction was in December 2024, when it slashed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "While the Fed's decision to hold rates steady may be unwelcome news for the nation's borrowers, it would bode well for savers who benefit from higher interest rates. Schulz said now is to the time for people to shop for high-yield savings accounts or to lock in CD rates. \"Those returns aren't as high as they were a year ago, but they're still really strong,\" he said in an email.",
      "The moment could also be ripe for paying down high-cost credit card debt and padding your emergency savings, said McBride.",
      "If the Fed holds steady, Americans can expect credit card rates, auto loans and mortgages to remain high. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently hovering around 7% while credit card rates have skyrocketed to\u00a0over 20%.",
      "But that's not to say that a rate cute would necessarily bring down borrowing rates for homebuyers, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in a research note.",
      "\"Even a Fed rate cut isn't a guarantee that mortgage rates would fall, since the Fed doesn't impact mortgage rates as directly as it does credit cards,\" said Schulz. \"However, the Fed does impact rates indirectly, so a rate cut, whenever it eventually arrives, would likely be a hopeful signal for shoppers.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel have finalized their partnership and revealed new details about the deal.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel announced Wednesday that they have finalized their long-awaited partnership.",
      "Under the announced agreement, U.S. Steel will retain its name and headquarters in Pittsburgh. The steel will continue to be \"mined, melted and made\" in the United States, the companies said. The partnership is expected to create more than 100,000 jobs throughout the U.S., and will feature \"unprecedented massive investments in steelmaking in the United States,\" the companies said in their announcement.",
      "A deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel was first proposed in late 2023. Then-President Joe Biden\u00a0rejected the deal\u00a0on national security grounds near the end of his time in office, but President Trump\u00a0ordered a new review\u00a0of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities\u00a0rather than fully acquiring\u00a0the company.",
      "On June 13, Mr. Trump cleared the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel. The companies say they have \"now completed the transaction as contemplated by their merger agreement.\"",
      "The companies have also entered into a National Security Agreement with the U.S. government.",
      "Under that agreement, Nippon Steel has agreed to make about $11 billion in new investments in U.S. Steel by 2028, including an initial investment in a greenfield project that will be completed after 2028, they said. The agreement also requires that the majority of members of U.S. Steel's board of directors and key management personnel, including its CEO, be U.S. citizens, and says that U.S. Steel will remain a U.S.-incorporated entity.",
      "Takashi Mori, Nippon Steel's representative director and vice chairman, will serve as chairman of the board of U.S. Steel, according to the news release.",
      "The United Steelworkers union issued a statement accusing the companies of \"down-playing concerns\" about what the deal would mean over the long-term.",
      "\"As the sale concludes, it seems likely that attention will dissipate,\" USW president\u00a0David McCall\u00a0said. \"However, our union will remain. We will continue watching, holding Nippon to its commitments. And we will use the most powerful tool workers have against global corporations: collective bargaining.\" The union's current contract agreement expires in September 2026.",
      "The deal announced Wednesday requires that U.S. Steel maintain capacity to produce and supply steel from U.S. production locations to meet market demand in the country, and says that Nippon Steel will not \"prevent, prohibit, or otherwise interfere with U.S. Steel's ability to pursue trade action under U.S. law.\"",
      "The company will also issue a \"golden share\" to the U.S. government, which will give the president the power to approve or veto a number of major corporate decisions, and gives the U.S. government the right to appoint one independent director.",
      "The deal comes as Mr. Trump recently doubled tariffs on foreign steel imports.",
      "\"This is a momentous day for our country, our communities, and the American steel industry,\" said U.S. Steel CEO Dave Burritt in a news release announcing the partnership details. \"Thanks to President Trump's bold leadership, American workers secured the best possible deal. U. S. Steel will remain rooted in the United States and continue to call Pittsburgh home. Through our partnership with Nippon Steel, we are poised to grow better and bigger, with transformative investment, cutting-edge technology, and the creation of good-paying jobs across the United States.\"",
      "Nippon Steel has manufacturing bases in more than a dozen countries, including Japan, India and Mexico.",
      "U.S. Steel has been headquartered in Pittsburgh since 1901, and has operations elsewhere in the U.S. and in Central Europe.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:50:16 -0400",
    "summary": "The bill was stalled for weeks amid Democratic pushback and contentious amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate passed a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It passed the Senate in a 68 to 30 vote.",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, who introduced the measure, said the legislation \"ushers in a new era of payments.\"",
      "\"The prospect of faster and cheaper payments will have far-reaching implications for our financial system,\" he said Tuesday. \"Once the GENIUS Act is law, businesses of all sizes and Americans across the country will be able to settle payments nearly instantaneously, rather than waiting for days or sometimes even weeks. Put simply, stablecoins are a paradigm-shifting development that can bring our payment system into the 21st century.\"",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",
      "Two Republicans have also consistently voted against the legislation \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 albeit for different reasons. Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",
      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively. Doing nothing and protecting the status quo is not only irresponsible, it's unacceptable,\" she said on the Senate floor last week.",
      "Gillibrand acknowledged that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is \"extremely unhelpful\" but argued it \"does not diminish the excellent work in this legislation.\"",

    "summary": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, said he expects the company to reduce its workforce over the next few years as it rolls out more generative AI and agents.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",
      "Jassy's pledge to invest in AI comes after the company announced in May that it would cut 100 jobs in its devices and services\u00a0unit, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed.",

    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 17:04:33 -0400",
    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

    "summary": "The GOP's \"big beautiful bill\" would require people up to age 64 to certify they're working to get aid. Here's what the research shows.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican's\u00a0\"big beautiful\" budget package\u00a0would add new work requirements for millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid and food stamps. Tying federal aid in exchange for work is \"common sense,\" according to House Speaker Mike Johnson, who\u00a0said\u00a0it would encourage people to get jobs.",
      "While the food stamp program already has a work requirement, the GOP bill tightens the regulation for beneficiaries, requiring those who are so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, to prove they're working up to age 64, up from the current threshold of 54 years old.",
      "Taken together, the new requirements would add reporting requirements for millions of low-income Americans, who would need to prove they're working or else volunteering or enrolled in an educational program to qualify for health care or food assistance. Republican lawmakers say it makes sense to tack on these restrictions to ensure that people aren't \"gaming the system,\" in Johnson's words, while also encouraging them to seek employment.",
      "There are millions of people on Medicaid \"right now nationwide who are able-bodied workers, young men, for example, who are not working, who are taking advantage of the system,\" Johnson told CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on May 25.",
      "\"The One, Big, Beautiful Bill's work requirements \u2014 which include activities such as volunteering, job training, or looking for a job \u2014 are commonsense reforms that are overwhelmingly popular among the American people,\" a White House official told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These reforms will not only address waste, fraud and abuse, but protect and preserve Medicaid for the Americans whom the program was intended to serve as a lifeline for: seniors, disabled individuals, and low income families.\"",
      "About two-thirds of Americans back work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid, according to a 2023 Axios poll.",
      "Growing body of research",
      "Work requirements were first\u00a0introduced\u00a0into the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) \u2014 the formal name for the food-stamp program \u2014 under President Bill Clinton. And two states, Arkansas and Georgia, have in recent years introduced work requirements for Medicaid recipients, although Arkansas dropped its plan after a judge blocked it in 2019.",
      "That's allowed economists and policy experts to study work requirements and how they have impacted people who rely on food assistance and public health insurance. So far, there's little evidence to show work requirements boost employment among the low-income Americans who rely on the programs.",
      "Instead, some recipients end up losing their benefits after work requirements are introduced due to administrative hurdles of proving employment, failure to find enough work to qualify, or other issues like disability or illness, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Take a 2019 research paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, which examined what happened when Virginia reinstated work requirements for some food stamp recipients in 2013. The researchers found that after work requirements went into effect, SNAP enrollment of people who were subject to the regulation dropped by about 50%.",
      "\"But it did not lead to any meaningful increase in employment or earnings on average,\" Adam Leive, an assistant professor at the Goldman School of Public Policy at University of California, Berkeley, and a coauthor of the paper, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"And so, what we instead found was that work requirements largely functioned as a way to remove people from the program, but without improving their employment prospects.\"",
      "He added, \"Our results probably provide some evidence as to what would be expected in Medicaid.\"",
      "The GOP budget measure passed in the House in May with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. On Tuesday, the Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of the bill. While it changes some of the House version's provisions, it continues to include the Medicaid work requirement for adults between 19 to 64 who aren't disabled and don't have children.",
      "The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry's portion of the bill, also released Tuesday, maintains the House version's higher age threshold for the food stamp program.",
      "Medicaid and work",
      "About 18.5 million Medicaid recipients, or roughly 1 in 4 enrollees, would be subject to the new work requirement if the GOP package becomes law, according to a June 4 analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Of those, roughly 4.8 million people are likely to lose health insurance due to the new policy, it projected.",
      "\"Research and real-world experience both show that work requirements don't help people find or maintain work,\" wrote Allie Gardner, a senior policy analyst at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a policy think tank, in a June 12 research report.",
      "The new Medicaid work requirements would be particularly stringent, she added. First, the provision would deny coverage to applicants who can't show they're already working, volunteering or enrolled in an educational program for 80 hours a month before they are enrolled.",
      "States, which administer Medicaid to their residents, would be permitted to block enrollment to people who can't show they have already had months of work under their belt, she added. States could also require people to verify their employment as frequently as once per month, and require up to six months of consecutive work to keep their Medicaid enrollment, she said.",
      "The two states that have sought to introduce work requirements for Medicaid enrollees have had mixed results. In Arkansas, about 18,000 adults\u00a0lost coverage\u00a0in the first four months after the policy went into effect, out of the state's roughly 800,000 enrollees. More than half of those reported they delayed medical care and more than 6 in 10 said they delayed taking medications because of cost, according to a 2020 analysis by researchers at Harvard University's T.H. Chan School of Public Health.",
      "The requirements didn't boost employment, the researchers also found.",
      "Burdensome requirements",
      "Georgia is the only state with a current work requirement for Medicaid, offering a program targeted to certain low-income adults who wouldn't otherwise qualify. Like the GOP budget bill's provision, Georgia requires beneficiaries to perform 80 hours a month of work or other activities, such as volunteering or schooling.",
      "But that program has cost the state $86 million while enrolling 6,500 people in its first 18 months, far short of enrollment goals, partly because of the administrative burdens of verifying employment as well as technical glitches, Pro Publica has reported.",
      "One enrollee, BeShea Terry, 51, told the Associated Press that maintaining her standing in the program has been difficult, including encountering numerous erroneous messages that she hadn't uploaded proof of her work hours. When her coverage was mistakenly canceled in December, it took months of calls to a caseworker and visits to a state office to resolve, she said.",
      "\"It's a process,\" she said. \"Keep continuing to call because your health is very important.\"",
      "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp's administration has defended the program as a way to transition people to private health care. At least 1,000 people have left the program and obtained private insurance because their income increased, according to the governor's office.",
      "Older Americans at risk",
      "Some policy experts are particularly concerned about the bill that would require people up to age 64 to prove they're working in exchange for food aid or health insurance because older Americans can face greater employment struggles due to ageism, health issues or needing to care for an ill spouse or relative.",

      "At Home's court filings reveal fissures in the company's finances. At Home shuttered six stores in the last year, according to the company's Chapter 11 filing. And some macroeconomic factors like inflation and tariffs have placed \"significant pressure\" on its revenue, the company said.",

      "Fifty-five attorneys general around the country have now signed on to a $7.4 billion settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, over the opioid crisis, officials said.",
      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January. Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point,\" the company said.",

In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic.

    "story": [
      "President Trump's\u00a0executive order\u00a0on Friday clearing the way for Japan-based Nippon Steel to potentially buy U.S. Steel comes with an unusual corporate twist called a \"golden share.\"",
      "As part of the agreement, Mr. Trump will gain power to approve a number of major corporate decisions for the company, signaling that the president could potentially block the company from relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh, or transferring or relocating jobs outside the U.S.",
      "The details of the golden share were disclosed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Saturday in a social media post, where he described the agreement as including \"powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of U.S. Steel and U.S. manufacturers that will have massively expanded access to domestically produced steel.\"",
      "What is a golden share?",
      "A \"golden share\" refers to special rights held by a government over a corporate entity. They are typically granted in relation to newly privatized businesses over which the government wants to maintain some control,\u00a0according to legal research company Westlaw.",
      "Golden shares have been employed in countries ranging from the U.K. to China, although they are rare in the U.S. In the former case, the U.K. government held a golden share in the British Airports Authority, although it was ruled illegal by a court in 2003. In the latter, the Communist Party had taken a percentage ownership in private companies as well as control over government board seats and voting power, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported in 2023.",
      "While presidents can indirectly influence corporate decisions through agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, which reviews mergers for antitrust concerns, it's unusual for a commander-in-chief to exercise the level of control outlined by Lutnick regarding U.S. Steel. According to his post, U.S. Steel \u2014 which would keep its name and headquarters after the merger \u2014 also wouldn't be allowed to change its name from U.S. Steel without President Trump's approval.",
      "The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board's independent three directors and can veto the other two choices, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the terms of the agreement who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. The details of the board structure were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "\"The Art of the Deal,\" Lutnick wrote of the agreement, referencing Mr. Trump's best-selling book about his business skills and negotiating techniques.",
      "Terms remain unclear",
      "Lutnick described the golden share in the U.S. Steel deal as \"perpetual.\" The Commerce Department didn't return a request for clarification on if the golden share would transfer to subsequent presidents after Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The full terms also remain somewhat unclear. The companies have not made public the full terms of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel nor the national security agreement with the federal government.",
      "On Friday, the two companies\u00a0announced in a joint statement\u00a0that they had agreed to the terms of the government's national security agreement. They added the terms mandate $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and provides for \"a Golden Share to be issued to the U.S. Government.\"",
      "The U.S. Steelworkers union told CBS MoneyWatch that it can't comment on the golden shares without seeing more information about the agreement. But it pointed to a June 15 statement that expressed the union's disappointment with the president's decision to move forward with the merger.",
      "\"Details matter: Neither the government nor the companies have publicly identified what all the terms of the proposed transaction are,\" the union letter said. \"And, while there is a claimed 'golden share,' what can we expect from Nippon's leadership in Japan which continues to build up overcapacity in steel globally and has been charged again with dumping by the Department of Commerce just weeks ago?\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has been briefed on both the risks and the benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's most secure nuclear site.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has been briefed on both the risks and the benefits of bombing Fordo, Iran's most secure nuclear site, and his mindset is that disabling it is necessary because of the risk of weapons being produced in a relatively short period of time, multiple sources told CBS News.",
      "\"He believes there's not much choice,\" one source said. \"Finishing the job means destroying Fordo.\"",
      "The president approved attack plans on Iran on Tuesday night, but has not made a final decision on whether to strike the country and formally join Israel's air campaign, a senior intelligence source and a Defense Department official told CBS News on Wednesday.",
      "Mr. Trump held off on deciding to strike in case Tehran agrees to abandon its nuclear program, the sources said.",
      "CBS News previously reported that Mr. Trump was weighing a strike on Fordo, a subterranean uranium enrichment facility. Israel has not conducted any known strikes on Fordo since it began bombing Iranian nuclear and military targets late last week.",
      "Trump's decision",
      "Mr. Trump is willing to get the U.S. involved if that's what it takes to knock out the site, sources said. As of Thursday morning, he was still reviewing his options and has not made a firm decision either way. He has discussed the logistics of using bunker-buster bombs, two of the sources said.",
      "It was not immediately clear how much of the U.S. military infrastructure needed for a strike was in place or how much time it would take to move assets into position.",
      "One option Mr. Trump has considered is that Iran could disable Fordo on its own, if its leaders so choose, two of the sources said.",
      "David Lammy, the foreign secretary of the U.K., is set to meet with Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington later Thursday, a European official said, with active diplomacy underway to find an off-ramp in the conflict and make a take-it-or-leave-it offer to Iran. London maintains an embassy in Tehran, giving the U.K. visibility that the U.S. does not have in the Iranian capital.",
      "Mr. Trump is aware of the diplomatic effort being undertaken, with the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Great Britain, as well as the high representative of the EU, set to meet with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva on Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump has viewed intelligence reports indicating the estimated speed at which Iran could produce bombs, two of the sources said.",
      "John Ratcliffe, the CIA director, has said in closed-door settings that Iran is viewed as being very close to possessing nuclear weapons, according to multiple sources.",
      "Ratcliffe has said that claiming Iran isn't close would be similar to saying football players who have fought their way to the one-yard line don't want to score a touchdown, one U.S. official said.",
      "Congressional committees that have been briefed by senior CIA analysts have been told the intelligence community's view remains that no order to weaponize has been given by the supreme leader and that Iran has not restarted research on a delivery mechanism for a nuclear bomb.",
      "The CIA declined to comment.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Wednesday that \"so far, at least, the intelligence community has stood by its conclusion that Iran is not moving towards a nuclear weapon.\"",
      "\"They were enriching additional uranium, but they were not weaponizing that yet, and that [decision] was left with the supreme leader,\" he told reporters. \"If there has been a change in that intelligence, I need to know, and I want to make sure that if it is changed, it's based upon fact and not political influence.\"",
      "\"Things change, especially with war\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Wednesday he had not made a final decision on whether to strike Iran.",
      "\"I like to make the final decision one second before it's due, because things change, especially with war,\" he said.",
      "\"I may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do,\" he said earlier in the day, adding that he'd like Iran to negotiate on a deal to end its nuclear program.",
      "Iran \u2014 which has long insisted the program exists solely for peaceful purposes \u2014 said Wednesday it \"does NOT negotiate under duress,\" and said it would \"respond to any threat with a counter-threat.\"",
      "Iran has prepared missiles and equipment for strikes on U.S. bases in the Middle East if the U.S. joins the Israeli campaign, according to a senior U.S. intelligence official and a Pentagon official briefed on the matter.",
      "Israel began striking Iran last Friday morning. The Trump administration has said publicly it is not participating in the offensive strikes, though CBS News previously reported the U.S. has helped Israel intercept Iran's retaliatory missile strikes.",
      "In recent days, Mr. Trump has not ruled out the idea of joining Israel's campaign, saying on Truth Social his \"patience is wearing thin.\"",
      "The president said Tuesday the U.S. knows the whereabouts of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \"He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. On Sunday, CBS News reported Mr. Trump had opposed an Israeli plan to kill Khamenei.",

    "published": "Thu, 19 Jun 2025 12:09:49 -0400",
    "summary": "The Trump administration keeps delaying enforcement of a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "The president announced Thursday that he signed an executive order pushing back the deadline for enforcing a law passed by Congress until mid-September \u2014 the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January. The previous extension expired Thursday. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "\"I've just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),\" the president wrote on Truth Social Thursday. \"Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension.",
      "\"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's office,\" the TikTok statement said.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the president would sign the executive order delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before a January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action. Still, Apple and Google waited nearly a month to restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores after Mr. Trump issued the first executive order.",
      "But there's been little action from Congress in response to the Trump administration ignoring the law, despite lawmakers sounding the alarm for years that TikTok could serve as a vessel for China to spy on Americans, collect vast amounts of their data or serve them propaganda.",
      "\"The courts have been really clear on this,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, told reporters in early June. \"I think we ought to enforce the law.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Tuesday he wasn't sure whether the president had the legal authority to not enforce the law, but noted there haven't been any repercussions.",
      "\"I just want finality,\" Grassley said. \"I'd like to have the president say how much more talk are we going to put up with? I want some certainty and just [to] know that Congress isn't being played when we make a decision [for it] to be sold.\"",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Eric Swalwell is no stranger to fighting legal battles. Swalwell, in his seventh term as a Democrat representing the Bay Area of California, served as an impeachment manager in President Trump's first impeachment trial in 2020. Swalwell is also the plaintiff in a four-year civil lawsuit seeking damages from Mr. Trump for the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "But Swalwell, an attorney and former local prosecutor in Alameda County, is so concerned about legal peril during the second Trump term, he has taken out a liability insurance policy to protect himself. Swalwell confirmed he had done so in a text message to CBS News.",
      "In a social media post last month, Swalwell accused the Trump administration of targeting Democratic legislators like his colleague, New Jersey Rep. LaMonica McIver, who was charged with assaulting law enforcement officers at an immigration detention center.",
      "Swalwell \u2014 who has not been charged with a crime \u2014 wrote on X, \"A RED LINE has been crossed. Trump is prosecuting his political enemies in Congress. This is just the beginning. We must take whatever we've done before to show dissent and go one rung higher.\"",
      "Last week's handcuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who was forcibly removed from a news conference and briefly cuffed by federal agents after publicly questioning Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, has raised criticisms that the Trump administration has broken norms \u2014 and escalated tensions \u2014 by allowing federal law enforcement to arrest or detain elected officials who dissent.",
      "The Padilla incident occurred weeks after the arrests of McIver and Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, also a Democrat, after a May 9 confrontation with federal agents outside the Delaney Hall immigration facility in Newark. Prosecutors dropped the case against Baraka, but McIver faces felony charges and the prospect of a multi-year prison sentence if convicted. She has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Prosecutors allege McIver struck agents with her arms during the incident. The Department of Homeland Security accused the elected officials of \"breaking into\" the detention center.",
      "McIver responded to her indictment in a statement that said, \"The facts of this case will prove I was simply doing my job and will expose these proceedings for what they are: a brazen attempt at political intimidation.\"",
      "In the latest incident, New York City Comptroller Brad Lander, a Democrat running for mayor, was detained by immigration agents Tuesday at a Manhattan courthouse.",
      "In a sequence of events captured on video, Lander was seen holding onto a man, whom he identified as Edgardo, following the man's immigration hearing. Video then showed masked immigration agents trying to take the man into custody, and then taking Lander into custody as he asked to see a warrant.",
      "Federal law enforcement officials said Lander was arrested \"for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer.\"",
      "He was released four hours later, with his wife and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul by his side. No charges were filed against him.",
      "The series of arrests began with the case of Hannah Dugan in April. Dugan, an elected Wisconsin circuit court judge, has pleaded not guilty to charges of obstructing federal agents, for allegedly rerouting a criminal defendant from her courtroom to avoid immigration agents. Dugan's July 21 trial date was delayed Wednesday, as a judge considers a motion from Dugan to dismiss the case.",
      "Raskin alleges \"strong-arm tactics\" to \"silence and intimidate\"",
      "The arrests, detentions and handcuffings are inflaming an already toxic political moment and supercharging complaints by Democrats that Mr. Trump is seeking to use law enforcement powers to subdue his opposition.",
      "\"Trump and his enforcers want to handcuff and jail members of the legislative branch who perform oversight,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee.",
      "Raskin told CBS News, \"These strong-arm tactics are meant to silence and intimidate people, but they only strengthen our conviction.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a White House spokeswoman said, \"Here's the real story: why do so many Democrat officials feel emboldened to brazenly break the law and then complain when they are held accountable?\"",
      "\"It's alarming Democrats think they can obstruct federal law enforcement, assault ICE agents, or physically push law enforcement officers while charging a cabinet secretary, without consequence \u2014 it's even more alarming that the media is encouraging and defending this lawless behavior,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "After his case was dismissed, Baraka filed a civil suit against the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey, Alina Habba, who not only filed the criminal case, but posted about Baraka's arrest on social media. The lawsuit accuses Habba of defamation and seeks damages for what it calls \"false arrest and malicious prosecution.\"",
      "The criminal cases are a burden to public officials, who must pay legal costs and expend time on court hearings. Defense attorneys for McIver noted she has juggled initial proceedings in her case in Newark with her duties in the U.S. Capitol, during a busy month in the House since the May 9 incident.",
      "In her filing to dismiss her obstruction case, Dugan argued the Justice Department was violating separation of powers and unlawfully exceeding its authority. \"The government's prosecution here reaches directly into a state courthouse, disrupting active proceedings, and interferes with the official duties of an elected judge,\" she argued.",
      "The legal battles are separate from the political acrimony that has been fueled by the physical confrontations, including the handcuffing of Padilla last week \u2014 which the Department of Homeland Security claims happened after Padilla \"lunged toward\" Noem.",
      "In a tearful floor speech Tuesday, Padilla asked, \"How many Americans in the year 2025 see a vindictive president on a tour of retribution?\"",
      "As part of her statement to CBS News, the White House spokeswoman said, \"Democrats are disingenuously characterizing their behavior with the help of the Fake News media. And we look forward to CBS's coverage of Democrat smears against law enforcement officials, including comparing them to Nazis, leading to a 413% increase in assaults against ICE officers.\"",
      "As for Swalwell, he isn't the only congressional Democrat to seek out liability insurance to protect his legal future. According to a report last week by the NOTUS digital news outlet, multiple Democrats have done the same.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld a Tennessee law that restricts access to gender-affirming care for minors experiencing gender dysphoria, a decision that is likely to have broad implications for access to medical treatments for transgender youth in half of the country.",
      "In the case of U.S. v. Skrmetti, the high court ruled 6-3 to reject the challenge brought by the Biden administration, three families and a physician who had argued that Tennessee's law violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. The court concluded that the state's measure, which is known as SB1 and was enacted in 2023, does not run afoul of the 14th Amendment.",
      "\"Our role is not 'to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic' of the law before us, but only to ensure that it does not violate the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. Having concluded it does not, we leave questions regarding its policy to the people, their elected representatives, and the democratic process,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote.",
      "The court's majority found that Tennessee's law is not subject to a heightened level of judicial review and satisfies the most deferential standard, known as rational basis.",
      "\"We are asked to decide whether SB1 is subject to heightened scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause,\" Roberts wrote. \"We hold it is not. SB1 does not classify on the bases that warrant heightened review.\"",
      "The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, were in dissent. Sotomayor read her opinion from the bench, saying \"in sadness, I dissent.\"",
      "The court, Sotomayor wrote, \"obfuscates a sex classification that is plain on the face of this statute, all to avoid the mere possibility that a different court could strike down SB1, or categorical healthcare bans like it.\"",
      "Joined by Kagan and Jackson, she continued: \"The court's willingness to do so here does irrevocable damage to the Equal Protection Clause and invites legislatures to engage in discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight. It also authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them.\"",
      "The Tennessee law",
      "Tennessee's law prohibits medical treatments like puberty blockers or hormone therapy for transgender adolescents under the age of 18. The state is one of 25 with laws that seek to restrict access to gender-affirming care for young people diagnosed with gender dysphoria.",
      "The case, U.S. v. Skrmetti, marked the first in which the Supreme Court stepped into the politically charged debate over health care for transgender youth. In addition to the state prohibitions, President Trump has issued executive orders that address what he calls \"gender ideology.\" One declares that it is the federal government's policy to recognize \"two sexes, male and the female,\" and the second threatens federal funding for medical institutions that offer gender-affirming care to young people under the age of 18.",
      "Mr. Trump's proposals are being challenged in the federal courts.",
      "Known as SB1, Tennessee's law prevents health care providers from administering puberty blockers or hormone therapy if they're meant to enable \"a minor to identify with, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor's sex.\" The state had argued that it has a \"compelling interest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty,\" and in barring treatments that \"might encourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\"",
      "Shortly before the law took effect, three families with transgender children and a physician who provides the treatments to patients with gender dysphoria challenged the ban in federal court, arguing it is unconstitutional. The Biden administration then intervened in the case.",
      "A federal district court blocked the law, finding that it discriminates based on sex and transgender status. A divided panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit then reversed that decision and allowed Tennessee's ban to take effect while legal proceedings continued.",
      "The appeals court evaluated the law under rational-basis review, the most deferential of the tiers of judicial scrutiny. But the Biden administration and the families had argued Tennessee's ban should be subject to a more stringent level of review, known as heightened scrutiny, because it draws lines based on sex and discriminates based on transgender status.",
      "But Tennessee had argued that the state aims to protect young people from the consequences of the medical treatments, which it said are risky and unproven. The state said it was setting age- and use-based limits on medical care and exercising its authority to regulate medicine.",
      "Access to gender-affirming care has become a flashpoint in the culture wars, as half of the states have in recent years enacted laws that limit the availability of the medical interventions. Many of those same states have also enacted measures prohibiting transgender athletes from competing in women's sports.",
      "\"Today's landmark ruling by the Supreme Court is a victory for our Constitution, the rule of law, and common sense. Elected representatives have the right \u2014 and obligation \u2014 to protect children from falling victim to irreversible chemical and surgical mutilation,\" Liz Huston, White House spokesperson, said in a statement. \"President Trump will continue to speak out and take action to protect innocent American children from these barbaric procedures that are based on junk science.\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi cheered the Supreme Court's decision, which she said allows states to protect children.",
      "\"This Department of Justice will continue its fight to protect America's children and parental rights. I encourage other states to follow Tennessee's lead and enact similar legislation to protect our kids,\" she said in a statement shared on social media.",
      "The court's decision",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority found that Tennessee's law classifies on the basis of age and medical use, since treatments like puberty blockers and hormones can be administered to treat certain conditions, but not gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder or gender incongruence.",
      "Classifications that turn on age or medical use are subject only to rational-basis review, the least demanding level of judicial review, it said.",
      "\"Under SB1, no minor may be administered puberty blockers or hormones to treat gender dysphoria, gender identity disorder, or gender incongruence; minors of any sex may be administered puberty blockers or hormones for other purposes,\" Roberts wrote.",
      "The majority said that Tennessee had \"plausible reasons\" for restricting access to gender-affirming care that brought its inquiry over the law's constitutionality to an end, namely concerns about the health risks. The justices said they wouldn't second-guess the legislature over the lines that the ban draws.",
      "\"Recent developments only underscore the need for legislative flexibility in this area,\" Roberts wrote, pointing to a report from England's National Health Service that evaluated the evidence regarding the use of puberty blockers and hormones and characterized it as \"remarkably weak.\"",
      "\"This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field,\" he wrote. \"The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound. The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.\"",
      "Roberts concluded that the court's role is only to ensure that the law does not violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.",
      "Justices Clarence Thomas, Amy Coney Barrett and Samuel Alito all issued separate concurring opinions to express their views on the case.",
      "Thomas said the dispute serves as a reminder that the American people and their elected officials can disagree with experts on questions of \"controversial medical questions,\" and courts should not sit as a \"super-legislature.\"",
      "\"The ongoing debate over the efficacy of sex-transition treatments for children confirms that medical and regulatory authorities are not of one mind about the treatments' risks and benefits,\" he wrote. \"These conditions illustrate why states may rightly be skeptical of groups or advocates claiming that expert consensus supports their position, and why courts must exercise restraint in reviewing state legislatures' decisions in this area.\"",
      "Barrett, meanwhile, wrote that the question of how to regulate a medical condition like gender dysphoria involves policy judgments that legislatures, not courts, are best positioned to make. She noted that transgender status implicates other areas that have been subject to regulation by states, including access to restrooms and transgender athletes' eligibility for sports teams. If those laws are subject to a more stringent level of scrutiny, courts will then be forced to scrutinize those legislative choices, she warned.",
      "\"But legislatures have many valid reasons to make policy in these areas, and so long as a statute is a rational means of pursuing a legitimate end, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied,\" she wrote in a concurring opinion joined by Thomas.",
      "The dissent",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor wrote that Tennessee's law discriminates against transgender adolescents and conditions the availability of medications on the patient's sex. In subjecting the law to rational-basis review, Sotomayor accused the majority of \"retreating from meaningful judicial review exactly where it matters most\" and abandoning \"transgender children and their families to political whims.\"",
      "She said that the lower court should have evaluated the law under intermediate scrutiny because it draws lines on the basis of sex, and accused the majority of skirting its obligation to take a closer look at the ban.",
      "Sotomayor argued that there is a history of discrimination against transgender people in health care, employment and housing, and pointed to Mr. Trump's recent directives as evidence \u2014 namely his transgender military ban, which the Supreme Court allowed to take effect for now, and executive order seeking to ensure federal grant dollars do not promote what he calls \"gender ideology.\"",
      "She accused the majority of rendering \"transgender Americans doubly vulnerable to state-sanctioned discrimination,\" and said the high court could have ordered the 6th Circuit to apply the more stringent standard of review without wading into scientific and policy debates over the safety of medical treatments for minors experiencing gender dysphoria.",
      "\"Yet the majority inexplicably refuses to take even the modest step of requiring Tennessee to show its work before the lower courts,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "The ACLU and Lambda Legal, which represented the transgender adolescents and their families, lamented the Supreme Court's decision as a loss for transgender youth.",
      "\"Today's ruling is a devastating loss for transgender people, our families, and everyone who cares about the Constitution,\" said Chase Strangio, a co-director of the ACLU's LGBTQ & HIV Project who participated in arguments before the Supreme Court. \"Though this is a painful setback, it does not mean that transgender people and our allies are left with no options to defend our freedom, our health care, or our lives.\"",

    "summary": "Sen. Ted Cruz sparred with media personality Tucker Carlson, highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies over whether to join Israel's campaign against Iran.",
    "story": [
      "An interview between Tucker Carlson and Sen. Ted Cruz about Israel's military campaign against Iran became contentious when the ex-Fox News host quizzed the Texas Republican about Iran \u2014 highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies.",
      "The back-and-forth hinged on Cruz's backing of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets. The Trump administration has stated the U.S. is not directly involved in the offensive, but it has helped Israel defend against Iranian counterattacks, and Mr. Trump has weighed conducting strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Carlson \u2014 a vocal skeptic of military intervention \u2014 questioned the premise of joining a war with Iran and criticized Cruz for saying he would like the Iranian regime to be toppled, saying to Cruz at one point: \"You don't know anything about Iran.\"",
      "One of the most contentious exchanges in the two-hour interview \u2014 which was released in full on X Wednesday \u2014 came when Carlson asked Cruz what Iran's population is. Cruz said he wasn't sure.",
      "\"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\" Carlson asked.",
      "\"I don't sit around memorizing population tables,\" Cruz retorted.",
      "The host then followed up by asking Cruz about Iran's demographics. When Cruz said they were Persians, predominantly Shia Muslims, Carlson asked him for the percentage, frustrating the Texas senator.",
      "\"Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran,\" Cruz said.",
      "The two Trump supporters also argued about whether Iran has sought to assassinate Mr. Trump, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged last week. Federal prosecutors last year\u00a0announced charges against an Iranian asset, accusing him of plotting to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz cited the alleged assassination plots while criticizing Iran's leadership, but Carlson questioned why the senator hadn't instead supported immediate U.S. military action if he believed Iran has tried to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz, meanwhile, suggested Carlson at one point has a \"weird \u2026 obsession with Israel\" when Carlson asked about support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Carlson said he interpreted the comment as an accusation of antisemitism, which Cruz denied.",
      "\"You don't know anything about the country whose government you want to overthrow, and you're calling me reckless,\" Carlson said late in the interview.",
      "\"I want to stop a lunatic who wants to murder us from getting nuclear weapons that could kill millions of Americans. You say 'I can't see how that benefits America in any way.' That is bizarre,\" Cruz responded.",
      "The sparring continued on social media, with Cruz accusing Carlson of \"playing a 'gotcha' on the population of Iran\" and mocking the question about Iran's size.",
      "The bitter exchange reflects a wider divide among Mr. Trump's backers on how involved the U.S. should get in the Israel-Iran conflict. The president has long criticized foreign intervention, but has also supported pressuring Iran.",
      "Mr. Trump's closest advisers have not reached agreement on whether the president should strike Iranian nuclear facilities, CBS News has reported.",
      "Some Republicans, in addition to Cruz, have backed a hardline policy against Iran and are open to the U.S. joining Israel in striking Iran. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\u00a0told CBS News over the weekend he would prefer a diplomatic resolution to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but if that fails, he urged Mr. Trump \"to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program.\"",
      "During the interview, Cruz told Carlson he doesn't support sending U.S. troops into Iran, but told reporters Wednesday the president \"could quite reasonably make the decision\" to bomb Iran's subterranean nuclear site at\u00a0Fordo.",
      "But other Trump allies are wary of intervention. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told Carlson in an interview he views stopping \"forever wars\" as a core MAGA tenet, and suggested U.S. involvement in Iran could \"blow up the coalition\" and harm Mr. Trump's domestic priorities. Still, Bannon told reporters Wednesday he thinks \"the vast majority of the MAGA movement\" would trust Mr. Trump's judgment if he decides striking Iran is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, a handful of congressional Republicans have called for a resolution blocking Mr. Trump from taking military action on Iran without congressional approval.",
      "It's unclear how the president will proceed, though he downplayed the idea of an intra-MAGA rift over Iran on Wednesday, telling reporters, \"my supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them.\"",
      "The president also repeatedly lashed out at Carlson on Monday, before the Cruz interview was released. The president called him \"kooky\" in a Truth Social post, and seemed to mock Carlson over his ouster from Fox News.",
      "\"I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\"",

      "The steady exchange of fire has taken an escalating cost in human lives. Iranian authorities have provided no updates since saying over the weekend that more than 220 people were killed. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists in Iran organization, which relies on a network of contacts in the country, said Tuesday that it had documented at least 452 deaths in Iran since Israel launched its attacks, including 109 confirmed military personnel, 224 civilians and 119 people it could not immediately identify.",
      "The war has also sparked an exodus from Iran's capital Tehran with video showing thousands of vehicles at a near standstill on primary exit routes. Those frantic escape bids were fueled by Mr. Trump's direct warning to Tehran's roughly 10 million inhabitants earlier this week to \"evacuate immediately.\"",

The site is buried deep under a mountain, and Israel is thought to need U.S. warplanes to effectively strike the facility.",

    "summary": "About six years ago, Boelter was appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. But what exactly does being appointed to that board mean?",
    "story": [
      "Vance Boelter, 57, is in the Sherburne County Jail on Tuesday in Elk River, Minnesota, facing several federal and state charges for the shootings that killed a state representative and her husband, and wounded a state senator and his wife.",
      "Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot inside their Brooklyn Park home overnight Saturday. About 90 minutes before that, police say Boelter shot Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman\u00a0and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin. Both Hoffmans were struck multiple times and are still recovering.",
      "About six years ago, Boelter was appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. But what exactly does being appointed to that board mean?",
      "What we know about Boelter's appointment on workforce board",
      "State records show Boelter served two consecutive three-year terms on the development board, first appointed by\u00a0then-Gov. Mark Dayton in 2016. Three years later, Walz reappointed him.",
      "A spokesperson for Walz's office gave this statement to WCCO on Tuesday:",
      "\"There are thousands of volunteers of all political persuasions who serve on hundreds of these boards. That particular board has over 60 people on it. The Governor does not interview applicants for these roles and he does not know Boelter. They are not appointments to a position in the Governor's cabinet. These boards and commissions have no authority to make decisions, change laws, or implement policies.\"",
      "According to the development board's website, it \"represents key leaders from business, education, labor, community-based organizations, and government,\" with the board providing \"a venue for workforce stakeholders building on a shared vision and mission.\"",
      "Boelter's expertise was rooted in his work as a general manager at a Speedway gas station.",
      "During Boelter's second term, which ended in January 2023, he served alongside Sen. John Hoffman. It's unclear at this point if the two worked closely.",
      "David Schultz, political science professor at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, says under state law, the governor appoints hundreds of people to dozens of boards across the state, ranging in topics as disparate as amateur sports, mosquito control and tourism.",
      "Schultz says appointees are unpaid and the state's boards are more technical than political, with bipartisan appointments and, essentially, citizen volunteers. The governor's role, according to Schultz, is more ceremonial.",
      "\"They're not vetted or reviewed personally by the governor. In many cases, this is done as it should be, by subordinates, you know, who then bring to the governor the recommendations,\" Schultz said. \"And this is no different than what we would find in business and industry, where we don't expect the president of most companies to be involved in the hiring for every position.\"",
      "Schultz says people are oftentimes allowed to serve a couple of terms. Additionally, each board has different meeting requirements. Some meet just once a year, while others meet more frequently. And because these were statewide appointments, meetings often happened over Zoom, especially after the COVID pandemic.",
      "U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, who was previously lieutenant governor under Dayton and also served as his chief of staff, echoed Schultz that governors don't directly choose board appointments.",
      "\"Those workforce training councils or groups are very much not political, and the governor would often appoint people to those committees that they did not know personally, but were recommended by industry groups,\" she said in an interview with WCCO.",
      "FBI: Boelter extensively planned attacks, researched his victims",
      "The FBI says Boelter extensively planned and researched his victims. Inside his SUV left outside the Hortmans' home, police found high-powered guns and ammunition.",
      "They also found pages of handwritten notebooks with the names of more than 45 Minnesota state and federal public officials. Melissa Hortman's name was on that list, according to authorities, with her home address written next to her name.",
      "Boelter also visited the homes of two other lawmakers early Saturday. Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, confirmed on Tuesday that she was home, but Boelter was allegedly scared away after a police officer pulled up to his vehicle. Rest said she's grateful for the heroic work of the New Hope Police Department, whose \"quick action saved my life.\"",
      "Rep. Kristen Bahner, DFL-Maple Grove, confirmed on Wednesday she too had been targeted but was not at home, citing \"divine intervention\" that led her family to change their plans.",

      "Virginia's off-year elections typically draw national attention as a possible bellwether for politicians as they head into midterms in 2026. And this year, the election is also sure to make history.",
      "Spanberger, who ran for the Democratic nomination unopposed, will battle Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears in the governor's race. The female nominees all but guarantee that Virginia will have a woman for governor, which is a first in the state's some 250-year history dating back to Patrick Henry's governorship.",
      "On Wednesday, Spanberger's campaign announced a new advertisement emphasizing her biography.",
      "Conservatives did not hold statewide primaries this year, with only one candidate in each statewide contest advancing to the general election ballot.",

      "Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares sailed to his spot on the ballot after announcing his reelection bid.",
      "Roughly 481,000 votes have been counted so far in the lieutenant governor's Democratic primary, and about 479,000 in the contest for attorney general.",
      "The races appear to be on track to match Democratic turnout for the statewide primary in 2021. But in that election, a wide field of candidates vying for governor was on the ballot. With Spanberger as the nominee, only Hashmi and Jones faced contested statewide primaries.",
      "Hashmi's political career has been marked by its fair share of firsts: she was the first Muslim woman and the first South Asian American in Virginia's upper chamber.",
      "She emigrated from India to Georgia when she was four years old, later moving to Richmond after getting a doctorate in American literature. She spent most of her career as a professor, first at the University of Richmond and then at Reynolds Community College.",
      "The Democrat managed to distinguish herself by touting her legislative chops. Hashmi began her career in the Virginia Senate six years ago after ousting incumbent Republican Sen. Glen Sturtevant. She was reelected to her seat in 2023.",
      "In the Senate, Hashmi put forth bills establishing Virginians' right to contraception, which passed both chambers but were vetoed by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected a challenge brought by Texas and a group of landowners to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of a private company's plan to temporarily store thousands of metric tons of nuclear waste at a facility in the state.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote in a decision for a 6-3 court in the case of NRC v. Texas\t that neither Texas nor a land developer were parties to the commission's licensing proceeding, and therefore are not entitled to obtain judicial review. Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito dissented.",
      "The court reversed a decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit that allowed the case to move forward and ordered the lower court to deny or dismiss the petitions for review filed by Texas and the landowners. It did not address a second matter raised in the dispute regarding whether the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has the authority to license private companies to store nuclear waste offsite.",
      "\"In short, the Hobbs Act affords judicial review to those who were parties before the commission. Here, obtaining party status required Texas or Fasken to successfully intervene in the commission proceeding,\" Kavanaugh wrote for the six-justice majority. \"Because neither Texas nor Fasken successfully intervened, they may not obtain judicial review of the commission's licensing decision under the Hobbs Act.\"",
      "The Hobbs Act is a 1950 law that dictates when a \"party aggrieved\" by an agency's final order can seek review from a federal appeals court.",
      "How to address the problem of nuclear waste has been complicated by politics since the advent of nuclear power last century. In 1982, Congress enacted a law requiring the federal government to establish a permanent facility to store spent nuclear fuel. Yucca Mountain in Nevada was later selected to house this repository.",
      "But the site hasn't yet been established amid pushback from the state, and the project was halted during the Obama administration. It's unclear whether the Trump administration will seek to restart the Yucca Mountain project.",
      "The issue of where to put the increasing amount of spent fuel remains. More than 90,000 metric tons of nuclear waste from commercial power plants are currently privately stored, both at or away from nuclear reactor sites, according to the Government Accountability Office. Plants continue to generate an additional 2,000 metric tons of spent fuel each year, as nearly 20% of the nation's electricity is supplied by nuclear energy, according to the Department of Energy.",
      "Spent fuel from a nuclear reactor can remain radioactive and pose health risks for thousands of years,\u00a0according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "In September 2021, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission issued a license to a company called Interim Storage Partners that allowed it to store 5,000 metric tons, and up to 40,000 metric tons, of nuclear waste in dry-cask, above-ground storage for up to 40 years.",
      "The facility would be built in Andrews County, Texas, located west of Dallas and near the New Mexico border. The area is already home to a disposal site for low-level radioactive waste.",
      "Before the commission granted the license, the state submitted comments opposing the storage site and warned against housing spent nuclear fuel on a \"concrete pad\" above Texas' Permian Basin, where 250,000 active oil and gas wells capture 40% of the nation's oil reserves.",
      "Gov. Greg Abbott and the Texas Commission on Environmental Equality did not try to intervene during the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's proceedings. But other groups did try to object, including a company that owns land in the Permian Basin, though its request was denied by the commission.",
      "The state and landowners asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit to review the government's license to Interim Storage Partners, and the court allowed the legal battle to proceed. The 5th Circuit also ruled that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission did not have the authority to issue a license that let nuclear waste to be held at privately owned facilities offsite from where the spent fuel was generated.",
      "Whether the commission could allow private companies to temporarily store nuclear waste was only one part of the dispute before the Supreme Court. The first, key issue for the justices to weigh was whether Texas and landowners who challenged the license to Interim Storage Partners could do so in the first place, since they didn't intervene at an earlier stage in the licensing process.",
      "The high court determined that Texas and the landowners could not seek judicial review of the commission's decision to issue Interim Storage Partners its license. Still, Kavanaugh noted that \"history and precedent\" offer support for the commission's interpretation that the Atomic Energy Act allows spent nuclear fuel to be stored offsite at private facilities.",
      "\"To be clear, because Texas and Fasken's claims are not judicially reviewable, we need not and do not decide the ultimate question of statutory authority that the dissent focuses on,\" he wrote for the six-justice majority. \"So that there is no confusion, however, we underscore that in resting on the threshold reviewability issue, we are not somehow assuming or buying into a premise that the commission is wrong on the underlying merits.\"",
      "Writing in dissent, Gorsuch, joined by Thomas and Alito, said that the commission's decision to issue the license to Interim Storage Partners was unlawful. Accepting the commission's argument that Texas and Fasken could not seek review of its licensing decision \"requires us to ignore the full scope of the agency's own licensing proceeding,\" he wrote.",
      "Gorsuch continued: \"It forces us to reimagine a statute expanding public access to the agency's administrative proceedings into one restricting access. And it asks us to believe that the very state in which the agency intends to store spent nuclear fuel indefinitely cannot be heard in court to complain about the agency's plans. Because nothing in the law requires us to indulge any of those fantasies, I respectfully dissent. \"",

      "New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested Tuesday by masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents inside federal immigration court in Lower Manhattan.",
      "A U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Lander was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and\u00a0impeding a federal officer.",
      "He was released several hours later. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the charges against him were dropped.",
      "Lander's office said he was taken into custody by ICE agents while observing court. He has been attending immigration hearings for the past several weeks to observe and, by his own account, help escort people out of court so they aren't arrested by ICE.",
      "\"While escorting a defendant out of immigration court at 26 Federal Plaza, Brad was taken by masked agents and detained by ICE,\" Dora Pekec, Lander's campaign spokesperson, said in a statement.",
      "Video from the courthouse, shot by a member of Lander's staff, showed him being placed into handcuffs. A furious Lander could be heard telling agents that they had no right to cuff him.",
      "\"You don't have the authority to arrest U.S. citizens asking for a judicial warrant,\" he could be heard saying during his arrest.",
      "A spokesperson for the Southern District of New York said it is continuing to investigate the incident.",
      "\"The safety and security of official proceedings, government officials, law enforcement officers, and all members of the public who participate in them is a core focus of our office,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Under federal law, assaults on law enforcement or other public officials, destruction of property and obstruction of official proceedings are all prohibited.",
      "\"Our heroic ICE law enforcement officers face a 413% increase in assaults against them \u2014 it is wrong that politicians seeking higher office undermine law enforcement safety to get a viral moment. No one is above the law, and if you lay a hand on a law enforcement officer, you will face consequences,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said.",
      "Lander speaks out after ICE arrest",
      "\"I'm happy to report I am just fine. I lost a button,\" Lander joked after he was released. \"But I'm going to sleep in my bed tonight, safe with my family. I'm grateful to hear that the charges are not being brought. But if they are, I've got a lawyer. I don't have to worry about my due process rights. At that elevator, I was separated from someone named Edgardo, who I had just met a couple of minutes earlier. Edgardo is in ICE detention, and he's not going to sleep in his bed tonight. So far as I know, he has no lawyer. He has been stripped of his due process rights by a government and a judge that owe him a credible fear hearing before they deport him, and yet have decided instead to strip folks like Edgardo. So I will be fine, but Edgardo is not going to be fine, and the rule of law is not fine, and our constitutional democracy is not fine.\"",
      "Lander said he had accompanied four families out of prior hearings \"all of whom were afraid they were going to be detained by ICE agents.\"",
      "CBS News New York's Ali Bauman later asked Lander why he thinks he was arrested.",
      "\"Donald Trump is coming for New York City. He's coming for our immigration neighbors, trying to ratchet up fear. That's how creeping authoritarianism works,\" Lander said.",
      "\"It was important for me to go down there and stand up for... for the rule of law and due process in New York City,\" he added. \"And apparently, that is not what the Trump administration wants people to do.\"",
      "Lander's arrest followed the arrest of California Sen. Alex Padilla at a Homeland Security press conference last week, and the arrest of Newark Mayor Ras Baraka outside an ICE facility last month.",
      "Bauman asked Lander what message is being sent when people see politicians arrested.",
      "\"[Attorney General] Pam Bondi has made it clear what they're doing. They're going after the leaders of Democratic cities with a political intention of provoking conflict,\" Lander said.",
      "Hochul calls it a \"sorry day for New York and for our country\"",
      "The governor also spoke out after Lander was released.",
      "\"This is a sorry day for New York and our country,\" Hochul said. \"The video is shocking. I knew I needed to come down here immediately [to] check on [his] whereabouts and do what I could to intervene.\"",
      "Hochul went on to say, \"We're a better country than this. A far better country than what we're experiencing. This is New York. This is New York, a land of immigrants. We're proud of them. As I stood in the hallway upstairs on the ninth floor waiting to know the whereabouts of my friend, almost everyone I spoke to who worked there in security and otherwise, they came from other countries. They're immigrants, themselves. Don't forget that.\"",
      "A spokesperson for New York City Mayor Eric Adams said in a statement, \"Today should not be about Brad Lander.\"",
      "\"It's about making sure all New Yorkers \u2014 regardless of their documentation status \u2014 feel safe enough to use public resources, like dialing 911, sending their kids to school, going to the hospital, or attending court appearances, and do not instead hide in the shadows,\" the statement continued.",
      "\"ICE arresting Brad Lander for asking questions is a stunning abuse of power and a threat to our democracy. Arresting a public official, the duly-elected comptroller of the City of New York, for asking questions is dangerous intimidation and shows a wanton disregard for the will of the people of New York. It sends an unmistakably authoritarian message \u2014 that ICE doesn't care about the rule of law and that anyone exercising their right to challenge ICE and speak up for immigrants will be punished,\" ACLU of New York Executive Director Donna Lieberman said. \"All elected officials and candidates for office should condemn this arrest in the strongest terms and stand up for New Yorkers.\"",
      "\"This is an abomination. The violence that you witness from a sitting citywide official who's simply standing to bear witness [to] what is happening to other humans, that violence you saw him experience, just imagine what they do to people who are less well known,\" said New York City Councilmember Alex Avil\u00e9s.",
      "\"What I saw today was not the rule of law,\" Lander's wife says",
      "Lander's wife, Meg Barnette, held an earlier news conference outside the courthouse, saying she was with him when he was arrested.",
      "\"I joined him today, because this is the third time that he has done court watching here, and I have been moved and horrified and found his stories very compelling, and I wanted to be here with him to witness for myself,\" Barnette said. \"What I saw was shocking and unacceptable and not in accordance \u2014 I am an attorney. I haven't practiced law in a while, but I sure know that what I saw today was not the rule of law. That was not due process, and the way people are being treated is absolutely unacceptable in this city and this country.\"",
      "She told reporters Lander and other advocates had repeatedly asked to see the judicial warrant and grounds for deportation and they were linking arms with the person at the center of the hearing, whom he later identified as Edgardo.",
      "\"We're surrounding the individual, locking arms. We asked \u2014 I was part of the group \u2014 and we asked numerous times for the warrant, for their names, for their badge numbers. It was unclear what agency they were from, they're in full uniform, in many cases, with a mask pulled up over the bridge of their nose,\" said Barnette. \"So Brad, I assume, was saying, 'I am an American citizen, I am asking you for the judicial warrant, you do not have grounds to arrest me.'\"",
      "Lander has been going to immigration court on separate occasions for several weeks after a number of undocumented immigrants, including a Bronx public school student named Dylan, were arrested by masked ICE agents after showing up to routine hearings.",
      "Public Advocate Jumaane Williams joined the news conference and said, \"Thank you to Brad Lander.\"",
      "\"Sometimes, all the power we have is to be present and to witness what is happening. And everyone of any moral character, any moral consciousness will be thanking Brad Lander for being that witness and using what he could where he was with what he had to try to help someone,\" Williams said. \"What is happening in this country, what is happening in that building is simply unacceptable.\"",
      "Lander's rabbi was also at the courthouse as an observer and spoke during the news conference.",
      "\"I share the public advocate's view that I have never been as proud of him as I am today, and I've known him in many situations,\" said Rabbi Ellen Lippmann. \"I have never been as ashamed to be an American or a New Yorker as I feel today, except for the uprising from all the incredible New Yorkers who represent the good and the true and the right in this city.\"",
      "What advocates allege is happening in immigration court",
      "Barnette described seeing multiple cases where the person is told that their case is dismissed and they have 30 days to appeal, but said they were then met by agents waiting for them in the hallway.",
      "\"What I saw happen, repeatedly, there and what I understand from other stories has continued to happen is that these folks have pending asylum cases, they are told, 'Your case is dismissed.' That sounds like good news. It is not good news. What that means is that you are subject to immediate removal when you leave the courtroom,\" she explained. \"And the ICE agents are lining the hallway, and that is not explained to people.\"",
      "\"They are kidnapping our neighbors off of the street. They are bamboozling them, they are tricking them to tell them to come here and something good will happen. And when they hear the court news, they believe something good has happened. And then they're faced with people in fatigues, with masks on their faces, and they're taken, having not understood even what just happened legally and what their recourse is,\" added Williams. \"That is something that we all have to stand up against.\"",

      "The Trump administration has lifted a short-lived pause on immigration arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants, reversing a major policy pivot just a few days after issuing it internally, two sources familiar with the latest guidance told CBS News.",
      "One of the sources said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials were told they could continue carrying out worksite enforcement operations to arrest unauthorized immigrants at farms, hotels and restaurants, as long as they are targeted in nature.",
      "The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said ICE officials were informed of the new guidance during a call Monday.",
      "In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said, \"The President has been incredibly clear. There will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "\"Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security and economic stability,\" McLaughlin added. \"These operations target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\"",
      "Last week, ICE officials were directed to suspend worksite enforcement operations targeting farms, hotels and restaurants, amid growing concerns among industry leaders that President Trump's aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration was spooking their foreign-born workers, many of whom are in the country illegally or on temporary humanitarian programs his administration has sought to curtail.",
      "Mr. Trump himself last week recognized how U.S. farmers and hotel operators rely on immigrant employees, and appeared to preview an upcoming order to protect these industries.",
      "\"We can't take farmers and take all their people and send them back because they don't have, maybe, what they're supposed to have, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said, adding later, \"We can't do that to our farmers. And leisure, too. Hotels. We're going to have to use a lot of common sense on that.\"",
      "Still, last week's scaling back of worksite immigration enforcement was, in many ways, at odds with the Trump administration's vow to deport millions of immigrants living in the U.S. unlawfully. Two of his top immigration advisers, Stephen Miller and Tom Homan, have both talked about increasing immigration arrests at worksites to fulfill the administration's mass deportation plans.",
      "Last week, ICE arrested more than 70 migrants at a meat processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, as part of an operation that the agency touted as the largest of its kind in that state.",
      "Daily ICE arrests have increased in recent weeks, from an average of 660 in Mr. Trump's first 100 days in office to 1,200 in June, due in large part to enhanced operations in major cities like Los Angeles supported by other federal agencies, like the FBI and Customs and Border Protection. But they remain far below the 3,000 daily arrest rate pushed by the White House.",

      "An Afghan ally who served alongside U.S. forces was legally paroled into the U.S. and showed up for his first hearing.@DHSGov detained him anyway\u2014using a vague \u201cimprovidently issued\u201d excuse.He followed the rules.We have the video.This must stop.#AfghanEvac #DueProcess pic.twitter.com/zZXjzQUDMT",
      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said Shawn VanDiver, executive director for #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. wartime allies. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "The Department for Homeland Security and ICE did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to, and DHS did not respond to our request for more information.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

      "\"The ideologically motivated directives to terminate grants alleged to constitute DEI, 'gender ideology,' or other forbidden topics were, in fact, arbitrary and capricious, and have now been ruled unlawful,\" Dr. Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement Tuesday. Lurie's group was among those that filed the lawsuit.",

      "\"HHS is exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal and moving to stay the order,\" Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.",
      "Nixon said the department \"stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,\" saying the department wanted taxpayer dollars to support \"gold standard science\" and not \"divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology.\"",
      "The court has not yet published Young's order in the case, but notes from the clerk announced that the challenged directives have been vacated and that the Trump administration was ordered to \"promptly comply.\"",
      "Separate court cases are underway for other cuts to medical research funding sought by the Trump administration, like the terminations of funding to universities like Harvard and Columbia that have disrupted studies for cancer and diseases.",

      "Young's ruling came after opponents challenged the process used by the Trump administration to come up with and implement its steep cuts to grants, saying the law requires federal agencies changing their policies to \"supply a reasoned analysis for the change.\"",
      "Flaws cited by a trial brief brought by the groups included the lack of a definition for what qualified as banned \"DEI studies\" and NIH Acting Director Dr. Matthew Memoli having spent only minutes deciding which grants and funding opportunities to cut.",

      "In a Truth Social post, the president called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials \"to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.\" He added that to reach the goal officials \"must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.\"",
      "\"These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,\" the president wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump's declaration comes after weeks of increased enforcement, and after Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of the president's immigration policies, said ICE officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration has directed ICE to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's\u00a0crackdown\u00a0on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News.

      "Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing, sending flaming debris shooting away into the overnight sky from a churning fireball that engulfed the test stand.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first near the rocket's nose followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred.

      "NASA captured an image of an intense solar flare released by the sun on Tuesday evening.",
      "The solar flare peaked at 5:49 p.m. EDT on Tuesday, NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory said. It was an X-class flare \u2014 the most intense kind, NASA said. Solar flares are essentially \"giant explosions on the sun\" that send energy, light and high-speed particles into space, according to NASA.",
      "An image captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory shows the sun, colorized in teal to draw attention to the flare. The flare is visible as a bright flash at the center of the sun. The heat of a solar flare causes it to appear bright.",
      "The energy from solar flares can be disruptive, NASA says on its website. Flares and solar eruptions can impact radio communications, electric power grids and navigation signals. They also can pose risks to spacecraft and astronauts.",
      "Solar flares are also often associated with coronal mass ejections, or CMEs. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says online. Often, CMEs look like \"huge, twisted ropes,\" NASA says, because they involve the sun's magnetic fields. Coronal mass ejections can also disrupt radio and satellite communications, and can also cause geomagnetic storms on Earth.",
      "In May 2024, a powerful coronal mass ejection brought the strongest geomagnetic storm in over 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares were recorded. The storm caused some radio blackouts. Another strong geomagnetic storm in October 2024\u00a0led to the northern lights being visible as far south as Florida and over bright areas like New York City and Chicago.",

      "If that schedule holds up, commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu would aim for a docking at the space-facing port of the station's Harmony module around 10:30 a.m. on Friday.",
      "The flight originally was planned for last Tuesday but it was repeatedly delayed, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by troubleshooting to find an oxygen leak in the first stage of the crew's Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "While SpaceX worked to resolve the oxygen propellant leak, NASA managers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to stop or minimize air leaks in a Russian vestibule, known as the PrK, that serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019 and up to now, efforts to seal them off have been unsuccessful. But on Friday, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, reported cosmonauts aboard the station had successfully eliminated the leaks in the PrK.",
      "\"Following the most recent repair, pressure in the transfer tunnel has been stable,\" NASA confirmed in a blog post Saturday. \"This could indicate the small leaks have been sealed.\"",
      "The leak rates seen earlier could be related to \"a small amount of air flowing into the transfer tunnel across the hatch seal from the main part of the station,\" NASA said.",

    "summary": "Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon, said he expects the company to reduce its workforce over the next few years as it rolls out more generative AI and agents.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon's CEO envisions an \"agentic future\" in which AI robots, or agents, replace humans working in the company's offices.",
      "In a\u00a0memo\u00a0to employees made public by Amazon on Tuesday, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects the company to reduce its corporate workforce in as soon as the next few years, as it leans more heavily on generative AI tools to help fulfill workplace duties.",
      "\"As we roll out more generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done,\" Jassy stated. \"We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs.\"",
      "Jassy added that this move toward AI would eventually \"reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\" With approximately 1.5 million employees worldwide, the e-commerce giant is the second largest private employer in the United States.",
      "Reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson deferred to the original memo.",
      "Amazon shares dipped slightly on Tuesday, down 0.4% as of 3:45 p.m. EST.",
      "Amazon investing \"quite expansively\" in AI",
      "Amazon is \"investing quite expansively\" in generative AI technology, according to Jassy, adding that \"the progress we are making is evident.\"",
      "\"Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast,\" the CEO stated in the memo.",
      "Amazon ramped up its participation in the generative AI arms race with the release of the Amazon Echo smart speaker in 2014, its first product to include its virtual assistant Alexa. This February, the company\u00a0announced it was unveiling Alexa+, a new version of the AI-powered voice assistant that's \"more conversational, smarter, personalized.\"",
      "AI features have since been incorporated across Amazon's e-commerce websites through tools like \"Buy for Me\" which allow customers to ask a shopping assistant to buy an item for them and \"Recommended Size\" which predicts your clothing size based on past purchases. Amazon's\u00a0AI shopping assistant is used by tens of millions of customers, according to Jassy.",
      "AI replaces creativity for some",
      "In the Tuesday memo, Jassy sketched out a future in which AI agents are used to conduct tedious tasks, freeing up human workers to take on more creative roles.",
      "\"Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point,\" Jassy said. \"We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones.\"",
      "However, this hard-pivot into AI has generated negative feedback from some white-collar employees at the company. Amazon software engineers interviewed recently by the New York Times\u00a0describe\u00a0an intensified work environment in which they are pushed to use AI to increase productivity and meet higher output goals, making their jobs \"more routine, less thoughtful and, crucially, much faster paced.\"",
      "All told, Amazon currently has 1,000 generative AI services and applications either in the works or already built, a \"small fraction\" of what the company ultimately plans to build, said Jassy.",
      "Jassy's pledge to invest in AI comes after the company announced in May that it would cut 100 jobs in its devices and services\u00a0unit, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration keeps delaying enforcement of a bipartisan law that requires TikTok and ByteDance to fully sever ties.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has once again delayed the enforcement of a bipartisan law that would effectively ban TikTok in the U.S. as a deal to separate TikTok from its China-based parent company, ByteDance, has remained elusive.",
      "The president announced Thursday that he signed an executive order pushing back the deadline for enforcing a law passed by Congress until mid-September \u2014 the third delay in the law's implementation since his inauguration in January. The previous extension expired Thursday. Citing national security concerns, Congress passed the law last year with bipartisan support giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to fully sever ties with TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and web-hosting services.",
      "\"I've just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025),\" the president wrote on Truth Social Thursday. \"Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "The orders have directed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failure to remove the widely popular video-sharing app from their platforms.",
      "TikTok released a statement thanking the president for the extension.",
      "\"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's office,\" the TikTok statement said.",
      "White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said earlier this week that the president would sign the executive order delaying enforcement of the law for 90 days.",
      "\"As he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the Administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\" Leavitt said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced the last extension in early April, his administration had reached an agreement that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, a source familiar with the plans said at the time. But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "However, ByteDance said after the April announcement that a deal had not been reached because there were still key issues to be resolved, and noted that any deal would be subject to the Chinese government's approval.",
      "Mr. Trump acknowledged as much in May, telling reporters that \"we'll probably have to get China's approval.\"",
      "\"China's never easy,\" he said. \"I'd like to save TikTok. I mean, TikTok was very good to me.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump expressed confidence that China would sign off on an eventual deal, saying that \"I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\"",
      "The president also reiterated his support for TikTok on June 12, touting his popularity on the app that he unsuccessfully tried to ban during his first term.",
      "\"I was No. 1 on TikTok in its history. Can you believe that?\" Mr. Trump claimed. \"So I guess I like TikTok.\"",
      "Mr. Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier this month in a 90-minute conversation that the U.S. leader said \"was focused almost entirely on trade.\" Neither countries' summaries of the call mentioned TikTok. Days later, senior U.S. and Chinese trade representatives met in London and reached a \"framework deal\" to ease the trade war.",
      "Testifying to the Senate Finance Committee on June 12 after the trade talks, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said TikTok \"was not discussed at the meetings in London.\"",
      "\"I have no visibility into TikTok,\" he told the committee.",
      "TikTok briefly and voluntarily shut down before a January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action.

    "summary": "Unauthorized immigrants make up nearly 5% of the U.S. workforce, according to 2022 estimates, and a higher share in construction and agriculture.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u00a0resumed\u00a0more aggressive workplace immigration enforcement earlier this week after briefly pausing arrests at farms, hotels and restaurants last week.",
      "\"The message is clear now that we're going to continue doing worksite enforcement operations, even on farms and hotels, but based on a prioritized basis,\" President Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, said Thursday, adding, \"Criminals come first.\"",
      "The White House argues that undocumented workers drive down wages and take jobs from American-born workers. But some farming and hospitality industry leaders have warned the administration that large-scale deportations could disrupt operations, as many of these workers fill essential jobs that are difficult to replace with domestic labor.",
      "Undocumented immigrants make up a sizable slice of the workforce in not only hospitality and farming but also construction and manufacturing.",
      "Additionally, undocumented workers are spread across the U.S., including in blue states like California and New Jersey, and in states that supported Mr. Trump in the 2024 election, like Texas, Florida, and Nevada, which have some of the biggest shares of unauthorized workers.",
      "Here's a closer look at the industries most dependent on undocumented workers and the states where these workers are concentrated.",
      "Undocumented workers in key industries",
      "The Center for Immigration Studies estimated in 2024 that there are about 14 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S.",
      "The most recent detailed breakdown by sector and state comes from the Pew Research Center's analysis of Census data from 2022. According to that study, there were an estimated 8.3 million undocumented immigrants who were part of the workforce, out of 11 million total in the country at that time.",
      "These workers made up 4.8% of the overall U.S. workforce, according to Pew, but they were a much larger share of the workforce in several essential industries.",
      "Nearly 1 in 5\u00a0 household workers and landscapers, 16% of crop workers and meat processors, 14% of apparel manufacturing workers and 13% of construction workers were undocumented immigrants, Pew estimated.",
      "The numbers were even higher depending on the occupation. One-third of roofers and workers who install drywall and ceiling tiles were undocumented, as were a quarter of maids and housekeepers, and nearly one-fifth of brickmasons.",
      "Because the U.S. Census does not directly ask about legal status, the number of unauthorized immigrants and their participation in the workforce is inexact. Pew Research Center analyzed the American Community Survey from 2022, and Goldman Sachs produced similar estimates based on the 2023 version of the survey.",
      "The share of undocumented workers in a given industry may be even higher than estimates based on the Census. A survey by the Department of Agriculture from 2021 to 2022 found that 42% of 2,600 crop workers interviewed did not have work authorization.",
      "Industry leaders have said the renewed deportation push is making it harder to operate. American Farm Bureau Federation president Zippy Duvall expressed disappointment on Tuesday in the administration's decision to restart immigration arrests on farms, forecasting that it could lead to inflated food prices for American consumers.",
      "\"Unfortunately, domestic workers do not apply for farm jobs, despite aggressive hiring efforts. Without farm workers, vegetables will be left in the fields, fruit will remain unpicked, and cows will go unmilked. The end result is a reduced food supply and higher grocery prices for all of America's families,\" Duvall said in a statement.",
      "Research also indicates that deportation can actually lead to fewer jobs for native-born workers. One study of the Obama administration's Secure Communities program, which deported nearly half a million undocumented immigrants, estimated that for every 1 million people deported, the number of jobs held by U.S.-born people would be reduced by 88,000.",
      "\"You can think about foreign-born workers taking jobs like a construction worker or a dishwasher at a local restaurant, and then once people are in those jobs employers are also able to hire construction managers and waiters and waitresses. And those are jobs typically taken by U.S.-born workers,\" economist Chloe East, the study's author, told CBS News.",
      "Researchers at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, estimate that if all of the unauthorized workers in the country were deported, U.S. GDP could fall as much as 7.4% below baseline by 2028.",
      "Share of undocumented workers by state",
      "President Trump said in a recent post on social media that his administration would focus on deportation efforts in Democrat-led cities like Los Angeles, Chicago and New York, which he characterized as the places where \"millions upon millions of illegal aliens reside.\"",
      "But research indicates the undocumented population is spread across the country in both blue- and red-leaning states.",
      "Unauthorized immigrants make up the greatest share of both the population and workforce in Nevada and Texas \u2014 two states Mr. Trump won in 2024 \u2014 where the Pew Research Center estimates over 8% of workers were undocumented as of 2022.",
      "In California, where immigration enforcement raids sparked protests last week, Pew estimated that as of 2022, 7.2% of the workforce was undocumented. In New York, the figure was about 5%.",
      "Texas Restaurant Association CEO and president Emily Williams Knight told CBS News that some restaurants in the state are experiencing staffing issues because workers are afraid to come to work amid the crackdown.",
      "\"You have to remember, if people stop going to work in restaurants, that means restaurants can't serve their community. That means the dollar that restaurants put into each community, for a dollar spent, goes away, and then those workers are also not spending,\" Knight said.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"While the President remains focused on immediately removing dangerous criminal illegal aliens from the country, including those given safe harbor in Democrat-run sanctuary cities, anyone who is here illegally is liable to be deported.\"",
      "Jackson added, \"Any suggestion that enforcing immigration law will hurt the workforce misses the forest for the trees \u2014 there is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force.\"",

    "summary": "Juneteenth became federally recognized in the U.S. in 2021, but the origins of the holiday and its name date back more than 150 years.",
    "story": [
      "June 19, 2025, marks the fifth consecutive year that Juneteenth is a federally recognized United States holiday. Also known as\u00a0Freedom Day, Emancipation Day or America's second Independence Day, Juneteenth commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. after the Civil War.",
      "Many Americans have celebrated it annually for more than a century, even though the holiday was not officially added to the national calendar until 2021. As the\u00a0Black Lives Matter movement gained renewed power across the country in 2020 with the police killings of Black Americans like George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, public calls grew louder for the federal government to acknowledge emancipation as the critical turning point it was in U.S. history. Advocates sought, again, for leaders to codify the Juneteenth holiday into law, decades after communities began to push for broader recognition of Juneteenth as an emblem of unity, power and resilience in the wake of the police beating of Rodney King in 1991.",
      "Federal recognition came in 2021. A bill to solidify Juneteenth National Independence Day as a legal public holiday passed almost unanimously through both chambers of Congress before being signed by then-President Biden that June. At a White House ceremony held for the occasion, Mr. Biden said: \"All Americans can feel the power of this day, and learn from our history.\" It was the first time a national holiday was established in the U.S. since Martin Luther King Jr. Day was set to honor the late civil rights leader's birthday in 1983.",
      "Once Juneteenth became a legal federal holiday, it is observed and celebrated each year on June 19. Some upcoming celebrations for the 2025 holiday are expected to be smaller than they were in years past, as corporate sponsors taper their support for Juneteenth events amid wider political efforts to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Pride Month sponsorships have followed a similar pattern.",
      "Despite any funding changes, Juneteenth festivities are still set to draw crowds across the country. And communities in a number of places have been celebrating for much longer than that: New York City kicked off its 16th annual Juneteenth festival last weekend with a parade across Brooklyn, and will host a range of activities through June 19.",
      "The origins of Juneteenth",
      "The name Juneteenth is a portmanteau that combines the words June and nineteenth. Its origins date back to June 19, 1865, when the last group of people enslaved in the southern U.S. were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. President Abraham Lincoln had signed the Emancipation Proclamation more than two years earlier, on Jan. 1, 1863, declaring that everyone held as a slave was, and would continue to be, free.",
      "The proclamation took effect as the country neared its second year of the Civil War and technically applied to enslaved people in Confederate states. However, it could not actually be implemented in Confederate territory, and the war would not end in victory for the Union Army until much later, in the spring of 1865. In Texas, the westernmost state controlled by the Confederacy, news of freedom and the tenets of the Emancipation Proclamation arrived that summer. On June 19, thousands of Union soldiers reached Galveston Bay, along the northeastern coast of Texas in the Gulf of Mexico, and announced that all enslaved people in the state were freed by executive order.",
      "At the time, more than 250,000 Black people were being held as slaves in Texas alone, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which writes in a description of the holiday that the \"historical legacy of Juneteenth shows the value of never giving up hope in uncertain times.\" Once the Emancipation Proclamation laid its roots in Texas, those freed from slavery declared the day of its arrival \"Juneteenth\" in homage to the date when it finally happened.",
      "Although the Emancipation Proclamation set the stage, critically, for an end to slavery throughout the U.S., it was the 13th Amendment to the Constitution that actually did it. The amendment's passage through Congress and across Lincoln's desk began in January 1865. It was ratified in December of that year, abolishing slavery nationwide.",
      "How to celebrate Juneteenth",
      "Observing Juneteenth each year on June 19 does memorialize that specific day in Galveston in 1865, but it is also symbolic. Many regard the holiday as a joyful anniversary of independence and an opportunity to remember the country's foundation on centuries of slavery.",
      "Historically, communities in different parts of the U.S. have celebrated Emancipation Day on different dates, a tradition that nodded to the fact that news of the Emancipation Proclamation reached people enslaved by the Confederacy at different times after the Civil War. In Florida, for example, advocates in 2021 pushed for the state to recognize and observe Emancipation Day on May 20, because that was the date in 1865 when news of Lincoln's executive decree reached enslaved people there. Washington, D.C., has in the past observed a city-wide Emancipation Day on April 16.",
      "Juneteenth celebrations vary. Public festivities often include parades, parties, concerts, educational workshops and other cultural events centered on art and cuisine. For some, commemorating Juneteenth is mainly about tapping into the spirit of the holiday. Koritha Mitchell, an English professor at Ohio State University who celebrated Juneteenth growing up in a small town outside of Houston, told CBS News in 2021 that, for her, the day revolved around family and \"creating community and connection.\"",
      "Opal Lee, the retired teacher and counselor whose activism played a huge role in Juneteenth becoming a federally recognized holiday, recalled joyful memories of the annual celebrations in the Texas town where she lived as a child.",
      "\"When I was a little one and we lived in Marshall, Texas, we'd go to the fairground,\" she said in a\u00a0CBS News interview\u00a0in 2022. \"There'd be games and food and food and food. I'm here to tell ya, it was like Christmas!\"",
      "Lee, now 98, became known as the \"Grandmother of Juneteenth\" for her famous trek from Fort Worth, Texas, to Washington, D.C., to ultimately deliver 1.5 million signatures to Congress advocating for a law to make the date a federal holiday. She shared her thoughts on the essence of Juneteenth in that 2022 interview.",
      "\"People think it's a Black thing when it's not. It's not a Texas thing. It's not that,\" Lee said. \"Juneteenth means freedom, and I mean for everybody!\"",
      "Unlike previous years, Lee will not lead this year's Walk for Freedom in Fort Worth after being hospitalized in May, CBS News Texas reported. Her granddaughter, Dione Sims, told the station that she will lead the walk in her grandmother's place, \"carrying on her legacy.\"",

      "Read was found not guilty\u00a0of second-degree murder, manslaughter while operating under the influence of alcohol, and leaving the scene of bodily injury in O'Keefe's death in Canton, Massachusetts.

      "\"One of things that people don't understand until they get in it on a jury is what that means. If you think someone's guilty, if you guess they're guilty, you suspect they're guilty, but you don't have a conviction to a moral certainty, you must acquit. Doesn't mean a person is innocent. Just means the Commonwealth didn't prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\"",
      "Karen Read trial experts \"cancel each other out\"",
      "Both the prosecution and Read's attorneys presented experts to bolster their cases, and described very different versions of events.",
      "Prosecutor Hank Brennan said Read \"was drunk, she hit him, then she left him to die.\" Read's attorney Alan Jackson told the court, \"There was no collision,\" and that \"There is no evidence that John was hit by a car. None. How much more reasonable doubt could there be?\"",
      "\"It depends on which expert you believe,\" Klieman said of the jury. \"You had Commonwealth experts who had one theory, and you had very good defense experts who had the opposite theory. And the defense expert said that car, Karen Read's car, never hit John O'Keefe. They cancel each other out as experts. And if that isn't doubt, I don't know what is.\"",
      "Klieman also highlighted the role of lead investigator\u00a0Michael Proctor, who was fired by Massachusetts State Police for his conduct while handling Read's case.",
      "\"He was someone who also supervised one of the most sloppy police investigations of all time,\" she said.",
      "Karen Read attorneys had \"dress rehearsal\" advantage",

      "\"In this case, the defense clearly had an advantage because they had had a dress rehearsal. They knew what their weak points were,\" Klieman said.",
      "\"Alan Jackson is one of the best criminal defense lawyers in the country. And Hank Brennan is also right up there as a defense lawyer. He was appointed as special prosecutor. So, for a student of the law, if you can take emotion out of it, to watch them work was a thing of real beauty and it could teach young lawyers how to try cases.\"",

Klieman said the civil case will feature a much lighter burden of proof than the criminal trial.",
      "\"First of all, we have to remember that someone died here who was a very decent human being by all accounts,\" Klieman said. \"The civil case is in a civil court, it's in a different courthouse, different burden of proof, proof to [standard of] 'a preponderance of evidence.' As I always say, that's like a feather on the scale, whereas proof beyond a reasonable doubt, you need like a lead balloon. And so is there a great chance that they will prevail \u2014 that is, the family \u2014 in the civil court? Yes, they have a great chance.

      "As Israel and Iran continued trading missile strikes, some U.S. citizens have begun making plans to evacuate Israel \u2014 and for many young people on tours or studying, it has been bittersweet.",
      "Some, like University of Michigan junior Julia Cohen, had arrived in May with hundreds of other college students to participate in the Birthright Onward program, which provides internships and fellowships in Israel to people of Jewish descent. She had been dreaming of studying in Israel for years and, after much consideration, her parents decided to support their daughter's decision in April.",
      "Cohen recently found herself staying at a hotel in Southern Israel after nights of Iran and Israel exchanging missiles, her mother told CBS News from New York.",
      "\"They were running back and forth to bomb shelters in Tel Aviv,\" said Marnie Cohen, who had booked return flights for her daughter to Barcelona, then onward to the United States.",
      "As of Wednesday, at least 24 people have been killed by Iranian missiles that slipped through Israel's robust air defenses, according to Israeli officials. The U.S.-based Human Rights Activists in Iran organization, which relies on a network of contacts in the country, said Tuesday that it had documented at least 452 deaths in Iran since Israel launched its attacks.",

      "\"We will alert the U.S. citizen community if there is additional information to share regarding departure options,\" the embassy said in an email message to Americans who had enrolled in the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP).",
      "\"If the U.S. government provides departure assistance from Israel, options would most likely include travel to a nearby, safe country,\" and not travel all the way back to the U.S., the embassy said. It asked Americans in Israel interested in leaving the country to fill out an online form.",
      "After Israel's airspace closed, Birthright Onward moved around 300-400 students out of Tel Aviv, and parents started to explore alternatives to get their children out of the country, Marnie Cohen said. It is not clear how many students are currently in Israel.",
      "Birthright aims to bring 50,000 Jewish young adults, a portion of whom attend the Onward program, to Israel every year.

      "Cohen said her daughter's roommate exited through Jordan, taking a car to the capital of Amman and flying from there to the United States.

    "summary": "A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during ramp-up to an expected engine test firing at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast. It's an apparent major setback for the program.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded in a spectacular conflagration during ramp-up to an expected engine test firing at the company's Starbase manufacturing facility on the Texas Gulf Coast late Wednesday, destroying the rocket in what appears to be a major setback for the Super Heavy-Starship vehicle Elon Musk says is critical to the company's future.",
      "Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing, sending flaming debris shooting away into the overnight sky from a churning fireball that engulfed the test stand.",
      "The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first near the rocket's nose followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast.",
      "The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires appeared to still be burning out of control at what is known as the Massey test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfire tests are typically conducted.",
      "\"On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,\" SpaceX said in a statement on the social media platform X. \"A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials.",
      "\"There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area.\"",
      "The explosion's impact on the test site infrastructure was not immediately known. SpaceX has a history of making relatively quick recoveries from failures or setbacks but this mishap, along with destroying a nearly-ready-to-launch Starship, may have caused significant damage to Starbase infrastructure. In any case, the next test flight will be indefinitely delayed.",
      "Known as Ship 36, SpaceX was expected to launch the Starship atop a huge Super Heavy booster around the end of the month on the integrated rocket's tenth unpiloted test fight. Hotfire tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing it to launch.",
      "SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages.",
      "The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were partially successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. The third, most recent flight on May 27 reached its planned trajectory but spun out of control and broke up during atmospheric entry.",
      "NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant carrying astronauts to a landing near the moon's south pole in the next two or three years.",
      "To get the Human Landing System \u2014 HLS \u2014 Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starships to refuel the lander in low-Earth orbit before it can head for the moon to await the arrival of the astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule.",
      "Given the complexity of the architecture, the need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, perfect the autonomous transfer of super cold propellants and new technology to keep the cryogenic liquid methane and oxygen from warming up and boiling away in space, failures like Wednesday's will make the schedule all the tougher to meet.",

      "According to the USDA, the New World Screwworm \"is a devastating pest.\" The scientific name for the parasite, Cochliomyia hominivorax, is roughly translated to \"man-eater,\" according to the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.",
      "\"When NWS fly larvae (maggots) burrow into the flesh of a living animal, they cause serious, often deadly damage to the animal,\" the\u00a0USDA\u00a0says. \"NWS can infest livestock, pets, wildlife, occasionally birds and, in rare cases, people.\"",
      "The USDA also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility for breeding fruit flies near Mexico's southernmost border with Guatemala into one for breeding sterile New World screwworm flies, but it won't be ready for 18 months.",
      "The U.S. bred and released sterile New World screwworm flies into the wild decades ago, and it was largely banished from the country in the 1960s. Previously, it had been an annual scourge for cattle ranchers and dairy farmers, particularly in the Southeast.",
      "Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegu\u00e9 said Wednesday in a post on X that Rollins' plan \"seems to us a positive step in different aspects, it will strengthen the joint Mexico-U.S. work.\"",
      "\"We trust the enthusiasm for cooperation that Secretary Rollins mentioned, and based on objective results and the reports from the USDA mission visiting us this week, we will be able to restart exports of our cattle as soon as possible,\" he said.",
      "The new Texas facility would be built at Moore Air Base, less than 20 miles from the Mexico border, and the USDA said it would also consider building a companion fly-breeding center there so that up to 300 million flies could be produced a week. The Panama facility breeds about 100 million a week, and the one in Mexico could breed as many as 100 million, as well.",
      "The USDA has said the flies have been detected as close as 700 miles from the U.S. border, and some U.S. agriculture and cattle industry officials have worried that if the migration isn't checked, the flies could reach the border by the end of summer.\u00a0Pressure from the U.S.\u00a0prompted Mexico to step up efforts to control the fly's spread.",
      "Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattle rancher and the president of the National Beef Cattlemen's Association, said Moore Air Base had a fly-breeding facility in the 1960s that helped eradicate it in the U.S.",
      "While there are treatments for New World screwworm infestations, cattle industry officials still worry that farmers and ranchers could see huge economic losses. They, agriculture officials and scientists also said the larvae can infest any mammal, including household pets, and it has occasionally been seen in humans.",
      "\"The only way to protect the American cattle herd from the devastating threat of New World screwworm is by having a sufficient supply of sterile flies to push this pest away from our border,\" Wehrbein said.",
      "Texas officials said they are grateful the U.S. is taking the screwworm threat seriously and are pleased with the plans for combating it, including the new facility in Texas.",
      "Officials in other states are watching the fly's migration, as well, and see that having sterile male flies outnumber the non-sterile ones is crucial to checking its migration.",
      "\"We have a real concern about wildlife because of their ability to cross the border unchecked somewhat, whether it's feral pigs, deer, wild cattle, whatever the case may be,\" Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said in a recent interview. \"There's an opportunity for them to be our exposure risk.\""

      "Social Security is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast, when the federal retirement program will be required to cut monthly benefits by about 20%.",
      "The new projection, issued Wednesday in the Social Security Board of Trustees'\u00a0annual report,\u00a0is partly due to increased costs from the Social Security Fairness Act, which boosted benefits for millions of retirees, the report said. Last year's report had forecast\u00a0that the program would need to cut benefits starting in 2035, impacting Social Security's 70 million beneficiaries.",
      "The Social Security program has been staring down a financial crunch for years, although the trust funds' depletion date can change from year to year due to fluctuations in the economy and the number of beneficiaries. The trust fund is slated to be depleted partly due to the wave of baby boomer retirements and an aging U.S. population, which means its reserves are drawing down because spending is outpacing income.",
      "\"Congress, along with the Social Security Administration and others committed to eliminating waste, fraud and abuse, must work together to protect and strengthen the trust funds for the millions of Americans who rely on it \u2014 now and in the future \u2014 for a secure retirement or in the event of a disability,\" said Frank Bisignano, commissioner of Social Security, in a statement.",
      "Here's the impact on your benefits",
      "Even if the trust funds are depleted \u2014 which may not occur if Congress makes changes to how the program is funded, for instance \u2014 benefits won't suddenly disappear.",
      "Instead, Social Security beneficiaries would see a 19% cut to their benefits, the report said.",
      "The current average Social Security benefit for a retiree stands at $1,976, which means a 19% reduction would take their monthly check down to about $1,600.",

      "Shoring up Social Security",
      "There are two ways to shore up Social Security, by either raising more revenue or cutting benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, an advocacy group for the program, in an email. \"Any politician who doesn't support increasing Social Security's revenue is, by default, supporting benefit cuts,\" she said.",
      "One method of raising more revenue for the program would be lift its income cap, which stands at $176,100. Earnings over that amount are exempt from the payroll tax, which funds Social Security.",
      "\"In poll after poll, the American people are clear that they strongly support making the wealthy pay their fair share into Social Security, and overwhelmingly oppose benefit cuts,\" Altman said.",
      "Some Republican lawmakers have suggested increasing the retirement age to as high as 70 as a way to fix the program's finances, but that would effectively act as a benefits cut for retirees, said Max Richtman, CEO of National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, in a statement.",

      "Changes to Social Security",
      "One of the changes to Social Security this year that will have a \"substantial\" impact on the program is the Social Security Fairness Act, which went into effect on January 5, the report said.",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act expanded benefits for millions by eliminating two federal\u00a0policies\u00a0that barred employees with a public pension from collecting their full benefits under the federal retirement program. Those same policies also\u00a0reduced\u00a0benefits for such workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Under the new law, about 3.2 million recipients are getting higher benefits, ranging from modest increases to more than $1,000 a month in additional money, the agency has said.",
      "Americans are also filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, the program's data shows. The number of people claiming benefits jumped 17% to 1.8 million\u00a0in 2025 through May versus the same period a year earlier, putting the program on track to enroll 4 million new beneficiaries in 2025.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the\u00a0Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0at the agency and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, which had already been struggling to provide services to retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "Anxieties about the stability of the program likely prompted some of the new filings, experts have told CBS MoneyWatch.",

    "story": [
      "An interview between Tucker Carlson and Sen. Ted Cruz about Israel's military campaign against Iran became contentious when the ex-Fox News host quizzed the Texas Republican about Iran \u2014 highlighting a rift among President Trump's allies.",
      "The back-and-forth hinged on Cruz's backing of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets. The Trump administration has stated the U.S. is not directly involved in the offensive, but it has helped Israel defend against Iranian counterattacks, and Mr. Trump has weighed conducting strikes on Iranian nuclear targets, CBS News has previously reported.",
      "Carlson \u2014 a vocal skeptic of military intervention \u2014 questioned the premise of joining a war with Iran and criticized Cruz for saying he would like the Iranian regime to be toppled, saying to Cruz at one point: \"You don't know anything about Iran.\"",
      "One of the most contentious exchanges in the two-hour interview \u2014 which was released in full on X Wednesday \u2014 came when Carlson asked Cruz what Iran's population is. Cruz said he wasn't sure.",
      "\"You don't know the population of the country you seek to topple?\" Carlson asked.",
      "\"I don't sit around memorizing population tables,\" Cruz retorted.",
      "The host then followed up by asking Cruz about Iran's demographics. When Cruz said they were Persians, predominantly Shia Muslims, Carlson asked him for the percentage, frustrating the Texas senator.",
      "\"Okay, I am not the Tucker Carlson expert on Iran,\" Cruz said.",
      "The two Trump supporters also argued about whether Iran has sought to assassinate Mr. Trump, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged last week. Federal prosecutors last year\u00a0announced charges against an Iranian asset, accusing him of plotting to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz cited the alleged assassination plots while criticizing Iran's leadership, but Carlson questioned why the senator hadn't instead supported immediate U.S. military action if he believed Iran has tried to kill Mr. Trump.",
      "Cruz, meanwhile, suggested Carlson at one point has a \"weird \u2026 obsession with Israel\" when Carlson asked about support from the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. Carlson said he interpreted the comment as an accusation of antisemitism, which Cruz denied.",
      "\"You don't know anything about the country whose government you want to overthrow, and you're calling me reckless,\" Carlson said late in the interview.",
      "\"I want to stop a lunatic who wants to murder us from getting nuclear weapons that could kill millions of Americans. You say 'I can't see how that benefits America in any way.' That is bizarre,\" Cruz responded.",
      "The sparring continued on social media, with Cruz accusing Carlson of \"playing a 'gotcha' on the population of Iran\" and mocking the question about Iran's size.",
      "The bitter exchange reflects a wider divide among Mr. Trump's backers on how involved the U.S. should get in the Israel-Iran conflict. The president has long criticized foreign intervention, but has also supported pressuring Iran.",
      "Mr. Trump's closest advisers have not reached agreement on whether the president should strike Iranian nuclear facilities, CBS News has reported.",
      "Some Republicans, in addition to Cruz, have backed a hardline policy against Iran and are open to the U.S. joining Israel in striking Iran. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\u00a0told CBS News over the weekend he would prefer a diplomatic resolution to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, but if that fails, he urged Mr. Trump \"to go all in to make sure that when this operation is over, there's nothing left standing in Iran regarding their nuclear program.\"",
      "During the interview, Cruz told Carlson he doesn't support sending U.S. troops into Iran, but told reporters Wednesday the president \"could quite reasonably make the decision\" to bomb Iran's subterranean nuclear site at\u00a0Fordo.",
      "But other Trump allies are wary of intervention. Former Trump strategist Steve Bannon told Carlson in an interview he views stopping \"forever wars\" as a core MAGA tenet, and suggested U.S. involvement in Iran could \"blow up the coalition\" and harm Mr. Trump's domestic priorities. Still, Bannon told reporters Wednesday he thinks \"the vast majority of the MAGA movement\" would trust Mr. Trump's judgment if he decides striking Iran is necessary.",
      "Meanwhile, a handful of congressional Republicans have called for a resolution blocking Mr. Trump from taking military action on Iran without congressional approval.",
      "It's unclear how the president will proceed, though he downplayed the idea of an intra-MAGA rift over Iran on Wednesday, telling reporters, \"my supporters are more in love with me today, and I'm in love with them.\"",
      "The president also repeatedly lashed out at Carlson on Monday, before the Cruz interview was released. The president called him \"kooky\" in a Truth Social post, and seemed to mock Carlson over his ouster from Fox News.",
      "\"I don't know what Tucker Carlson is saying,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Let him go get a television network and say it so that people listen.\"",

      "The war has also sparked an exodus from Iran's capital Tehran with video showing thousands of vehicles at a near standstill on primary exit routes. Those frantic escape bids were fueled by Mr. Trump's direct warning to Tehran's roughly 10 million inhabitants earlier this week to \"evacuate immediately.\"",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 British lawmakers voted Tuesday to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales after a lawmaker argued it was cruel to prosecute women for ending a pregnancy. The House of Commons approved an amendment to a broader crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished under an antiquated law.",
      "Tonia Antoniazzi, the Labour Party member of Parliament who introduced one of the amendments, said the change was needed because police have investigated more than 100 women for suspected illegal abortions over the past five years, including some who suffered natural miscarriages and stillbirths.",

      "Under current law, doctors can legally carry out abortions in England, Scotland and Wales up to 24 weeks, and beyond that under special circumstances, such as when the life of the mother is in danger. Abortion in Northern Ireland was decriminalized in 2019. There is no specific law in Scotland barring abortions, and the country is generally viewed as more lenient in its approach to enforcing other laws that could apply in abortion cases, though rights advocates continue to call for a domestic law specifically decriminalizing the act.",
      "Changes in the law implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic allow women to receive abortion pills through the mail and terminate their own pregnancies at home within the first 10 weeks in England and Wales. That has led to a handful of widely publicized cases in which women were prosecuted for illegally obtaining abortion pills and using them to end their own pregnancies after 24 weeks or more.",
      "Anti-abortion groups opposed the measures, arguing it would open the door to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy.",

    "story": [
      "Iran has two known underground nuclear enrichment sites, the one Israel attacked on the first day of its assault at Natanz, and another at Fordo. Both sit south of Tehran in central Iran, but Fordo has long been the Iranian nuclear facility of most concern to international monitors and experts.",
      "Buried deep in a mountain, Fordo is where many analysts believe Iran has concealed clandestine efforts to work toward a nuclear weapons capability. There have been no reported Israeli strikes on the Fordo enrichment facility.",
      "As recently as March, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said American intelligence agencies did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon, but Israel's military asserted hours after initiating its attack on Iran last week that the U.S. information was outdated, claiming Iran was \"racing towards a nuclear bomb.\"",
      "Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin claimed Friday that the country had intelligence indicating the Iranian regime \"has established a secret program, within the framework of which senior nuclear scientists in Iran secretly conducted the experiments required to build nuclear weapons.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters early Tuesday morning, President Trump appeared to have been swayed. Asked about the assessment Gabbard delivered in March, he said: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Iran's leaders have always denied any interest in building a nuclear weapon, insisting the program is for civilian purposes. But if that's obfuscation, as Israel insists, and the Iranians are close to a nuclear weapons capability, more than a decade of analysis of Iran's nuclear facilities by experts around the world suggests Fordo would be central to those efforts.",
      "Why is Iran's Fordo nuclear site such a concern?",
      "Two experts told CBS News in 2012 \u2014 the last time Netanyahu looked close to attacking Iranian nuclear facilities \u2014 that Fordo, buried almost 300 feet beneath a mountain and protected by significant air defenses, was the most likely location for a hypothetical nuclear weapons \"breakout\" program.",
      "Fordo is \"obviously for nuclear weapons hedging, to preserve centrifuges in case of an attack\" on other, more vulnerable facilities, Mark Fitzpatrick, an expert on Iran's nuclear program at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, told CBS News in 2012.",
      "Israel attacked the only other nuclear facility known to house significant uranium enrichment facilities in Iran last week, causing damage at Natanz.",
      "But the progress made at Fordo even at that stage, before the U.S.-brokered nuclear deal with Iran brought United Nations inspectors into the country, and since Mr. Trump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement during his first term, prompting an escalation of Iran's efforts, has remained unverified.",
      "The U.N.'s nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, declared Iran non-compliant with its monitoring efforts for the first time in 20 years just hours before Israel attacked. The lack of understanding of Iran's work at the facility has long been a concern, but those concerns have mounted in recent years, since the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear deal spurred Iran to reduce cooperation with international inspectors and ramp up its enrichment.",
      "In late 2023, Manuel Herrera, a weapons non-proliferation expert with two different European think tanks, said Fordo remained \"one of the main concerns regarding Iran.\"",
      "\"Fordo has always been a major concern because of its location and because of its size,\" Herrera said during a discussion with fellow Iran expert William Alberque, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"We all knew from the beginning that Fordo was a site that aimed to enrich uranium for weapons purposes, because of its location, because of its size, because of its technical capacity. And\u2026 that the Iranians have been expanding that site and also expanding the stockpile of enriched uranium in that site, should be a concern for us because, actually, we don't have a lot of transparency on what's going on there.\"",
      "Herrera noted that, \"in contrast with Natanz, which is overground, Fordo is underground \u2014 it's a facility which actually has a tunnel structure.\"",
      "In addition to its well-fortified location and structure, Herrera said Fordo \"has always been assumed to be an enrichment plant with military purposes\" due to the machinery at the site.",
      "He noted that the Iranian regime had boasted in 2019 of installing advanced \"IR-6\" centrifuges at Fordo, capable of enriching uranium to higher purity levels much more quickly than most of its older equipment. In early 2023, the IAEA said it had found uranium particles at Fordo enriched to almost 84% purity, which is incredibly close to the 90% purity uranium that would be required for a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"This tells us that the Iranians at least are experimenting with this kind of uranium enriched level,\" Herrera said.",

He is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now. But we don't want missiles shot at civilians, or American soldiers. Our patience is wearing thin.\"",
      "Israel's strikes hit Khamenei's inner circle",
      "\"I imagine the supreme leader is currently unable to sleep and worried about whether he'll be alive or not,\" Holly Dagres, a regional expert and senior fellow at the Washington Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Israel's ongoing strikes have killed several of Iran's top generals and security advisers to the ayatollah, dealing a blow to his inner circle, which, according to the Reuters news agency, consists of only 15 to 20 trusted loyalists. The dead include the commander-in-chief of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Hossein Salami, the chief of Iran's ballistic missile program Amir Ali Hajizadeh, and spy chief Mohammad Kazemi.",
      "On Tuesday, Israel's military boasted about killing the man tapped to replace the Iranian military's chief of staff, just four days after it killed his predecessor in its first round of strikes.",
      "\"We eliminated Ali Shadmani, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime,\" Israeli military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said Tuesday. \"He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation. He only managed to fill the position for 4 days.\"",
      "But even if Israel were to kill the ayatollah himself, Dagres said Iran's clerical regime has an established process in place to keep the government stable.",
      "Iran is not run by \"one man and some generals\"",
      "\"The thing with the Islamic Republic is this isn't just one man and some generals,\" Dagres told CBS News. \"This is a system or an apparatus that has been thought through very extensively. The Islamic Republic has something that's akin to the (Vatican's) College of Cardinals \u2014 the Assembly of Experts, and they actually determine who gets to be supreme leader.\"",
      "The top-level religious body, also known as Iran's Council of Experts, is composed of 88 senior Islamic clerics who are responsible for electing Iran's supreme leader, usually when the current one dies.",
      "\"From what we've been seeing so far, it doesn't sound like any of those people have been targeted\" by Israel, said Dagres. \"This is a replaceable regime in terms of leadership at the top, because they're prepared for the eventual death of a supreme leader.\"",
      "Even if Iran's entire theocratic system of government were to collapse, the upheaval would not necessarily guarantee a new government that is any friendlier to Iran's own repressed people, to Israel, or to the United States.",
      "\"There could be a scenario where the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps takes over, and they could go in different directions,\" said Dagres. \"They could be more authoritarian. They can be more Western-friendly. We don't know. I think one of the lessons of the Arab Spring, up until the fall of Assad, was that what happens isn't always better.\"",
      "Those Arab Spring pro-democracy uprisings across the Middle East in 2010 \u2014 in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Tunisia \u2014 were initially met with hope in the democratic Western world, but in most of those countries, the bids for democracy either devolved into civil war, or were beaten back by new or returning authoritarian regimes or the rise of extremist groups.",
      "Could internal tension threaten Iran's regime?",
      "Echoing Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned Iran's supreme leader on Tuesday he could suffer a fate similar to Iraq's former President Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi strongman's regime fell in 2003 after nearly a quarter century. He was found hiding in a bunker by U.S. forces and was then sentenced to death by a special Iraqi tribunal and hanged for crimes against humanity.",
      "\"I warn the Iranian dictator against continuing to commit war crimes and launch missiles toward Israeli civilians,\" Katz said on Tuesday. \"He should remember what happened to the dictator in the neighboring country to Iran who took the same path against Israel.\"",
      "Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat and commentator in Tel Aviv, told CBS News on Tuesday that the \"kinds of tensions that cause a regime to fall are usually internal, not external.\"",
      "\"A country of 10 million cannot precipitate a regime change in a country of 90 million,\" Pinkas noted, highlighting the vast discrepancy in size between Israel and the much larger Iran, which he noted was also 1,100 miles away.",
      "\"For that to happen, for a regime change to happen, you need basically a reenactment of the failed Iraq invasion [by the U.S.] of 2003,\" Pinkas said. \"And I don't think anyone wants that, certainly not the Americans.\"",
      "He views Netanyahu's call for Iranians to rise up against their own leadership as \"sheer arrogance.\"",
      "\"I doubt anyone living in Tehran and listening to Netanyahu would say, 'Oh, wow, you know, this is a call for action, I should get out and fight the regime because Mr. Netanyahu, a thousand miles away, told me to do so.'\"",
      "The last time mass anti-government street protests erupted in Iran was in 2022 with the so-called \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" movement. That outrage was sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's religious police, reportedly after being detained for an improper head covering.",
      "Netanyahu has repeated the three-word protest refrain in messages aimed directly at Iranians since his country launched its attacks late last week.",
      "But those protests in Iran were quashed quickly \u2014 and aggressively \u2014 by Iranian authorities and had died down by the spring of 2023.",
      "Since Israel started bombing Iran last week, no one has taken to the streets in Iranian cities. The country's residents appear to be focusing on the immediate threat, scrambling for shelter and to evacuate major cities as Israeli bombs fall.",
      "\"Why would you be on the streets if Israeli jets are bombarding those very streets or bombarding military targets not far from you,\" noted Pinkas. \"They're driving away, as far away as possible from Tehran \u2026 but I think that when the dust settles \u2014 and that could be in two, three days, it could also be in three weeks, I honestly cannot predict that \u2014 I think a lot of that anger will be taken out on the regime.\"",
      "In other words, even if Israel's actions don't prompt an immediate toppling of Iran's Islamic rulers, it could fuel Iranians' determination to stand up to their clerical leaders. If that happens, it could come at one of the ayatollah's weakest moments in almost half a century.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-real-end-iran-nuclear-program/",
    "published": "Tue, 17 Jun 2025 12:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Trump says he's not just \"looking for a ceasefire\" in the Israel-Iran war. He also warned all of Tehran's residents to evacuate.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said early Tuesday morning that he wants \"a real end\" to Iran's nuclear problem, with Tehran \"giving up entirely\" its enrichment activities. He said he was not just working toward a ceasefire to end the war between Iran and Israel, which has claimed at least two dozen lives in Israel and hundreds in Iran as it enters its fifth day.",
      "\"I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One after\u00a0cutting short his time at the G7 summit in Canada. \"We're looking for better than a ceasefire,\" he added.",
      "Hours later, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social, \"We now have complete and total control of the skies over Iran.\"",
      "He did not elaborate, but his statement came a day after Israel's military said it had taken full control of the airspace over Tehran.",
      "\"Iran had good sky trackers and other defensive equipment, and plenty of it, but it doesn't compare to American made, conceived, and manufactured 'stuff,'\" Mr. Trump said in his post Tuesday. \"Nobody does it better than the good ol' USA.\"",
      "Before Mr. Trump's post, administration officials had stressed that the U.S. was \"not involved in Israel's unilateral action against targets in Iran.\"",
      "The president also\u00a0said earlier\u00a0that French President Emmanuel Macron had \"mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a 'cease fire' between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump predicted that Israel would not slow its assault on Iran, which has largely decapitated the Islamic republic's military command and inflicted significant damage to its controversial nuclear program.",
      "\"You're going to find out over the next two days. You're going to find out. Nobody's slowed up so far,\" he said, hours after issuing an ominous warning that all of Tehran's roughly 10 million inhabitants should \"immediately evacuate.\"",
      "Asked about that warning on Air Force One early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted \"people to be safe,\" without offering any further explanation. Israel on Monday warned about 300,000 residents in a central district of Tehran to evacuate, pending attacks in the area.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested the reason he didn't want to stay in Canada was because he couldn't confidentially monitor developments in the Middle East. He said he could be \"more well versed\" in the White House Situation Room and avoid cellphones. \"I don't believe in telephones \u2014 because people like you listen to them,\" he told reporters on the plane. \"Being on the scene is much better.\"",
      "A source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News on Monday that Tehran had indicated to negotiators in Qatar and Oman that it was prepared to discuss a new deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but not while it was still under Israeli attack.",
      "The president said it was possible he could send special envoy Steve Witkoff or Vice President JD Vance, or both, to meet with Iranian negotiators, but \"it depends what happens when I get back\" to Washington.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Mr. Trump added. \"I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.\"",
      "Addressing any possible threat to U.S. interests in the region, Mr. Trump said Iran knew not to target U.S. forces, as the U.S. would \"come down so hard if they do anything to our people.\"",
      "The president declined to say whether Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lt. Gen. Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had provided him with options in the event Iran does attack U.S. bases in the Middle East.",
      "\"I can't tell you that,\" he said.",
      "Asked if it would take U.S. involvement to destroy Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Trump said he hoped it would be \"wiped out long before that.\"",
      "Vance says Trump has \"shown remarkable restraint\" but \"may decide he needs to take further action\"",
      "Vance weighed in on the Iran situation and Mr. Trump's response in a lengthy social media post Tuesday morning. Vance said the president has \"shown remarkable restraint\" in how he uses the U.S. military and that people are \"right to be worried about foreign entanglement,\" but argued the president has \"earned some trust on this issue.\"",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump \"may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,\" a decision that \"ultimately belongs to the president.\"",
      "\"And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people's goals,\" Vance wrote. \"Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",
      "Trump says Iran was \"very close\" to obtaining a nuclear weapon",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed the attack he ordered on Iran late last week as an \"existential\" battle for Israel's survival. He claimed intelligence \u2014 which Israel has not shared publicly \u2014 showed the country was \"racing\" toward the development of a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu, along with all recent U.S. presidents including Mr. Trump, have always said they could not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "Just several months ago, however, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard delivered an assessment to lawmakers that said U.S. agencies continued \"to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.\"",
      "Gabbard said the U.S. was continuing to \"monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program,\" and she noted that \"in the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.\"",
      "Asked on Air Force One about that assessment from Gabbard, that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Israel expands assault on Iran",
      "Israel expanded its aerial assault on Iran Monday, hitting not only nuclear and military facilities and assassinating senior military leaders, but targeting the regime-controlled media. Iranian State TV's sprawling headquarters in Tehran came under attack as the network was broadcasting.",
      "CBS News' Seyed Bathaei in Tehran said the network remained on the air, but that one part of its compound was on fire Monday evening.",
      "Asked about the strike on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said the network \"was used to spread anti-Israeli propaganda and called for genocide for several decades. We attacked it just as we attack all components of the Iranian terrorist regime and the plan to destroy Israel.\"",
      "In a clear show of domination over its long-time archrival, Israel also said Tuesday that it had killed the Iranian military's chief of staff Ali Shadmani, just four days after his predecessor was killed in Israel's first round of strikes.",
      "\"Following precise intelligence received by the Intelligence Branch, we eliminated Ali Shadamnai, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime. He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation.\"",
      "The attacks have sent thousands of Iranians racing to try to evacuate major cities. A massive explosion in the city of Isfahan was caught on someone's dashcam over the weekend as the passengers tried to flee.",
      "\"We can't leave. What else can we do,\" the car's anxious occupants can be heard saying.",
      "The human cost of the war is escalating on both sides. Iranian officials haven't provided an update since Sunday, when they said at least 220 people had been killed. They did not give a breakdown but said many civilians were among the casualties.",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu said Monday that at least 24 people had been killed by Iranian missiles that managed to evade the country's robust air defenses.",
      "The attacks continued Monday evening and into Tuesday morning, with Defrin saying Iran had launched 30 missiles, most of them intercepted, \"but several hits were identified.\"",
      "He did not report any new casualties, but warned Israelis: \"We must not be complacent, the Iranians still have intentions and the ability to strike.\"",
      "On Monday, an Iranian missile slammed into an apartment building in the central Israel city of Peta Tikva, killing four people.",
      "Israeli American Lihi Griner was there, with her husband and three children, hiding in their safe room.",
      "\"It was the biggest boom ever,\" she told CBS News. \"Even our safe room was shaking.\"",
      "When the family emerged, they found shattered glass strewn across their apartment.",
      "Given Mr. Trump's warnings and Netanyahu's stated determination to remove what he considers the multi-faceted threat posed by the Iranian regime, CBS News asked Griner if she was prepared for the war with Iran to get worse before it gets better.",
      "\"I'm not prepared,\" she said. \"I'm just gonna go and run in my little, you know, bomb shelter. I'm not prepared for everything. I wasn't prepared for this.\"",

      "The Association for the Promotion of China's Peaceful Reunification in New York has been repeatedly mentioned in reports coordinating with the CCP's United Front system, which has been called a \"magic weapon\" by Chinese President Xi Jinping due to its success at advancing the CCP's interests at home and abroad. According to a 2012 holiday greeting to House and Senate lawmakers, the China Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification (CCPPNR) formed at least 17 affiliates, including the New York chapter. A 2019 report from the Jamestown Foundation also said the United Front acts as one of the \"key executive agents\" of the council \"to exert control over ethnic Chinese communities abroad.\"",

      "\"Thousands of community members take photographs with the Mayor at public events,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Arran Hope, the editor of China Brief at the Jamestown Foundation, sounded the alarm about Wang when Fox News Digital reached out about her CCP ties, noting how she \"appears to be deeply involved with organizations in New York City that have strong ties to the Chinese Communist Party's united front system,\" including \"anniversary galas for united front organizations such as the U.S.\u2013Fujian Tangtou Friendship Association (\u7f8e\u56fd\u798f\u5efa\u5858\u5934\u8054\u8c0a\u4f1a) and the New York Chapter of the United Chinese American Association (\u7f8e\u56fd\u534e\u4eba\u534e\u4fa8\u8054\u5408\u603b\u4f1a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u5206\u4f1a).\"",

Hochul\u2019s former deputy chief of staff, Linda Sun, last year.\u00a0The unsealed indictment revealed that a speechwriter for then-Lt. Gov. Hochul wanted to mention the \"Uyghur situation\" in China for her 2021 Lunar New Year message, but the plight of the minority group being persecuted by the Chinese government was ultimately omitted after Sun overruled the speechwriter.",
      "The indictment says Sun revealed to Ping what the speechwriter wanted to include but insisted that she would not let her boss mention Uyghurs after admitting that she was \"starting to lose her temper\" with the speechwriter. Ping appeared to chalk up the speechwriter\u2019s suggestion as a clueless American who had never visited China and that U.S.-China relations could \"sour\" because of \"people like the speechwriter,\" the indictment said, prompting Sun to concur that the speechwriter had never visited China.

      "\"In the last week alone, several events have demanded this committee's immediate attention,\" Durbin said Wednesday. \"The horrific assassination in Minnesota, the treatment of our colleague Sen. Padilla by federal agents in Los Angeles, and President Trump's unprecedented deployment of the U.S. military in Los Angeles.",
      "\"We should hear without delay from Attorney General Bondi and FBI Director Patel about what they are doing to address the unacceptable political violence in our country, including threats to Article III judges and justices, as well as members of Congress,\" Durbin said. \"And we need to hear from the Homeland Security Secretary Noem about the treatment of our colleague, Sen.

Their absence speaks volumes, an implicit admission that the truth is too inconvenient to face.

      "7 expert tips to protect your Android from Crocodilus malware",
      "1. Avoid downloading apps from ads or unknown sources: Crocodilus often spreads through ads on social media platforms like Facebook. These ads promote apps that look like banking tools, e-commerce platforms or even crypto wallets. If you click and install one, you might be unknowingly downloading malware. Always search for apps directly on trusted platforms like the Google Play Store. Do not install anything from random links, especially those shared through ads, messages or unfamiliar websites.",
      "2. Avoid suspicious links and install strong antivirus protection: Crocodilus spreads through deceptive ads and fake app links. These can look like legitimate banking tools, crypto apps or browser updates. Clicking on them may quietly install malware that hijacks your contacts, monitors your screen or steals login credentials. To stay safe, avoid clicking on links from unknown sources, especially those that promise rewards or warn of urgent problems. Installing strong antivirus software on your Android device adds another layer of protection. It can scan downloads, block malicious behavior and warn you about phishing attempts before they become a bigger issue.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Review app permissions carefully before and after installation: Before you install an app, take a moment to look at the permissions it asks for. If a shopping app wants access to your contacts, messages or screen, that is a red flag. After installing, go to your phone settings and double-check what permissions the app actually has. Malware like Crocodilus relies on overreaching permissions to steal data and gain control. If anything seems unnecessary, revoke the access or uninstall the app entirely.",
      "4. Keep your Android device updated at all times: Security patches are released regularly to block known vulnerabilities. Crocodilus is designed to take advantage of outdated systems and bypass newer Android restrictions. By\u00a0updating your phone and apps regularly, you reduce the chances of malware slipping through. Set your device to install updates automatically when possible and check manually every so often if you are not sure.",
      "5. Consider using a data removal or monitoring service:\u00a0While not a direct defense against malware, data removal services can help minimize the damage if your information has already been leaked or sold. These services monitor your personal data on the dark web and offer guidance if your credentials have been compromised. In a case like Crocodilus, where malware may harvest and transmit banking info or crypto keys, knowing your data exposure early can help you act before scammers do.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "6. Turn on Google Play Protect: Google Play Protect is a built-in security feature on Android phones that scans your apps for anything suspicious. To stay protected, make sure it\u2019s turned on. You can check this by opening the Play Store, tapping your profile icon and selecting Play Protect. From there, you can see if it's active and run a manual scan of all your installed apps. While it may not catch everything, especially threats from outside the Play Store, it\u2019s still an important first layer of defense against harmful apps like Crocodilus.",
      "7. Be skeptical of unfamiliar contacts or urgent messages: One of the newer tricks Crocodilus uses is modifying your contact list. It can add fake entries that look like customer service numbers or bank helplines. So, if you receive a call from \"Bank Support,\" it might not be real. Always verify phone numbers through official websites or documents. The same applies to messages asking for personal details or urgent logins. When in doubt, do not respond or click any links. Contact your bank or service provider directly.",

It spreads through social media ads, hides inside apps that look real and collects sensitive data like banking passwords and crypto seed phrases. It can also add fake contacts to your phone to trick you during scam calls. If you use Android, avoid downloading apps from links in ads or messages. Only install apps from trusted sources like the Google Play Store. Keep your phone updated, and be careful if something looks too good to be true because it probably is.",

      "ANYmal-D, a four-legged robot that can play badminton with people\u00a0 (ETH Zurich)",
      "How does ANYmal-D play badminton with humans?",
      "Badminton is a game that requires quick footwork, fast reactions, and precise hand-eye coordination. To give a robot a chance on the court, the\u00a0ETH Zurich team equipped ANYmal-D with four legs for stability and agility, a dynamic arm to swing the racket, and a stereo camera to track the shuttlecock. The robot uses a reinforcement learning-based controller, which allows it to predict and react to the shuttlecock's movement in real-time. ANYmal-D can move around the court, adjust its posture, and time its swings, keeping rallies going with human players for up to 10 shots.",
      "NO TENNIS PARTNER? NO WORRIES WITH THIS AI ROBOT",
      "The technology behind ANYmal-D's badminton skills",
      "ANYmal-D's stereo camera serves as its eyes, constantly monitoring the shuttlecock. The robot uses a \"perception noise model\" to compare what it sees with data from its training, helping it track the shuttlecock even when it moves unpredictably. The robot can pitch its body to keep the shuttlecock in view, mimicking how a human player might lean in for a tricky shot.",

      "Coordinating legs and an arm is tough for any robot. The ETH Zurich team developed a unified control policy using reinforcement learning, allowing ANYmal-D to move and swing as a coordinated whole. This system was trained in simulation, so the robot learned how to handle a wide range of shots and situations before stepping onto a real court.",

On average, it took about 0.357 seconds to process the shuttlecock's trajectory after a human hit, leaving just over half a second to get into position and make the shot. While it didn't return every shot, the robot's ability to maintain rallies and adjust to the pace of the game highlights how far robotics has come in dynamic sports scenarios.",

      "4. Monitor your financial accounts regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements every few days. Set up alerts for any activity, and if you're not actively applying for credit, consider freezing your credit reports with all three bureaus.",
      "5. Use alias email addresses:\u00a0Create separate email addresses for things like online shopping, sign-ups, and banking. This helps keep your primary inbox private and makes it easier to trace which services may be leaking or selling your information.

      "6. Don't click suspicious links or attachments,\u00a0and use strong antivirus software: Phishing attempts often look convincing, especially if scammers already know your name or other details. If something feels off, delete the message and go directly to the website instead of clicking the link. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "8. Block robocalls and filter scam numbers: A surge in robocalls is a strong sign your phone number is being sold or shared by data brokers. These calls often come from spoofed or international numbers and may include\u00a0fake IRS agents,\u00a0tech support scams, or phony insurance offers. To fight back, enable your phone carrier's spam call protection (AT&T ActiveArmor, Verizon Call Filter, or T-Mobile Scam Shield). You can also use third-party apps like RoboKiller, Hiya, or Truecaller to screen calls, block known scam numbers, and report suspicious callers. Be sure to avoid answering unknown calls, even pressing a button to \"opt out\" can confirm your number is active and lead to more spam.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and his tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal have changed how we move money. They are fast and convenient, but with that ease comes exposure. If you send funds to the wrong person, they are likely gone for good. There is often no real path to recovery, especially when the recipient disappears behind a fake username and an unresponsive support system.",
      "This vulnerability becomes even more dangerous in moments of crisis. During natural disasters, high-profile social movements, or health emergencies, people are moved to give. Scammers know this and exploit the impulse. One such scam involved a fake Venmo account pretending to collect donations for a Minnesota nonprofit after the death of George Floyd. The account looked legitimate, but the funds never reached the organization.",
      "A similar scam is targeting Miles Perret Cancer Services, a nonprofit based in Louisiana. Scammers have created a fraudulent Venmo account that closely mimics the legitimate Venmo handle of the cancer nonprofit organization. They are using this fake account to trick well-meaning donors into sending money, believing they are supporting the real charity.",

Their real handle is\u00a0@milesperretcs. The scammer\u2019s account uses\u00a0@milesperretcs_, a nearly indistinguishable copy.",
      "To the average person, the difference is invisible. That is precisely what makes it dangerous.",
      "\"We reported this account through the app more than 24 hours ago,\"\u00a0Timothy Rinaldi, executive director of MPCS, told Cyberguy.\u00a0\"There has been no follow-up from Venmo. We tried the live chat option, but it was abruptly closed with no resolution.\"",
      "Instead of helping, Venmo routed Rinaldi through generic FAQs and legal disclaimers. Even after he was connected with a live support agent, the responses were standard scripts. He was told that the issue had been escalated, but no one could provide a timeline beyond a vague window of three to five business days.",

      "Fake Venmo accounts have been used in recent years to exploit donation drives for hurricane relief, animal shelters, medical funds, and other causes. The formula is simple. Take a known nonprofit, tweak the username slightly, and ride the momentum of goodwill. By the time anyone catches on, the money is gone and the damage is done.",
      "The incident involving MPCS is not an isolated case. In December 2024, Final Victory Animal Rescue, a nonprofit based in South Carolina,\u00a0discovered a Venmo account impersonating the organization and collecting donations intended for the real charity.

      "Scammers aren\u2019t just targeting charities. They\u2019re after anyone and everyone. Here are a few ways to protect yourself and keep your hard-earned money safe.",
      "1) Always access the payment app from the official app or website, and not from any third-party platforms or services.",
      "2) Look at the security settings that the payment app offers and make sure they\u2019re all set to the highest and most protective settings.",
      "3) Consider using a personal data removal service to protect your privacy and reduce your risk of scams.\u00a0Scammers who target payment apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal often rely on information found on data broker and people-search sites to craft convincing impersonations or phishing attempts. These sites can list your name, address, phone number, and even connections to organizations you support, making it easier for fraudsters to trick you or others into sending money to fake accounts.",
      "Personal data removal services work by automatically removing your information from hundreds of data broker sites, making it much harder for scammers to find and misuse your details. By scrubbing your data from these sources, you lower your risk of being targeted in payment app scams and reduce the likelihood that someone could impersonate you or a nonprofit you care about.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "4) Create a strong, unique and complex password for each of your mobile payment apps and change it often. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication, which means that you need to enter a code or use your fingerprint or face to unlock your account to prevent unauthorized access. This way, even if someone knows your password, they can\u2019t log in without your device or confirmation.",
      "6) Lock your device and log out of your apps. You should always lock your phone with a password, PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face. Never share your password, PIN, or security code with anyone. You should also log out of your mobile payment apps after each use and turn off the auto-login feature. This way, even if someone takes or borrows your device, they can\u2019t access your mobile payment apps without your approval.",
      "7) Verify the identity and legitimacy of the sender or receiver. You should always check the name, photo, username, and contact information of the person or organization you are sending money to or receiving money from before accepting or sending any payment requests. You should also confirm the reason and amount of the transaction before you agree to it. If you are not sure or have any doubts, you should contact the person or organization directly through another way, such as a phone call, text message, or email, but only if you know for sure that those forms of communication are legitimate. You should never send money or give your account details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, or anyone who asks you to do so out of the blue.",
      "8) Link your Venmo to a credit card as opposed to a debit card, so you can dispute a charge from scammers more easily. However, keep in mind, linking a credit card to your payment app can provide additional protection in the event of fraud, but this can come with extra costs in terms of transaction fees.",
      "9) Try not to keep a balance in your money-transferring apps.\u00a0You have a much better chance of being helped by your bank or credit card company when it comes to fraud than you do from a money-transferring app.",
      "10) Use strong antivirus software and never click on links from unknown sources,\u00a0especially when an email or text appears to have come from the payment App. Protect yourself from accidentally clicking on malicious links by running antivirus software on your device.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "11) Monitor your account activity and report any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.\u00a0You should set up notifications from your payment app and your bank via text or email, and check your account activity regularly. Look for any signs of fraud, such as payments you didn\u2019t make or receive, or changes to your account settings or information.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Unlike traditional banks, which are bound by federal consumer protection laws and fraud resolution timelines, peer-to-peer payment apps operate in a much looser regulatory environment. Services like Venmo often state in their user agreements that they are not responsible for mistaken or unauthorized payments unless there is clear evidence of account compromise or technical malfunction. Venmo\u2019s only suggestion here was to respond to a support ticket and wait. There was no emergency fraud hotline, no dedicated contact for nonprofits, and no indication that urgent action would be taken. Payment apps that allow donations to flow as quickly as a text message must also bear the responsibility of keeping those transactions safe. When a nonprofit has to beg for support just to protect its own identity, something is broken.",

Imagine a robot that can help with chores or serve as a hands-on learning tool. HopeJR is designed to be just that.",
      "One of the biggest talking points is price. Hugging Face aims to keep HopeJR affordable, with an estimated cost of around $3,000.

      "\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.",
      "\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.",

      "Scammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.",
      "If you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.",
      "Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords",
      "Make sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password.\u00a0Consider using a\u00a0password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

      "However, breaches do not always originate from hospitals or health apps. Increasingly, patient data is managed by third-party vendors offering digital services such as scheduling, billing and marketing.",

The database was publicly accessible online, unprotected by passwords or authentication protocols. Anyone with basic knowledge of database scanning tools could have accessed it.",

      "Clues within the data structure point toward Gargle, a Utah-based company that builds websites and offers marketing tools for dental practices. While not a confirmed source, several internal references and system details suggest a strong connection. Gargle provides appointment scheduling, form submission and patient communication services. These functions require access to patient information, making the firm a likely link in the exposure.",

      "Medical identity theft allows attackers to impersonate patients and access services under a false identity. Victims often remain unaware until significant damage is done, ranging from incorrect medical records to unpaid bills in their names. The leak also opens the door to insurance fraud, with actors using institutional references and chart data to submit false claims.",
      "This type of breach raises questions about compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which mandates strong security protections for entities handling patient data. Although Gargle is not a healthcare provider, its access to patient-facing infrastructure could place it under the scope of that regulation as a business associate.",

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

    "story": [
      "The technology combines direct air capture with on-site fuel synthesis, providing fossil-free gasoline.",
      "Recently, Aircela, a fuel company headquartered in New York, publicly demonstrated a machine in Manhattan that produces gasoline directly from air.",
      "The event attracted city and state officials, investors and energy professionals who witnessed the launch of this compact, refrigerator-sized unit.",
      "Aircela's technology combines direct air capture with on-site fuel synthesis, providing fossil-free gasoline that is fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure.",

      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",
      "Physicist Klaus Lackner, at left, and Eric Dahlgren, co-founder and CEO of Aircela, at right\u00a0\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Distributed production sets Aircela apart",
      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

      "Aircela has secured funding from notable investors, including Chris Larsen, founder of Ripple Labs' Jeff Ubben, a board member at ExxonMobil; and Maersk Growth, the venture capital arm of A.P. Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel's purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.",

The company's goal is to increase production, reduce costs and make the technology widely available. While the current output is modest, Aircela aims to provide a practical, climate-aligned alternative to fossil fuels that does not require people to change their vehicles or daily habits.",

      "Aircela's gasoline-from-air machine shows that sometimes the best solutions are the ones that fit right into our daily routines. Instead of requiring new cars or major changes, this technology lets people keep using what they already have, just with cleaner fuel. Watching carbon pulled from the air and turned into gasoline on the spot feels like a practical step toward a more sustainable future.",

      "I recommend a few ways to\u00a0delete your private information, including your home address, from such websites.",
      "1. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0Data brokers can sell your home address and other personal data to multiple businesses and individuals, so the key is to act fast.

They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "2. Opt out manually : Use a free scanner provided by a data removal service to check which people search sites that list your address. Then, visit each of these websites and look for an opt-out procedure or form: keywords like \"opt out,\" \"delete my information,\" etc., point the way.",
      "Follow each site\u2019s opt-out process carefully, and confirm they\u2019ve removed all your personal info, otherwise, it may get relisted.",
      "3. Monitor your digital footprint:\u00a0I recommend regularly searching online for your name to see if your location is publicly available. If only your social media profile pops up, there\u2019s no need to worry. However, people finder sites tend to relist your private information, including your home address, after some time.",
      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your home address is more vulnerable than you think. People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process. By understanding how your location is collected and taking measures to remove your address from online sites, you can reclaim control over your personal data.",

      "1. Don\u2019t overshare: Even with AI tools like ChatGPT",
      "AI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations. Remember that AI systems store and process your inputs, and despite security promises, data breaches can occur.",
      "SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST 1 CHATGPT SEARCH",
      "Tip: Treat all online forms of AI interaction like public forums. Keep your examples generic and use caution with anything that could identify you.",
      "If you're going to input your personal information while using these AI tools, ensure there is an option to prevent them from sharing it. On ChatGPT, for instance, do the following:",

      "CLEAN UP YOUR PHONE: SPEED, STORAGE AND PRIVACY BOOST IN MINUTES",
      "2. Use alias email addresses",
      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

Use Facebook's\u00a0Privacy Checkup tool to review and adjust crucial settings, including post visibility, app permissions, search visibility and friend-request settings. This comprehensive tool helps ensure your profile remains as private as you want it to be. You can find the tool by following these steps:",

It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

It is a discipline that teaches reverence for nuance, a chastened appreciation of history, and intellectual humility. But you wouldn\u2019t know that from the keynote speech at UCLA\u2019s recent Humanities commencement ceremonies.",
      "Caribbean Fragoza took to the podium donning a keffiyeh, declaring \"From the river to the sea\" (a slogan widely recognized as a call for the eradication of Israel and the Jews within it) and delivering a lesson in solipsism and sophistry.

      "ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS TORCH DIPLOMAS OUTSIDE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ON GRADUATION DAY",
      "Fragoza\u2019s speech was laced not with intellectual nuance, but with the rhetorical certitudes of the picket line. She introduced the issue of Palestine, without irony, by recalling an episode in which she explained a watermelon-themed art project to her five-year-old with the words \"Free Palestine.\" She submitted the child\u2019s understanding of the issue as proof of its moral simplicity.

Following the massacre of Oct. 7, 2023, it has become a political symbol\u2014one inseparable from Arab nationalism -- that grew in popularity after the 1936\u201339 Arab Revolt.

      "When Fragoza sought to subtly liken Donald Trump to a fascist, no administrator wondered whether such commentary, directed at a graduating class that likely includes many Trump supporters, was divisive or inflammatory.",
      "And when she declared that \"brown\" students, regardless of immigration status, could expect to be rounded up and deported at the state\u2019s discretion, no professor flagged it as the straw-man fallacy it so clearly was. Instead, political hyperbole became the university\u2019s parting message to its students.",
      "The animating metaphor of Fragoza\u2019s speech was fire. She invoked the Rodney King riots not as a tragedy, not even as a cautionary tale, but as a righteous blaze. She affectionately recalled the looting of \"free TVs\" as though they were trophies of justice.",
      "It's becoming commonplace: Families that travel great distances to honor their loved ones are often subjected to such political theater. Gone are the days of Mary Schmich\u2019s \"Wear Sunscreen\" speech, when graduation speeches were meant to celebrate or inspire. The UCLA students received a sendoff soaked in paranoia and propaganda. For Jewish students, including some who did not know whether their loved ones in Israel had survived Iran\u2019s recent missile barrage targeting civilians, it was all too raw.",
      "That such rhetoric passed without objection is not merely a failure of decorum. It is an indictment of the academy itself. Nor was this an isolated incident. At UCLA\u2019s many graduation ceremonies this weekend, it was the norm.",
      "When student leaders read the School of Public Health's oath, students in the crowd chanted \"except in Palestine\" in call-and-response, without reprimand. According to an official club in the School of Public Health\u2019s social media, a bulletin was passed out to graduating students declaring \"ACAB,\" the acronym for \"All Cops Are Bastards,\" \"All I.C.E. melts eventually,\" and \"THE STRUGGLE FOR PALESTINAN LIBERATION IS ANTIRACISM WORK.\"",

      "Jonathan Ruhe, Director of Foreign Policy for JINSA, spoke with Fox News Digital about bunker-busters, and how Israel or the U.S. might use them to eliminate the Fordow nuclear threat.",
      "IN IRAN\u2019S \u2018FOREVER WAR\u2019 AGAINST THE US, REGIME HAS TARGETED, KILLED AMERICANS WORLDWIDE",
      "Illustration showing how a GBU-57 Bunker Buster is deployed. (Fox News\u00a0)",
      "Ruhe said bunker busters are munitions designed to use the force of gravity to \"penetrate through any mixture of earth, rock, and concrete before the bomb itself then explodes\" underground. The explosion may either take out the target fully, or \"collapse the structure\" around the target \"without necessarily obliterating it,\" he explained.",
      "Bunker busters come in multiple weight classes. Israel possesses 2,000- and 5,000-pound varieties. Only the U.S. possesses the 30,000-pound GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordinance Penetrator (MOP).",
      "Developed under President George W. Bush, Ruhe says the MOP was \"designed specifically\" for targets like Fordow, where nuclear sites or command and control bunkers are hidden far underground.",
      "Two separate bombs are dropped by a B2 Spirit stealth bomber. (Fox News)",
      "Ruhe said that the number of munitions required to target Fordow depends on the depth of the facility. The Foundation for Defense of Democracies states that Fordow\u2019s facility is between 60 and 90 meters (196 to 295 feet) below ground. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Rafael Grossi told The Financial Times last week that the facility reaches 800 meters underground.",
      "Ruhe said Grossi, who has been to the Fordow facility, may have been \"trying to message, \u2018hey, military action is not the solution here.\u2019\"",

      "The illustration shows the first bomb exploding and creating a hole. (Fox News)",
      "The MOP is said to have a penetration depth of 200 feet. Ruhe said that given Fordow\u2019s distance underground and the difficulty of penetrating the rocky mountainside the site is dug into, the U.S. would likely use a technique called burrowing, in which a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber would \"drop several MOPs in succession, one after the other.\"",
      "Fordow poses a unique target. Ruhe said that pilots have to take into account the facility\u2019s multiple, narrow exit tunnels, and achieve the right angle of impact to penetrate the ground.",
      "Though Israeli air dominance over Iran has eliminated the need for stealth air assets, Ruhe believes the stealth B-2 would be the only tool adequate for delivering the MOPs. Ruhe said timing constraints make the use of B-52 bombers \"not relevant.\"",
      "Additionally, Ruhe explained that talk of loaning B-2 bombers to the Israeli Air Force is \"a dangerous distraction.\" Not only is there \"0.0% chance\" that the U.S. would give out this strategic capability, but Ruhe says training Israeli pilots to fly the B-2 would take several months.",
      "A second bomb follows into the hole and explodes, causing more damage. (Fox News)",
      "Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Fox News Digital that \"destroying [Fordow] from the air is a job only the U.S. can do.\"",

      "Given that Israel is \"very tactically inventive\" and \"very good at maximizing the capabilities they do have,\" Ruhe says that Israel could achieve its goals at Fordow without the MOP.",
      "Not only did Ruhe offer the unlikely but not impossible scenario where Israel might \"storm the site in a commando raid,\" but he said that Israel could use F-15s, escorted by F-35s, to deliver multiple 5,000-pound bunker busters over Fordow, utilizing the same burrowing tactic the U.S. would likely employ.",

      "Such a strike, he admitted, would \"achieve a more limited definition of success\" than the MOP could.",
      "The U.S. and Israel are likely to have different goals in targeting Fordow, Ruhe said. \"Americans tend to think of obliterating targets,\" Ruhe said, whereas Israel would \"probably be fine with saying they knocked back the operations there by a year or so.\"",
      "Ruhe estimates that the bunker busters may not completely destroy the facility, but that it may be considered a success if it were to knock out the power source to Iranian centrifuges, or making \"the air too polluted\" for centrifuges to operate.",

      "After nearly 150 days since President Donald Trump entered office, the U.S. still does not have an ambassador to the United Nations despite geopolitics playing a cornerstone role in his second term.",
      "Following the withdrawal of Elise Stefanik from the nomination in late March over concerns that Republicans would not be able to hold onto her New York seat in the case of a special election, Trump nominated former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz for the top job on May 1.",
      "Though his nomination process appears to be just now moving forward as the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which needs to vote on his confirmation before a full Senate vote can be cast, only just confirmed receipt of the nomination on Thursday.",

      "The White House did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital\u2019s questions about what the holdup could be, given that other nominations, like that of Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, were pushed through within five days of Trump entering the Oval Office.",
      "Though the lack of a U.S. ambassador to the U.N. is not necessarily \"dangerous,\" it weakens the U.S.\u2019s ability to influence major geopolitical situations at a time when the U.S. is facing some of its greatest multifront geopolitical challenges since World War II.",

      "Schaefer explained that though the U.S. does not have a Senate-approved official in place at the U.N., it does not mean the administration does not have representatives at U.N. headquarters in New York working to push U.S. interests.",

      "Wachtel also pointed out that with all the conflicts around the world, whether the U.S. is directly involved or not, including Russia's war in Ukraine, Israel's war against Iran and in Gaza, as well as broader crises like world hunger, Washington needs its voice heard, otherwise its adversaries will go unchallenged.",
      "\"[There's] just too many things going on in the world and too much ground to cover,\" Wachtel added. \"And instead of the U.S. voice heard [at the UN], you're going to have the press corps here and diplomats listening more to the arguments of our adversaries, frankly speaking.\"",

      "A group of foreign policy and security experts have compiled a report looking at a solution for a \"day after\" plan in Gaza, and believe private security contractors, which have heavy experience in the Mideast could be a solution to replace Hamas.",
      "The question of a \"day after\" plan in the Gaza Strip has plagued negotiations between Israel, the U.S., Arab nations and Hamas for months and has ultimately led to the terrorist network\u2019s refusal to release the 55 hostages still held there.",
      "However, foreign policy leaders and security experts based in Washington may have the key that could provide a solution to help rebuild the war-torn Gaza Strip where others cannot: private security contractors (PSC).",

      "In a plan hatched out following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the subsequent outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip, a group of eight members with JINSA and the Vandenberg Coalition comprised a report that detailed how the handling of humanitarian aid could completely change security in the region.",
      "The plan, in part, initially looked similar to the mechanism known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by the U.S. and Israel, and which launched last month to distribute aid to Palestinians.",

      "\"We needed a solution on humanitarian aid,\" Hannah said. \"And when we looked around the world, who could do this, take over the humanitarian aid? We were left with one option.\"",

      "PSCs have a storied history in the Middle East, and not only the U.S. war on terror. They have been used by nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which could lend them a level of acceptance that would not be attainable by another force.",

      "\"It's not at all foreign to these Arab parties that you might employ PSCs for certain critical missions,\" Hannah said. \"Our idea was, let's scale it up. Let's unify the effort. Let's have America and the Arabs lead it.",
      "\"The Arabs would put in most of the humanitarian aid workers, a lot of the financing, and then they would hire some of these international PSCs with a lot of experience to come in and protect those operations,\" he explained. \"You'd have the Arabs engaged, which we thought was absolutely critical.\"",
      "The plan also included bringing in other international aid organizations that would work with these PSCs to expand developments like housing projects, community development and infrastructure repair to restore electricity and water.",
      "\"And eventually, hopefully, begin to identify new leadership, local leadership in Gaza, who would be prepared to cooperate with the operations of this nonprofit entity,\" Hannah said. \"Local Gazans of goodwill, who wanted to be rid of Hamas, who this entity could provide some support to, some protection to so they can, could begin rebuilding Gaza civil administration.\"",

      "Comments by President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have painted a different picture, suggesting that Iran is racing toward creating a nuclear weapon.",
      "Trump said Wednesday that Iran was \u201ca few weeks\u201d from having a nuclear weapon, and Netanyahu said in a recent interview that Iran was pursuing a \u201csecret plan\u201d to build a bomb within months.",
      "\u201cThe intel we got and we shared with the United States was absolutely clear, was absolutely clear that they were working on a secret plan to weaponize the uranium,\u201d Netanyahu recently told Fox News. \u201cThey were marching very quickly. They would achieve a test device and possibly an initial device within months and certainly less than a year.\u201d",
      "U.S. intelligence reporting on Israel is typically based in part on information provided by Israel\u2019s intelligence services. It was unclear whether Netanyahu\u2019s remarks were based on a different interpretation of the same intelligence.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee, told reporters he was perplexed by Trump's assertions as lawmakers have received a different picture from U.S. intelligence officials.",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, told lawmakers in March that U.S. spy agencies assessed that Iran had not made a decision to build nuclear weapons but that it had stockpiles of enriched uranium far beyond what is required for civilian purposes. The U.S. intelligence community\u2019s view has not changed since her testimony, the source with knowledge of the matter said.",
      "Warner said Wednesday that he received further confirmation of the March intelligence assessment \u201cthis week.\u201d",

      "\u201cSo far, at least, the intelligence community has stood by its conclusion that Iran is not moving towards a nuclear weapon. They were enriching additional uranium, but they were not weaponizing that yet, and that [decision] was left with the supreme leader,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf there has been a change in that intelligence, I need to know, and I want to make sure that if it is changed, it\u2019s based upon fact and not political influence,\u201d he said.",

      "For Iran to acquire a nuclear arsenal, it would need to enrich uranium to 90% purity. At the moment, it has a significant amount of uranium enriched to 60%, about 400 kilograms\u2019 worth, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency.",
      "It would take a small technical step to enrich to 90%. Iran has enough uranium now to produce up to 10 weapons over several weeks, according to U.S. officials\u2019 estimates.",
      "But enriching uranium to weapons-grade levels is only the first step. Then Iran would have to build and test a device that could be delivered in the form of a bomb or a missile. Estimates vary, but Western officials and analysts say it could take months to more than a year to build a nuclear weapon.",
      "Weapons experts say that Iran is not weeks away from securing a nuclear weapon but that it is weeks away from securing enough fissile material for an eventual weapon.",
      "The director general of the IAEA, Rafael Grossi, said in a report this month that \u201cIran is the only non-nuclear-weapon state in the world that is producing and accumulating uranium enriched to 60 percent.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, an outspoken critic of past U.S. military interventions abroad, appears to have fallen out of favor with President Donald Trump as he weighs military action against Iran, according to multiple senior administration officials with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Gabbard allies insist that, while there is some White House tension, some of the public blowback is overstated, and none interviewed by NBC News expect her to leave the administration as a result of the president\u2019s Iran policy, even if that includes direct U.S. involvement.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s politically perilous position burst into the open this week when Trump brushed her back over her testimony to Congress in March. At that time, she said the U.S. intelligence community did not believe Iran was building a nuclear weapon \u2014 a comment at odds with Trump\u2019s recent public statement about the threat posed by Iran\u2019s potential nuclear program.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what she said. I think they were very close to having one,\u201d Trump told reporters Tuesday on Air Force One.",
      "A person with knowledge of the matter said the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s view has not changed since Gabbard\u2019s testimony in March.",
      "But the idea that a president would openly refute his director of national intelligence immediately spurred questions about whether she is now iced out of decision-making on the issue.",
      "It also reflects a rift that is playing out publicly in Trump\u2019s MAGA coalition, with some supporters advocating standing by Israel in whatever military action it takes against Iran and others saying intervention would go against the \u201cAmerica First\u201d philosophy. Trump\u2019s criticism of U.S. involvement in past conflicts \u2014 and his campaign promise to be a \u201cpeacemaker\u201d in his second term \u2014 brought in unusual bedfellows, such as Gabbard, who had been a Democratic congresswoman.",
      "Multiple senior administration officials said Gabbard has been sidelined in internal administration discussions about the conflict between Israel and Iran. Even two of her allies who spoke to NBC News acknowledged that her standing took a hit when she posted a video on June 10 after a trip to Hiroshima, Japan. The video, which featured the simulated destruction of American cities and Gabbard warning about the dangers of nuclear war, annoyed the White House team, the officials said.",
      "Gabbard did not attend a meeting of top officials June 8 at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, to discuss tensions between Israel and Iran, which raised fresh questions about her status in the administration. A White House official told NBC News that Gabbard was not present only because she had to take part in scheduled training as a member of the National Guard.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s past positions on Iran, coupled with her recent comments and Trump\u2019s responses to them, have forced top administration officials into a difficult position. Gabbard has seemingly been at odds with the administration line, but not to the point where they feel the need to abandon her.",
      "\u201cTulsi is a veteran, a patriot, a loyal supporter of Pres Trump and a critical part of the coalition he built in 2024,\u201d Vice President JD Vance said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019s an essential member of our nat sec team, & we\u2019re grateful for her tireless work to keep America safe from foreign threats.\u201d",
      "Other Republicans, though, have taken shots at her recent Iran comments.",
      "\u201cShe obviously needs to change her meds,\u201d Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., told Jewish Insider last week.",
      "Gabbard has long used her public platform to oppose U.S. military action against Iran and has been working behind the scenes to try to find a diplomatic solution, two of the administration officials said.",
      "In one case, Gabbard sought to enlist the help of European allies who have communication channels with Tehran, an official said.",
      "That stands, at times, in direct conflict with Trump\u2019s public comments about the now open fight between Israel and Iran, a fight he himself has acknowledged might now require U.S. intervention.",
      "\u201cI may do it. I may not do it. I mean, nobody knows what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d Trump told reporters Wednesday.",
      "Gabbard allies who spoke to NBC News acknowledge that the video was not received well by White House officials but said reported rifts between her and Trump on the issue have been overstated.",
      "\u201cI have heard that also,\u201d a Gabbard ally said of the tension spurred by the Hiroshima video. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it reached the level of the president himself. I am told the matter has been \u2018resolved.\u2019\u201d",
      "The Gabbard ally downplayed any idea that she would resign over the public Trump rebuke or whether the United States got directly involved in the Iran-Israel conflict.",
      "\u201cThe online claim that she will resign if the president decides to take direct action in Iran are false,\u201d the person said.",
      "The video, however, did circulate widely among White House aides, and it left many wondering why she was taking such a public position as tensions escalate and Trump appears ready to get further involved.",
      "\u201cI think she is generally in OK standing,\u201d a Republican operative familiar with administration thinking said. \u201cIn situations like this, folks with more traditional Republican and neocon views are going to use the opportunity to minimize her influence.\u201d",
      "Asked about the recent video on Hiroshima, Gabbard\u2019s deputy chief of staff, Alexa Henning, said: \u201cAcknowledging the past is critical to inform the future. President Trump has repeatedly stated in the past that he recognizes the immeasurable suffering, and annihilation can be caused by nuclear war, which is why he has been unequivocal that we all need to do everything possible to work towards peace.\u201d",
      "As a Democratic congresswoman, presidential candidate and supporter of Trump\u2019s 2024 campaign, Gabbard portrayed herself as a fierce opponent of what she sees as America\u2019s misguided military interventions overseas, including the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. assistance for rebels in Libya and Syria.",
      "In last year\u2019s electoral campaign, Gabbard accused the Biden administration of bringing the United States \u201ccloser to the brink of nuclear war than we ever have been before.\u201d",
      "During Trump\u2019s first term in office, Gabbard strongly criticized his handling of Iran and his decision to pull the United States out of a 2015 nuclear agreement that imposed limits on Tehran\u2019s nuclear work in return for an easing of sanctions.",
      "If Trump decides to order military strikes on Iran amid talk by Israel that military pressure might cause the Tehran regime to collapse, Gabbard would find herself in an awkward political position. She has vowed to ensure America no longer engages in \u201cregime change\u201d wars.",
      "Gabbard\u2019s being warmly welcomed into Trump\u2019s MAGA political base during the last presidential election was seen at the time as an injection of ideological diversity.",
      "A Trump administration official acknowledged that the heterodox views that made her a welcome addition to the MAGA movement now mark her as an outsider in an administration appearing to coalesce around a policy antithetical to those views.",
      "\u201cIf you adopt a Chihuahua, you should not be surprised that you have a Chihuahua,\u201d the person said."

    "summary": "More than a million people who were granted legal entry to the country under different programs are now being considered illegally here by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Florndjie Camey, 31, had gone from a bleak future in Haiti to hope for a new life; she had landed a cashier\u2019s job in her new city of Miami after coming to the country legally with a sponsor. Then, President Donald Trump declared that she and more than 1 million other people did not have legal permission to stay in the country.",
      "Trump, seeking to go down in history as the president who carried out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history, deemed that the Biden administration program that allowed Camey and hundreds of thousands of others to legally enter the U.S was actually illegal.",
      "Trump has pledged to clear the country of people who are illegally here, but the new criteria is expected to significantly expand the pool of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for the definition of \u2018self-fulling prophesy,\u2019 look no further than Trump\u2019s stream of policies that intentionally take legal status away from people so they go from being documented, to undocumented and then are fair game for being deported,\u201d said Angela Kelley, an adviser at the American Immigration Law Center and a former senior adviser on immigration for the Department of Homeland Security under the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is creating a larger class of undocumented people by literally de-legalizing them and taking away their work authorization early,\u201d Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, said in a statement.",
      "By \u201cdelegalizing\u201d Camey and others, Trump has drastically hiked the number of people who could be deported through a sped-up process, while helping his administration meet its goal of ridding the country of 1 million immigrants a year.",
      "\u201cWhat happened to his promise of targeting criminals? He\u2019s had to create larger numbers of targets and even then, the folks aren\u2019t criminals, because they\u2019re here legally,\u201d Kelley said.",
      "On May 30, the Supreme Court allowed the administration to strip more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela (CHNV) of the permission they were given to live and work in the U.S. temporarily through the CHNV parole program.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has issued a notice saying that the administration has terminated the parole and authorization to work for those in the CHNV program directed them to \u201cself-deport\u201d immediately.",
      "Immigration groups have contested the administration\u2019s assertion that the Biden program is unlawful. Guerline Jozef, executive director and founder of Haitian Bridge Alliance, said in a statement that hundreds of thousands in that program had trusted the U.S. government and had undergone extended vetting to secure lawful status. \u201cNow they are having the rug violently pulled out from under them,\u201d Jozef said.",
      "The Trump administration has stated that the humanitarian parole granted through the CHNV program didn\u2019t sufficiently improve border security and made interior enforcement more difficult. It argues that parole was meant to be more narrowly used. When the Supreme Court allowed Trump to terminate the CHNV program, the administration said in a statement that the participants were \u201cpoorly vetted\u201d and were given opportunities to compete for American jobs. The Trump administration said the programs were promoted despite fraud within them.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security referred NBC News to the same statement in response to a request for additional comment.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said, \"President Trump promised to restore sanity to America\u2019s immigration system and end Biden\u2019s dangerous policies that let countless unvetted aliens enter the United States. Terminating the CHNV Parole is a key part of fulfilling that promise. Parole, a temporary benefit, is granted case by case for urgent humanitarian reasons or public benefit \u2014 it is not a pathway to permanent residence or citizenship. This program was exploited by bad actors, undercut American workers, and encouraged more illegal immigration.\u201d",
      "Steve Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for immigration restrictions, supports the administration's actions. Perpetuating previous parole policies \u201cis creating the situation that caused the border crisis\u201d under Biden, Camarota said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t move to end them, then you are not very serious about dealing with this reality.\u201d",
      "Critics of Trump\u2019s policies point out that while the administration has focused on more deportations, it hasn\u2019t expanded the number of visas or other mechanisms to legally bring workers into the country or to legalize immigrants who\u2019ve spent years trying to adjust their immigration status. The business and the agricultural communities have called for more visas and ways to help legalize immigrants in order to expand the pool of workers needed in a number of industries and to keep a viable labor force amid a decline in U.S. birth rates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just seen no effort to improve legal pathways and, if anything, things have gotten worse,\u201d said Stuart Anderson, executive director for the National Foundation for American Policy, a public policy group focused on trade, immigration and related issues.",
      "Anderson noted Trump has made vague comments about legal pathways, such as his suggestion that some agricultural and hotel workers could leave the country and return if their employers\u2019 vouched for them. The administration had paused raids involving those workers, but DHS reversed that decision this week.",
      "Meanwhile, the administration has instituted travel bans on a number of countries. For people from Haiti, there is essentially a complete ban on travel to the U.S., with bans on temporary visas and immigrant visas, he said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve done nothing to make it easier to get visas and made it harder in many areas, including student visas,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "In Haiti, Camey was working to help youth in need and had returned to school to finish her university studies in psychology.  But she saw no future for her and her young daughter and no chance to build a life.",
      "She was living in rural Fort Libert\u00e9, in the northern part of the country, where violence was not as bad as in Port-au-Prince but where gangs were beginning to extend their reach, she told NBC News in her native Creole.",
      "\u201cI felt like I was just existing. There was no future \u2014 you can\u2019t build anything, not even save enough to buy a car. Some people had it even worse \u2014 no food or shelter ... There is truly no future,\u201d she said.",
      "Camey was sponsored to come to the U.S. by her aunt, making it possible for her to work in the U.S. and also support her daughter and family in Haiti.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a second chance at life. I\u2019m someone who likes to work and has strong willpower. It was a new experience and a new beginning,\u201d Camey said.",
      "Expanding the undocumented pool",
      "Because the CHNV parole program is temporary \u2014 good for up to two years \u2014 legally vetted immigrants like Camey and others would have to find other possible ways, such as Temporary Protected Status (TPS) or asylum, to remain in the country.",
      "But those other routes might also be difficult. In addition to terminating parole for the hundreds of thousands in the CHNV program, Trump has been trying to revoke the TPS of 350,000 Venezuelan immigrants.",
      "He\u2019s targeted nearly 300,000 more people from Afghanistan, Cameroon and Haiti who also were granted TPS, which grants protection from deportation and eligibility for work authorization for about six to 18 months and is extendable.",
      "More than 900,000 people given permission to come into the country through the Biden administration\u2019s CBP One app also have been told to leave the country. Many who entered using the app have asylum claims or are TPS recipients. Some who used the app have been arrested and detained and some have been shipped to El Salvador\u2019s notoriously brutal mega prison CECOT.",
      "The administration has gone further and wants to yank American citizenship from some people who don\u2019t have at least one U.S. citizen or legal resident parent. According to the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington think tank, ending birthright citizenship for children with unauthorized parents or other noncitizens, such as those temporarily here, \u201cwould significantly swell the size of the unauthorized population \u2014 now and for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Specifically, the Trump plan for ending birthright citizenship would increase the unauthorized population by 2.7 million by 2045 and by 5.4 million by 2075, according to a Migration Policy Institute-Penn State analysis. Every year for 50 years, about 255,000 children born in the U.S. would start life without U.S. citizenship, according to MPI-Penn State\u2019s analysis.",
      "Temporary, not permanent",
      "Noting that Trump\u2019s actions are being challenged in court, Camarota said the Trump administration learned from the president\u2019s first term in the White House that \u201cyou may prevail in court, but you better start now\u201d in trying to remove people who the administration believes should not have been granted entry.",
      "He added that the parole and TPS programs that are meant to be temporary don\u2019t often end up being temporary \u201cand that\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to undo.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not absurd that the longer people are here, they do have more of a claim on our conscience, but that is what we are trying to avoid,\u201d Camarota said. In the end, he added, the goal is to encourage people to leave.",
      "Faced with the prospect of having to return to Haiti, five Haitians who used the Biden parole program to come to the U.S. and were sponsored by Rivly Breus of Miami have relocated to Canada. Others may go to Chile and a few will go to Mexico or the Virgin Islands, Breus said.",
      "When the CHNV program opened, Breus and nine other people created a \u201csponsor circle\u201d to individually sponsor families. They used their own earnings to initially clothe, house, feed and support them as they found jobs and settled in. They also pooled money to create an emergency fund. In all, the individuals in the circle sponsored 30 people, Breus said.",
      "The end of the CHNV program \u201csaddens me,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not that these people want to leave their homeland,\u201d Breus  said. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of survival. These people have been trying to survive their entire lives. A lot of them don\u2019t want to give up because giving up means death for them or just being in a position where there is nothing to live for.\u201d",
      "Camey, who has filed for Temporary Protected Status, has no other option now but to go to a different country, Breus said.",
      "\u201cI would never stay (here) undocumented,\u201d Camey said. \u201cAll I know is I won\u2019t go back to Haiti.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to sell the short-form video app to an American owner by another 90 days.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order granting a third extension for the Chinese company to sell its platform so it can continue to operate in the United States.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025). Thank you for your attention to this matter!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "A statement from TikTok read: \"We are grateful for President Trump\u2019s leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President [JD] Vance\u2019s Office.\"",
      "While aboard Air Force One on Wednesday morning, Trump said he believed Chinese President Xi Jinping would be amenable toward a deal to sell the wildly popular app. Trump said he believed Xi would have to sign off on a deal if a buyer comes forward. ByteDance is based in Beijing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the administration wanted to ensure that Americans could continue to access TikTok.",
      "\u201cAs he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "TikTok has 170 million users in the U.S. and support for a ban has declined, according to Pew Research Center. A law banning TikTok initially passed under the Biden administration over national security concerns, which led the app to briefly go offline ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration earlier this year.",
      "However, once Trump signaled he planned to keep the app running in the U.S., TikTok resumed functioning.",
      "TikTok has denied that it posed any security concerns to the United States and said American data is not stored in China. After the TikTok ban passed last year, American users began flocking to Chinese social media app RedNote claiming they were indifferent to China accessing their data. Since TikTok was given an extension in the U.S., it appears users have returned to the platform and are using RedNote less.",
      "Once in office, Trump signed an extension of the deadline to sell the app, giving ByteDance 75 days to find a buyer. That extension ended April 5. Ahead of the April 5 deadline, some potential TikTok suitors expressed interest in purchasing the app. Amazon made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Others who expressed interest included Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who joined billionaire investor Frank McCourt\u2019s bid; artificial intelligence search engine startup Perplexity AI; and Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary in the first Trump administration.",
      "Top Trump officials were confident the app would sell but after sweeping tariffs were placed on China, no deal was made. Trump then gave the app another 90 days, which was set to expire Thursday.",
      "Under the law, ByteDance must sell TikTok to a U.S.-based buyer. ByteDance previously said it would not sell TikTok and has been quiet on whether it has decided to make a deal.",
      "The position to keep TikTok in the U.S. is an about-face from Trump\u2019s first term, during which he signed an executive order banning it. That ban was later overturned by the courts.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the Biden era law banning the app unless it is sold to an American owner."

    "summary": "Kennedy champions raw milk and criticizes federal health officials for their stance, but he's yet to relax rules or reverse warnings against drinking it.",
    "story": [
      "When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. became health and human services secretary, advocates for raw milk were thrilled to have one of their own at the helm in Washington. A self-professed fan of the drink, Kennedy had included raw milk in a list of foods and drugs that he felt federal officials had unfairly suppressed.",
      "\u201cFDA\u2019s war on public health is about to end,\u201d he wrote shortly after the November election.",
      "But Kennedy hasn\u2019t actively taken up the cause yet \u2014 even amid his sweeping effort to upend federal health agencies and his Make America Healthy Again campaign to change how Americans eat, frustrating and concerning some of the most prominent raw milk advocates.",
      "Federal officials have long warned that raw milk is unsafe for drinking because it hasn\u2019t gone through the heat process of pasteurization that kills off harmful bacteria, and sales across state lines have been banned since 1987.",
      "Kennedy helped champion and elevate raw milk and has criticized resistance from health officials, but he has yet to relax federal rules or reverse warnings against drinking it. His inaction so far is in contrast to his campaigns against childhood vaccines and artificial food dyes, longtime causes now at the center of his efforts as secretary.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services didn\u2019t respond to questions seeking comment about Kennedy\u2019s plans.",
      "Mark McAfee, one of the country\u2019s leading raw milk producers, had expected to advise Kennedy\u2019s department on ways to support raw milk farmers and expand access to consumers and hoped to help reverse the federal government\u2019s official stance that raw milk is too risky to consume. McAfee said he had been in close touch with Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy\u2019s presidential running mate, who interviewed him for a video she produced about raw milk.",
      "McAfee said that Kennedy texted him in February, shortly after his confirmation, that he would be in touch \u2014 but that there has been silence since then. A recent federal report on children\u2019s health commissioned by President Donald Trump \u2014 titled \u201cThe MAHA Report\u201d\u2014 stressed the importance of whole milk and other unprocessed foods but made no mention of raw milk, even though Kennedy celebrated its release by doing shots of raw milk at the White House with a leading health influencer last month.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration\u2019s stance that \u201craw milk puts all consumers at risk\u201d because of potential contamination hasn\u2019t been changed or updated, nor has the federal ban on selling it across state lines. And when McAfee recently reached out to the FDA for a meeting, he was rebuffed.",
      "\u201cIt appears that the FDA culture will continue its war against raw milk,\u201d McAfee said.",
      "There\u2019s a long-standing consensus among U.S. public health agencies that pasteurization is an essential step to kill bacteria in milk \u2014 one of the most important mainstays of the American diet, especially for children. Then again, there\u2019s also consensus that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism and that they\u2019re necessary for public health and safety, and that hasn\u2019t stopped Kennedy from raising the issue.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had this message, all of these decades, that raw milk is dangerous,\u201d said Judith McGeary, executive director of the Farm and Ranch Alliance in Texas, which has advocated for expanding access to raw milk. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to change overnight, no matter who\u2019s in charge.\u201d",
      "Meghan Davis, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, said the federal warnings and restrictions on selling raw milk have been in place for good reason. \u201cHumans drank raw milk for a long time, but they got diseases from it for a long time,\u201d said Davis, a former dairy veterinarian. \u201cRaw milk is among the more risky of the foodstuffs that we can consume.\u201d",
      "Without pasteurization, which heats milk to high temperatures, raw milk is likelier to transmit dangerous pathogens like E. coli, salmonella, listeria and campylobacter, Davis said.",
      "But raw milk advocates like McAfee argue that the risks have been overstated and the health and nutritional benefits have been undersold, arguing that consuming raw milk provides healthy gut bacteria, decreases asthma and allergies and strengthens our immune systems \u2014 all claims the FDA challenged in a post last year about \u201craw milk misconceptions.\u201d",
      "Peg Coleman, a raw milk advocate and former Agriculture Department microbiologist, argues that a \u201cpro-pasteurization bias\u201d remains entrenched in federal agencies and wants Kennedy\u2019s Health and Human Services Department to take down such information.",
      "But even despite the persistence of such warnings, \u201cthere is the demand,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople are still choosing raw milk.\u201d",
      "Like many of the other health trends and beliefs that Kennedy has embraced, raw milk was once considered a fringe health food associated with the new-age left that has transformed into a signifier of the right \u2014 a mainstay of the MAHA health influencers in Kennedy\u2019s orbit and a rallying cry for conservatives who have pushed states to legalize raw milk sales and oppose government crackdowns on unlicensed raw milk producers.",
      "Small farmers, especially, have successfully lobbied both blue and red states to legalize sales as a way to diversify their offerings, overcoming major opposition from the pasteurized milk industry.",
      "But the sale of raw milk remains banned across state lines. And even though new state laws have expanded access and expanded raw milk production, sales remain highly restricted in most states: Only 14 permit retail sales to consumers. In many others, consumers must buy it on site from farms. And state health officials typically look to federal health agencies for guidance about safety.",
      "While some states have their own safety rules and testing requirements for raw milk, there are no federal standards or guidance for producers.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that from 1998 to 2018, drinking raw milk was linked to 2,645 illnesses and 228 hospitalizations. The agency also found that outbreaks linked to unpasteurized dairy products are far more likely than those linked to pasteurized dairy.",
      "While the overall numbers are low compared with other raw foods like oysters and leafy greens, such foods are consumed far more widely.",
      "Davis added that more research is necessary to prove that specific standards or testing protocols are effective at making raw milk safe or safer to consume. \u201cWe have to do that study,\u201d she said.",
      "McAfee\u2019s own raw milk has been subject to multiple voluntary recalls, as well as outbreaks of foodborne illness. California officials linked raw milk from his company, Raw Farm, to dozens of salmonella cases in 2023. McAfee said the company has since strengthened its testing protocols and created an on-site pathogen lab to prevent future problems.",
      "\u201cWe learned from that incident,\u201d he said. \u201cWe owned that we had a problem, and we fixed it.\u201d Last year, the company also issued a recall after its raw milk tested positive for bird flu but said its products were never associated with any infections.",
      "McAfee says that proper guidelines and testing can make raw milk safe to drink \u2014 and that the federal government has an important role to play in establishing safety standards. He drafted a proposal for the FDA to develop standards and guidance for raw milk producers, which he sent to the agency after Kennedy became health and human services secretary.",
      "\u201cWe are not looking for the FDA to regulate raw milk, but we would love to have the best FDA scientists in the world acknowledge the benefits of raw milk, if it is produced under the High Standards that we will discuss,\u201d McAfee wrote in a recent email to FDA officials that he shared with NBC News.",
      "The FDA turned him down. \u201cGiven our need to balance agency priorities, the Human Foods Program respectfully declines your request for a meeting at this time, though we remain open to dialogue with the raw milk industry,\u201d Donald Prater, principal deputy director of the FDA\u2019s Human Foods Program, wrote in response.",
      "The FDA didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "Kelsey Barefoot of Dunn, North Carolina, who became a raw milk producer in 2021, said, \u201cIt\u2019s our basic human right to be able to have the freedom to choose our food.\u201d As a former critical care nurse, Barefoot was taught about the dangers of raw milk, but she said she was won over after she tried it herself.",
      "\u201cI had been prepared to think that raw milk was going to kill me,\u201d Barefoot said. \u201cI started drinking it. I loved it. I didn\u2019t die, and my kids drank it, and so I started producing the milk for myself.\u201d",
      "She now works for the Raw Milk Institute, founded by McAfee, which seeks to support \u201clow-risk raw milk production\u201d through safety standards and testing protocols, including test results that are publicly posted.",
      "The advocates haven\u2019t given up on Kennedy, bolstered by the MAHA movement\u2019s push to eradicate food dyes and other top concerns. It may just take more time for him to come around, McAfee said. \u201cIt\u2019s really, really crowded with people trying to saturate him. He\u2019s trying to sort things out.\u201d",
      "Sally Fallon Morell, founding president of the Weston A. Price Foundation, a nonprofit alternative nutrition organization, said she first spoke with Kennedy about milk in 2021, when she was seated next to him at the foundation's annual holistic health conference, held that year in Texas.",
      "She said Kennedy recalled drinking raw milk when he was a child and said he wished he were drinking it again but wasn\u2019t sure where to find it. Morell directed him to a website her foundation had set up, which had a searchable database of raw milk purveyors. The following year, Kennedy was invited to speak at the same conference.",
      "\u201cSince I was here last year, I only drink raw milk,\u201d he said from the stage. The audience burst into applause."

    "story": [
      "PUERTO ESCONDIDO, Mexico \u2014 Hurricane Erick made landfall early Thursday on the Pacific coast of Mexico as a major Category 3 storm, the National Hurricane Center said.",
      "Erick made landfall after 6 a.m. CT in extreme western Oaxaca, just east of Punta Maldonado, with estimated maximum sustained winds near 125 mph, the center reported.",
      "It had rapidly intensified from a Category 1 hurricane yesterday to an \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d Category 4 storm with sustained winds of 146 mph.",
      "A major hurricane is defined as Category 3 or higher and wind speeds of at least 111 mph.",
      "The storm is moving northwest at nearly 9 mph, the hurricane center said in its 7 a.m. ET update.",
      "The center of the hurricane is forecast to move inland over southern Mexico throughout the day. Erick is forecast to rapidly weaken over the mountains of Mexico and dissipate Thursday night or early Friday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Erick will produce 8 to 12 inches of rainfall, with maximum totals of 16 inches, across the Oaxaca and Guerrero states, that will lead to \u201clife-threatening flooding and mudslides,\u201d the hurricane center said. Destructive winds will also lash out near Erick\u2019s core and dangerous, life-threatening storm surge is expected to produce coastal flooding.",
      "Videos on social media early Thursday showed staggering flash flooding with streets overwhelmed by rushing floodwaters and people walking in knee-deep water.",
      "A major hurricane making landfall on this part of Mexico in June is very rare. Erick is the earliest major hurricane to make landfall on Mexico's Pacific coast.",
      "Storm moves south on approach",
      "Late Wednesday, Erick\u2019s projected path crept south, closer to the resort city of Puerto Escondido in Oaxaca state, and centered on a sparsely populated stretch of coastline between the Oaxacan resort and Acapulco to the northwest.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in a video message Wednesday night that all activities in the region were suspended and she urged people to stay in their homes or to move to shelters if they live in low-lying areas.",
      "Waves were crashing onto the esplanade in Puerto Escondido by nightfall, swamping wooden fishing boats that had been pulled up there for safety. The beach disappeared under pounding waves and the rising tide had already reached the interiors of some waterfront restaurants.",
      "Last-minute purchases ended at nightfall as stores closed and the streets emptied.",
      "Earlier in the day, fishermen in Puerto Escondido pulled their boats out of the water ahead of the storm\u2019s arrival. Some surfers continued to ride waves at the Zicatela beach, even with red flags up to warn people to stay out of the water.",
      "The storm\u2019s course shift could be welcome relief for residents of storm-battered Acapulco.",
      "The city of nearly 1 million was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, a Category 5 hurricane that rapidly intensified and caught many unprepared. At least 52 people died in Otis and the storm severely damaged almost all of the resort\u2019s hotels.",
      "Acapulco still scarred by Otis",
      "Acapulco residents said they were bracing for Erick\u2019s arrival with more preparation and trepidation because of the memory of the devastation wrought by Otis two years earlier.",
      "Guerrero Gov. Evelyn Salgado said via X that all movement in Acapulco and other beach communities was to be suspended at 8 p.m. Schools across the state were to remain closed for a second day Thursday.",
      "Carlos Ozuna Romero, 51, lost his restaurant at the edge of an Acapulco beach when Otis slammed the resort with devastating winds. On Wednesday, he directed workers storing tables and chairs.",
      "\u201cAuthorities\u2019 warnings fill us with fear and obviously make us remember everything we\u2019ve already been through,\u201d Ozuna Romero said in reference to Otis.",
      "Elsewhere, workers nailed sheets of plywood over shop windows and stacked sandbags outside doorways. Cars lined up to fill their tanks and shoppers made last-minute purchases before rushing home.",
      "Ver\u00f3nica G\u00f3mez struggled through the streets of Acapulco with a large jug of water. \u201cWe\u2019re all afraid because we think the same thing could happen,\u201d said the 40-year-old employee of a shipping company.",
      "But she said she and others learned a lot from Otis. \u201cNow it\u2019s not going to catch us by surprise,\u201d she said, holding out a bag of canned food as evidence.",
      "In Acapulco on Wednesday, there was a strong presence of the national guard and police in the streets, but most visible were trucks from the national power company. Crews worked to clear drainage canals and brush.",
      "Rain could be Erick\u2019s legacy",
      "Forecasters said Erick was expected to lash Mexico\u2019s Pacific coast with heavy rain, strong winds and a fierce storm surge. Rain of up to 16 inches could fall across the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Guerrero, with lesser totals in Chiapas, Michoacan, Colima and Jalisco states, the hurricane center\u2019s advisory said. The rainfall threatened flooding and mudslides, especially in areas with steep terrain.",
      "A hurricane warning is in effect for Acapulco to Puerto Angel, a hurricane watch in effect for west of Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana, and tropical storm warning in effect east of Puerto Angel to Salina Cruz and west of Acapulco to Tecpan de Galeana.",
      "Laura Vel\u00e1zquez, Mexico\u2019s national civil defense coordinator, said Erick was forecast to bring \u201ctorrential\u201d rains to Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas in southern Mexico. The mountainous region along the coast is especially prone to mudslides with numerous rivers at risk of flooding.",
      "Salgado said the state had alerted all of the fishing and tourism operators to make their boats storm-ready. Acapulco\u2019s port closed Tuesday evening. Salgado said 582 shelters were set to receive people who might evacuate their homes.",
      "Having doubled in strength in less than a day, Erick was churning through an ideal environment for quick intensification. Last year, there were 34 incidents of rapid intensification \u2014 when a storm gains at least 35 mph in 24 hours \u2014 which is about twice as many as average and causes problems with forecasting, according to the hurricane center."

      "\u201cA shark injury is both a curse and a blessing. In this case, because the shark\u2019s teeth are so sharp, the cut through the wrist is clean and not jagged. It doesn\u2019t ruin all the tissue. So, we have good tissue to work with and put it back together in a timely fashion,\u201d Hess said.",
      "Timing was of the essence for doctors to save Leah's hand. Dr. Joshua Linnell, another orthopedic surgeons who treated Leah, said the key is to see patients \"before the six hour mark\" because after that \"they start losing muscle tissue.\"",

      "Earlier this month, the Defense Department told transgender service members that they had to choose whether they would voluntarily or involuntarily separate from the military.",
      "Four trans service members who are now in the process of separating said nothing about their decisions feels voluntary at all.",
      "\u201cNobody feels like this is voluntary,\u201d said Emily Shilling, a commander in the Navy and the president of SPARTA, a nonprofit group that advocates for trans service members. \u201cThis is coercion. This is under duress.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order a week into his administration prohibiting trans people from enlisting or serving in the military. Trans service members sued, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the order from taking effect. Then, last month, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to enforce the order. Days later, the Defense Department issued guidance requiring active duty service members to voluntarily self-identify as having been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, which is the distress that results from a misalignment between one\u2019s birth sex and gender identity, by June 6 and reserve service members to self-identify by July 7.",
      "After that, the guidance said, the military will find trans service members who didn\u2019t self-identify through medical readiness programs and begin involuntarily separating them. Affected service members \u201care eligible for an array of benefits,\u201d the guidance said, including separation pay, \u201cwhich will be higher for those who self-identify and agree to a voluntary separation.\u201d",
      "However, many details are still unknown, such as what benefits trans service members will be able to access and whether they will all receive honorable discharges. It\u2019s also unclear how many service members will be affected. Just over 4,000 transgender people currently serve in the military, according to Defense Department data, and the department said last month that about 1,000 trans service members have begun the separation process from the military after voluntarily identifying themselves. The department said Tuesday that it does not have an updated number of affected service members.",
      "\u201cCharacterization of service will be honorable except where the Service member\u2019s record otherwise warrants a lower characterization,\u201d a U.S. Defense official said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cMilitary Services will follow normal processes for administrative separation.\u201d",
      "The four trans service members who spoke to NBC News all emphasized that they are speaking in their personal capacity and not on behalf of their respective branches. The biggest question they all face is what comes next.",
      "Bree Fram",
      "On June 30, 2016, the day then-Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that transgender people could serve openly in the military, Bree Fram, who was then a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force, came out to her teammates in an email as a trans woman and then went to burn off her nerves at the gym.",
      "When she returned to her desk later, she said her colleagues approached her one by one, shook her hand, and told her a version of \u201cIt\u2019s an honor to serve with you.\u201d",
      "Fram, who is 46 and now a colonel for the U.S. Space Force at the Pentagon, said that scene repeated earlier this month with leaders from other branches of the military when she told them it would be her last meeting with them. An officer sitting next to her asked where she was going, and she said, \u201cI\u2019m being placed on administrative leave because I don\u2019t meet this administration\u2019s standards for military excellence and readiness.\u201d",
      "Fram said there was a moment of silence before it seemed like her colleagues realized which policy she was referring to \u2014 because, she said, trans service members don\u2019t \u201cwalk into a room and lead with our identity.\u201d",
      "\u201cI walk into a room and someone sees a colonel, and they see the uniform, and they see all the things that represents about my experience and my expertise,\u201d said Fram, who is one of the highest-ranking out trans officials in the military.",
      "Then, Fram said her colleagues walked over, one by one, and shook her hand and said, again, that it had been an honor to serve with her.",
      "Fram, who served for 22 years until she was placed on administrative leave on June 6, was the director of requirements integration for the Space Force. She helped to identify future technological capabilities the military will need and provided those to developers who built them. She said she planned to serve \u201cfor many years to come,\u201d because she loved her job and the team that she worked with.",
      "Fram said she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019ll do next, but she expects she\u2019ll work in public service.",
      "\u201cI believe in this country, even though it may not believe in me right now,\u201d Fram said. \u201cThe oath I swore and the ideals that are embedded in the Constitution still matter to me, and I believe they are worth fighting for.\u201d",
      "Sam Rodriguez",
      "Sam Rodriguez, 38, was recently commissioned as a Medical Service Corps officer in the Navy and was supposed to begin officer training school and then a two-year clinical fellowship in San Diego to become a licensed clinical social worker. However, about a week after the Supreme Court decision allowing the trans military ban to take effect, Rodriguez, who uses they/them pronouns, said the Navy canceled those orders.",
      "\u201cIt was really gut-wrenching to receive that news,\u201d Rodriguez said. They enlisted in 2015 and planned to serve for 15 or 20 years, when they would\u2019ve left the Navy as an experienced licensed social worker. However, now they will leave with their master\u2019s degree in social work, and they will have to look for an employer who is willing to provide supervision for them to receive their clinical license, which will be more difficult.",
      "They submitted their resignation earlier this month and requested a separation date in the fall. They said they don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to find an entry-level job as a civilian that\u2019s going to match their current salary, housing allowance, health care benefits and the stipend that they and their wife get to pay for child care for their two children.",
      "They plan to move their family from San Diego to Washington, D.C., so they can become more involved in policy advocacy. Outside of work, they are a board member and membership director for SPARTA.",
      "\u201cPeople need to realize that this is a national security issue,\u201d Rodriguez said, pointing to research from the Modern Military Association of America, an advocacy group for LGBTQ military members and veterans, which found that 73% of trans service members have between 12 and 21 years of experience.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not going to be one-for-one swapped tomorrow, and some people it will take two decades to replace,\u201d they said.",
      "Emily Shilling",
      "Shilling, 42, is the highest-ranking out trans person in the Navy after having served for nearly two decades, including in over 60 combat missions in Iraq and Afghanistan. She was also one of the lead plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the administration\u2019s ban.",
      "After Trump was elected, she requested to retire in the fall. Her intention was to rescind that retirement because she expected that the ban on trans troops serving would be blocked, but with the policy taking effect, her last day was June 12, and she will officially retire in September.",
      "\u201cI am deeply heartbroken that this is how my career has ended, but also deeply proud of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Shilling said. \u201cI lived my dream. I did everything I ever wanted to in the Navy and I did it honorably, and I stood proud. I might be getting out of the Navy, but it\u2019s not me quitting this fight. I\u2019m just choosing to take on this fight in a different way.\u201d",
      "Shilling said the Navy invested $40 million in training her, and as a result she has many desirable skills and has already accepted an offer to work in defense technologies and advanced development. However, she said her story is rare among trans service members, thousands of whom will be looking for private sector jobs for the first time.",
      "Shilling said the lawsuit against the ban will return to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals for a hearing in October, but by that time, most trans service members will be out of the military.",
      "\u201cThe irreparable harm is done now,\u201d she said.",
      "Alex Shaffer",
      "Alex Shaffer, 48, joined the military as a combat medic in the Oregon Army National Guard in 2007. His mentors in the guard convinced him to go to school to become a physician\u2019s assistant, and he now also works in a private family practice as a PA.",
      "\u201cIn all of the military, it\u2019s a family,\u201d Shaffer said of what he\u2019s enjoyed about serving in the guard.",
      "Shaffer said he planned to stay in the guard \u201cuntil I could no longer physically serve or they kicked me out for being too old.\u201d He was in the process of trying to commission as an officer. However, his last drill was June 7, because he began the process to medically separate from the National Guard as a result of the ban. (The National Guard only provides retirement benefits to service members if a medical evaluation board deems them physically unfit for duty.)",
      "\u201cI\u2019m devastated,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cIt\u2019s a loss of identity to me. I\u2019ve been a soldier for so long, and it\u2019s a part of who I am.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump ripped into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him \u201cdestructive,\u201d after the central bank kept interest rates steady on Wednesday.",
      "Trump said \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell is costing the United States \u201chundreds of billions of dollars\u201d by not cutting rates, leveling a familiar criticism against the Fed chair who has repeatedly ignored Trump\u2019s pressure campaign to cut rates.",
      "\u201cWe should be 2.5 Points lower, and save $BILLIONS on all of Biden\u2019s Short Term Debt,\u201d Trump wrote Thursday on Truth Social.",
      "Trump also criticized Powell late Wednesday, calling him a \u201creal dummy\u201d in a near-midnight Truth Social post.",
      "Powell, whose term ends in May of 2026, said Wednesday that, \u201cfor the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policies.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s remarks were in response to the Federal Open Market Committee keeping its borrowing rate targeted in a range between 4.25%-4.5%, which is on par with where it\u2019s been since December.",
      "The criticisms were not surprising, as the president has long slammed Powell for not lowering interest rates.",
      "As recently as Wednesday morning, hours before the Fed was set to release its decision on interest rates, Trump said: \u201cSo we have a stupid person. Frankly, you probably won\u2019t cut today.\u201d",
      "\u201cEurope had 10 cuts, and we had none. And I guess he\u2019s a political guy, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s a political guy who\u2019s not a smart person, but he\u2019s costing the country a fortune,\u201d he said outside the White House.",
      "Trump even mused about appointing himself to lead the Federal Reserve, saying, \u201cI\u2019d do a much better job than these people.\u201d",
      "Trump has said that he intends to announce his pick for the next chair of the Federal Reserve \u201cvery soon.\u201d",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to sell the short-form video app to an American owner by another 90 days",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok\u2019s parent company, ByteDance, to sell the short-form video app to an American owner by another 90 days.",
      "On Thursday, Trump signed an executive order granting a third extension for the Chinese company to sell its platform so it can continue to operate in the United States.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve just signed the Executive Order extending the Deadline for the TikTok closing for 90 days (September 17, 2025). Thank you for your attention to this matter!\u201d Trump said on Truth Social.",
      "A statement from TikTok read: \"We are grateful for President Trump\u2019s leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President [JD] Vance\u2019s Office.\"",
      "While aboard Air Force One on Wednesday morning, Trump said he believed Chinese President Xi Jinping would be amenable toward a deal to sell the wildly popular app. Trump said he believed Xi would have to sign off on a deal if a buyer comes forward. ByteDance is based in Beijing.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the administration wanted to ensure that Americans could continue to access TikTok.",
      "\u201cAs he has said many times, President Trump does not want TikTok to go dark. This extension will last 90 days, which the administration will spend working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "TikTok has 170 million users in the U.S. and support for a ban has declined, according to Pew Research Center. A law banning TikTok initially passed under the Biden administration over national security concerns, which led the app to briefly go offline ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration earlier this year.",
      "However, once Trump signaled he planned to keep the app running in the U.S., TikTok resumed functioning.",
      "TikTok has denied that it posed any security concerns to the United States and said American data is not stored in China. After the TikTok ban passed last year, American users began flocking to Chinese social media app RedNote claiming they were indifferent to China accessing their data. Since TikTok was given an extension in the U.S., it appears users have returned to the platform and are using RedNote less.",
      "Once in office, Trump signed an extension of the deadline to sell the app, giving ByteDance 75 days to find a buyer. That extension ended April 5. Ahead of the April 5 deadline, some potential TikTok suitors expressed interest in purchasing the app. Amazon made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok. Others who expressed interest included Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who joined billionaire investor Frank McCourt\u2019s bid; artificial intelligence search engine startup Perplexity AI; and Steven Mnuchin, treasury secretary in the first Trump administration.",
      "Top Trump officials were confident the app would sell but after sweeping tariffs were placed on China, no deal was made. Trump then gave the app another 90 days, which was set to expire Thursday.",
      "Under the law, ByteDance must sell TikTok to a U.S.-based buyer. ByteDance previously said it would not sell TikTok and has been quiet on whether it has decided to make a deal.",
      "The position to keep TikTok in the U.S. is an about-face from Trump\u2019s first term, during which he signed an executive order banning it. That ban was later overturned by the courts.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the Biden era law banning the app unless it is sold to an American owner."

      "Sabrina Carpenter fans may soon find themselves locking up their phones at her concerts after recent comments the singer-songwriter made to Rolling Stone.",
      "\u201cThis will honestly piss off my fans, but absolutely,\u201d Carpenter said when asked about the possibility of requiring concert-goers to drop their phones into pouches during her shows.",
      "The \u201cEspresso\u201d singer said that her opinion on having phones at concerts changed after she attended a Silk Sonic concert in Las Vegas at which she had to lock up her own phone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never had a better experience at a concert,\u201d Carpenter said.",
      "\u201cI genuinely felt like I was back in the Seventies \u2014 wasn\u2019t alive. Genuinely felt like I was there. Everyone\u2019s singing, dancing, looking at each other, and laughing. It really, really just felt so beautiful.\u201d",
      "Appearing on the latest cover of the magazine, Carpenter weighed in on a variety of topics including why she released a new album so soon after \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d her new single \u201cManchild,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as the intense scrutiny she and many other women face.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to be pessimistic, but I truly feel like I\u2019ve never lived in a time where women have been picked apart more, and scrutinized in every capacity. I\u2019m not just talking about me. I\u2019m talking about every female artist that is making art right now \u2026. We\u2019re in such a weird time where you would think it\u2019s girl power, and women supporting women, but in reality, the second you see a picture of someone wearing a dress on a carpet, you have to say everything mean about it in the first 30 seconds that you see it,\u201d she told Rolling Stone.",
      "Carpenter\u2019s latest album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d recently made headlines for its provocative cover art, which was released on June 11. The image depicts the \u201cBed Chem\u201d singer wearing a black dress, on all fours next to a man\u2019s leg, with his hand clutching her hair.",
      "Fans took to the internet to weigh in, with some calling the art \u201cdisturbing\u201d and \u201cnot a very empowering image for women.\u201d However, others viewed the album cover as a nod to \u201chow women are regarded by certain men.\u201d",
      "As for constantly being commented on online, Carpenter told Rolling Stone, \u201cWhen you get down the little rabbit hole is truly when people start commenting on you as a person or you physically. All of those things that you\u2019re already thinking on a day-to-day basis. You don\u2019t need a stranger from Arkansas to remind you.\u201d"

      "For 19-year-old Emerson Colindres, it was supposed to be a routine check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. It turned out to be a trap. He never returned home.",
      "Colindres, who came to the United States with his family more than a decade ago to escape the violence in their native Honduras, was detained by ICE on June 4, just days after the talented student and soccer player graduated high school in Cincinnati. Colindres, whose teammates said was one of the greatest players they met on the field, dreamed of continuing his sports career and hoped to attend a university. He did not have a criminal record, according to the Butler County Sheriff\u2019s Office.",
      "In the span of two weeks, Colindres went from celebrating his graduation to being detained by ICE to then being deported to a country where he has not lived since he was 8 years old.",
      "He is not the only law-abiding high school student who has been targeted by ICE. Immigration enforcement around the country has also swept up students in New York City, as well as in Milford, Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cSadly, he\u2019s not the only one. I think there are a lot of Emersons in the same situation right now,\u201d Bryan Williams, Colindres\u2019 coach at the Cincy Galaxy soccer club, said ahead of the young man\u2019s deportation. \u201cThey\u2019re all the same story, someone who was here doing everything they were asked, trying to make a better life for themselves and their family, and now they\u2019re being detained somewhere.\u201d",
      "While President Donald Trump has long promised to enact mass deportations, the administration initially said it would focus on criminals and bad actors who were in the country illegally.",
      "But as pressure to increase deportations has grown, young people without criminal records \u2014 including teens like Colindres who have lived in the U.S. since they were children \u2014 have been caught up in immigration enforcement.",
      "Colindres\u2019 arrest did not go unnoticed.",
      "Protests erupted in the Cincinnati area and outside the detention center in Butler County, Ohio, where Colindres was, for a time, being held. His coach, teachers, classmates and teammates \u2014 all called for the release of a beloved teenager who they said was unfairly ripped away from their tight-knit community.",
      "On Wednesday, Colindres was deported.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s devastating,\u201d Johanna Froelicher, a middle school teacher who had Colindres as a student, told NBC News. \u201cBut we aren\u2019t giving up on him.\u201d",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary of public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, told NBC News \u201cwe are delivering on President Trump\u2019s and the American people\u2019s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens to make America safe.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin said that during the first 100 days of Trump's presidency, 75% of immigrants arrested had convictions or pending charges. According to reporting from Reuters, the top charges making up 39% of that total were traffic offenses or immigration-related crimes.",
      "A senior spokesperson with the Department of Homeland Security told NBC News that immigrants arrested during routine check-ins, \u201chad executable final orders of removal by an immigration judge and had not complied with that order. If you are in the country illegally and a judge has ordered you to be removed, that is precisely what will happen.\u201d",
      "After he was arrested, Colindres was spirited out to the Butler County jail, where Sheriff Richard Jones said about 450 immigrant detainees were being held after the sheriff\u2019s office agreed to partner with the Trump administration.",
      "On June 17, Colindres was taken from the jail and \u201cnone of us, including his family or legal team, have been informed where he was taken,\u201d Froelicher said ahead of his deportation.",
      "Jones said that Colindres never had any legal issues, and that he was given due process on his ability to stay in the U.S. through his immigration case. \u201cHe had a court order from a judge to be deported, and he was deported,\u201d he said.",
      "Williams said he was shocked by the turn of events.",
      "\u201cThese are your friends and neighbors,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey make your community what it is, and then one day they\u2019re just gone.\u201d",
      "Colindres arrived in the U.S. in 2014 with his mother and sister at a time when many Central American families were fleeing gang violence and extreme poverty in their home countries.",
      "\u201cIn Honduras, families have no security,\u201d Colindres\u2019 mother, Ada Bell Baquedano Amador, said in Spanish. \u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated situation.\u201d",
      "Seemingly safe in the U.S., her family filed for asylum and settled in Cincinnati. And while they waited for their immigration case to play out, they started rebuilding their lives.",
      "Colindres was a gifted student and \u201cand did amazing academically,\u201d said Froelicher, the middle school teacher who is now a family friend and supporter.",
      "When he wasn\u2019t hitting the books, Colindres was on the soccer pitch and quickly became a star player at a local soccer club. \u201cHe\u2019s continued to be beloved by anyone who came in contact with him,\u201d Froelicher said.",
      "Baquedano Amador said she is so grateful to have Colindres as her son.",
      "\u201cAs a mom, sometimes I don\u2019t even have words for how much I thank God for Emerson,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of him.\u201d",
      "The family\u2019s hopes for a future in the U.S. took a hit after an immigration judge denied their asylum application and in 2023 they were given a final order of removal, Baquedano Amador said.",
      "During the Biden administration, immigration officials were ordered to exercise discretion on a case-by-case basis and to prioritize deportation for immigrants with criminal convictions who were a threat to national or public safety.",
      "So instead of immediate deportation, Baquedano Amador was given an ankle monitor and ordered to check in with ICE.",
      "But after Trump took office in January, ICE began targeting immigrants with and without criminal histories, as well as those who entered the country legally through Biden-era programs and those with pending asylum cases.",
      "When Colindres came of age, he too was given a schedule to check in with ICE and told he too would soon have to don an ankle monitor, his mother said.",
      "Williams said to boost the morale of his star player, he started going with Colindres to his ICE check-in appointments. And June 4, he also brought along his wife and son.",
      "But Colindres was not allowed to return home that day, in a pattern seen around the nation of immigrants showing up for what were once routine appointments and being taken into ICE custody for deportation.",
      "\u201cThey took him out of the building in handcuffs,\u201d Williams said. \u201cMy son got to see him and give him a hug and tell him he loved him. But one of his good friends was in handcuffs being taken away and he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s ever going to see him again.\u201d",
      "McLaughlin said in a statement that Colindres had a final order of removal from 2023 and that \u201cif you are in the country illegally and a judge has ordered you to be removed, that is precisely what will happen.\u201d",
      "Froelicher said Colindres and his family are not the kind of migrants the Trump administration should be targeting.",
      "\u201cHe and his family have literally done every single thing that they have been asked,\u201d Froelicher said. \u201cThey have complied with everything because they\u2019re just such good people. They truly want to be here and they wanted to do things the right way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not just about policy,\u201d Froelicher added. \u201cThis is about human lives. These are real people with dreams and aspirations.\u201d",
      "Colindres' soccer teammates said they can\u2019t picture celebrating their graduations without him.",
      "\u201cHe is one of my closest friends,\u201d said 18-year-old Alejandro Pepole, who said he has known Colindres for about 10 years. \u201cEmerson has always been a very funny guy. I never saw him in a bad mood. Every time we hung out on or off the field, he was always uplifting people\u2019s moods and he always had a smile on his face. He was overall just a very good person and what he\u2019s going through right now just isn\u2019t right.\u201d",
      "Pepole said Colindres was an inspiration on the soccer field.",
      "Colindres, he said, \u201ccan just do everything as a player. He wins us games. He\u2019s like the main goal scorer. He controls the game. And he\u2019s just an overall good team leader as well.\u201d",
      "And Colindres was ambitious, his friends said.",
      "\u201cHe had a dream to play at the next level in soccer and eventually play professionally,\u201d Preston Robinson, 18, said. \u201cYou could tell by the amount of effort he put in and how good he was, it was definitely possible for him. We were trying to help him get to the next level for soccer, no matter what it took.\u201d",
      "Robinson said he was shocked when Colindres was arrested.",
      "\u201cHe was going there expecting to just have a check-in, like he was supposed to be doing, and then they took him away,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was almost like he got trapped, which just doesn\u2019t seem fair.\u201d"

      "A federal judge denied Blake Lively's request to keep some of her private text messages with Taylor Swift from Justin Baldoni, marking a major legal victory for the embattled \"It Ends with Us\" actor and director.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman deemed in a court filing on Wednesday that Baldoni's requests for some messages between Lively and Swift were permissible.",
      "Baldoni\u2019s legal team will only have access to text messages about \u201cIt Ends with Us,\u201d the judge ruled. Lively and Baldoni starred in the 2024 film, an adaptation of Colleen Hoover\u2019s best-selling romance novel \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d which is at the center of their ongoing legal battle.",
      "\"Given that Lively has represented that Swift had knowledge of complaints or discussions about the working environment on the film, among other issues, the requests for messages with Swift regarding the film and this action are reasonably tailored to discover information that would prove or disprove Lively\u2019s harassment and retaliation claims,\" the judge wrote.",
      "A representative for Lively denounced the judge's decision.",
      "\"Baldoni\u2019s desire to drag Taylor Swift into this has been constant dating back to August 2024 ... a strategy to influence the 'TS fanbase,'\" the spokesperson said.",
      "\"We will continue to call out Baldoni\u2019s relentless efforts to exploit Ms Swift\u2019s popularity, which from day one has been nothing more than a distraction from the serious sexual harassment and retaliation accusations he and the Wayfarer parties are facing,\" the spokesperson added, referring to the film's production company.",
      "Representatives for Swift and Baldoni did not immediately return requests for comment.",
      "Lively sued Baldoni and others associated with the film last year, alleging that Baldoni sexually harassed her and launched a public relations smear campaign to ruin her reputation. Baldoni has denied the allegations.",
      "Days later, Baldoni and Wayfarer Studios countersued Lively, her husband Ryan Reynolds and The New York Times \u2014 which reported details of the allegations \u2014 for defamation. That suit, which requested damages of $400 million, was dismissed in court last week.",

      "\"Given that her involvement was licensing a song for the film, which 19 other artists also did, this document subpoena is designed to use Taylor Swift\u2019s name to draw public interest by creating tabloid clickbait instead of focusing on the facts of the case,\u201d a spokesperson for Swift said at the time.",
      "Baldoni's request to subpoena Swift was dropped days later.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisers meet next week, but their agenda suggests they\u2019ll skip some expected topics \u2014 including a vote on Covid shots \u2014 while taking up a longtime target of anti-vaccine groups.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices makes recommendations on how to use the nation\u2019s vaccines, setting a schedule for children\u2019s vaccines, as well as advice for adult shots. Last week, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices.",
      "The agenda for the new committee\u2019s first meeting, posted Wednesday, shows it will be shorter than expected. Discussion of Covid shots will open the session, but the agenda lists no vote on that. Instead, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations, on RSV vaccinations for pregnant women and children and on the use of a preservative named thimerosal that\u2019s in a subset of flu shots.",
      "It\u2019s not clear who wrote the agenda. No committee chairperson has been named and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not comment.",
      "Committee won\u2019t take up HPV or meningococcal vaccines",
      "Missing from the agenda are some heavily researched vaccine policy proposals the advisers were supposed to consider this month, including shots against HPV and meningococcal bacteria, said Dr. Susan Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Instead, the committee is talking about subjects \u201cwhich are settled science,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cEvery American should be asking themselves how and why did we get here, where leaders are promoting their own agenda instead of protecting our people and our communities,\u201d she said. She worried it\u2019s \u201cpart of a purposeful agenda to insert dangerous and harmful and unnecessary fear regarding vaccines into the process.\u201d",
      "The committee makes recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC has no director and the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy.",
      "Thimerosal is a longtime target of anti-vaccine activists",
      "Thimerosal was added to certain vaccines in the early 20th century to make them safer and more accessible by preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials. It\u2019s a tiny amount, but because it\u2019s a form of mercury, it began raising questions in the 1990s.",
      "Kennedy \u2014 a leading voice in an anti-vaccine movement before he became President Donald Trump\u2019s health secretary \u2014 has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger.",
      "Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, all vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine.",
      "Thimerosal now only appears in multidose flu shot vials, not the single-shot packaging of most of today\u2019s flu shots.",
      "Targeting thimerosal would likely force manufacturers to switch to single-dose vials, which would make the shots \u201cmore expensive, less available and more feared,\u201d said Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia.",
      "Doctors\u2019 groups have opposed Kennedy\u2019s vaccine moves",
      "Last week, 30 organizations called on insurers to continue paying for Covid vaccines for pregnant women after Kennedy said the shots would no longer be routinely recommended for that group.",
      "Doctors\u2019 groups also opposed Kennedy\u2019s changes to the vaccine committee. The new members he picked include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of Covid vaccines, a top critic of pandemic-era lockdowns and a leader of a group that has been widely considered to be a source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics has long put out its own immunization recommendations. In recent decades it has matched what the government recommended. But asked if they might soon diverge, depending on potential changes in the government\u2019s vaccination recommendations, Kressly said; \u201cNothing\u2019s off the table.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will do whatever is necessary to make sure that every child in every community gets the vaccines that they deserve to stay healthy and safe,\u201d she said."

      "\u201cThis will honestly piss off my fans, but absolutely,\u201d Carpenter said when asked about the possibility of requiring concert-goers to drop their phones into pouches during her shows.",
      "The \u201cEspresso\u201d singer said that her opinion on having phones at concerts changed after she attended a Silk Sonic concert in Los Vegas at which she had to lock up her own phone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never had a better experience at a concert,\u201d Carpenter said.",
      "\u201cI genuinely felt like I was back in the Seventies \u2014 wasn\u2019t alive. Genuinely felt like I was there. Everyone\u2019s singing, dancing, looking at each other, and laughing. It really, really just felt so beautiful.\u201d",
      "Appearing on the latest cover of the magazine, Carpenter weighed in on a variety of topics including why she released a new album so soon after \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d her new single \u201cManchild,\u201d which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as the intense scrutiny she and many other women face.",

      "That scrutiny is also part of what might be motivating the \u201cManchild\u201d singer to support banning phones at her concert, telling the magazine that even though she\u2019s grown up in an age of fans having iPhones at shows, there\u2019s also a downside.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t blame people for wanting to have memories. But depending on how long I want to be touring, and what age I am, girl, take those phones away. You cannot zoom in on my face.

    "story": [
      "A new crime drama from Netflix is making waves not just for its gripping plot, but for the emotional truths rooted in a deeply personal past.",
      "\"The Waterfront,\" created by Kevin Williamson, is a Southern noir tale of loyalty, betrayal, and legacy centering on the Buckley family. While running a struggling fishery business in the fictional Havenport, North Carolina, they turn to drug trafficking to make ends meet, before the criminal enterprise spirals out of control.",
      "Williamson says the story was inspired by his own family history.",
      "\u201cI lived through it,\u201d Williamson tells TODAY.com, referring to his dad, \"who did a little drug trafficking on his fish boat in the '80s.\"",
      "Williamson\u2019s dad, a fisherman, was charged with conspiracy to traffic marijuana in excess of 20,000 pounds, per Netflix's Tudum.",
      "\u201cI lived through him getting caught. I lived through the trial. I lived through him going to prison,\" Williamson added to TODAY.com.",
      "The show was filmed around Wilmington and Southport, North Carolina, and Williamson grew up less than three hours away.",
      "\u201cI love filming here. The coast gives us these beautiful vistas, and the community has a strong film culture,\u201d he says. \u201cIt felt like coming home.\u201d",

      "\u201cThey\u2019re absolutely fabulous. They\u2019re fun, they\u2019re insane and shrewd and smart and lovely and gorgeous,\u201d Williamson, who\u2019s also known for \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d and \u201cThe Vampire Diaries,\u201d says. \u201cI just love my family. I love all the drama I went through as a kid. I love it because it just is \u2026 it\u2019s such a source book to pull from when I\u2019m writing.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to tell the story of a Southern family living on the coast. People that love each other, but do crazy things,\u201d he adds.",
      "The core Buckley family consists of patriarch Harlan and his wife, Belle, along with their two children, son Cane, trying to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps as he leads the fishery, and daughter Bree, a recovering addict.",
      "Harlan Buckley, portrayed by Holt McCallany, is a man struggling to hold his family and their burgeoning criminal empire together.",
      "\u201cHarlan is an old-fashioned guy in many ways. His father was that kind of a guy, that was a leader that people admired and looked up to,\" McCallany says. \"They say that you can either lead by being loved or by being feared. And I think that Harlan would like to lead by being loved.\"",
      "\"He loves his family, but if he has to get dangerous, he'll do it,\" he adds.",
      "Melissa Benoist plays Bree and describes her character as someone fighting for redemption and a place at the table. Her driving motivator is that \"she desperately wants to be seen and to be loved and to be accepted by them.\"",
      "\u201cSobriety is keeping her grounded when we meet her,\u201d Benoist says. \u201cHer AA meetings that she's going to every single day, I think that is her lifeline.\"",
      "Cane is brought to life by Jake Weary, a protective but impulsive character torn between loyalty and ambition.",
      "\"I think he wants prosperity,\" Weary says. \"Much like Harlan, I think his love for his family is unwavering, and I think he really, ultimately, wants the best for everyone.\"",
      "While the eight-episode show includes plenty of plot twists, violent turns and criminal activity, the complicated family dynamics are at the heart of it.",
      "\"I do think they have trouble trusting each other, but they love each other,\" Williamson says. \"... I wanted to tell a story about a bunch of messy people, and this is a messy family, and I think that's how every family is.\""

      "As her memory returns, so does the unbearable reality: Her three closest friends \u2014 Mirren, Johnny and Gat \u2014 died in a fire that they started together.",
      "\u201cIt was a complete shock,\u201d actor Shubham Maheshwari, who plays Gat, told TODAY.com. \u201cIn all the directions the story could have gone, it just completely made me a fool.\u201d",
      "Though the series is adapted from E. Lockhart\u2019s bestselling young-adult book published in 2014, Maheshwari and his co-star Emily Alyn Lind, who plays Cadence, read the novel while auditioning.",
      "\u201cWhile I was reading the book, I didn\u2019t see it coming at all,\u201d Maheshwari said. \u201cI think, or at least I hope, that the show kind of does that, too.\u201d",

      "In the penultimate episode, the timeline from two summers ago shows Cadence and the Liars around a fire, sifting through her grandfather\u2019s will and the ways he\u2019ll be distributing his wealth when he\u2019s gone. Cadence then ponders a world where the \u201cpetty, material\u201d things tearing the Sinclair family apart were just \u2026 gone.

      "\u201cThere was a fire,\u201d she tells Mirren and Johnny. \u201cWe burned this place to the ground.\u201d",
      "The finale shows viewers what happened: Cadence, in a drunken stupor with the rest of the Liars, suggests they gas up every part of the house with fuel from the boathouse, light a match and get out of there. So they do just that \u2014 but the fire moves quicker than the Liars. Mirren and Johnny are trapped, Gat goes in to save them, and only Cadence escapes. Just when she realizes none of them made it out, the house\u2019s gas line explodes, sending Cadence cascading into the ocean.",
      "And all that time in the present day when Cadence was conversing with Gat and her cousins \u2014 it was in her head. She\u2019s no longer simply a privileged teenager on a summer getaway; she\u2019s a girl haunted by guilt.",
      "Series creators Julie Plec and Carina Adly MacKenzie said they leaned into both the mystery and emotional fallout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated story,\u201d Plec told TODAY.com. \u201cCadence has this jarring event, this terrible thing that happened to her. \u2026 It makes her unable to understand her truth.\u201d",
      "And, despite their privilege, the Liars\u2019 choices are messy and real.",
      "\u201cYou start with characters that the audience is going to want to reject and hate just for existing,\u201d MacKenzie said. \u201cAnd then you have to give the audience a reason to stick around and to pull back the layers on their pain and their trauma.\u201d",
      "At the series\u2019 end, Cadence chooses to leave her family behind.",
      "\u201cLoyalty means doing one last thing to mourn \u2014 and also pay respect to her friends that are gone,\u201d Lind told TODAY.com. \u201cIt\u2019s the least that (Cadence) can do after everything that they have had to endure.\u201d",

      "But something went terribly wrong \u2014 and Cadence was partially responsible. As the other Liars poured gasoline all over the house, Cadence threw a lit match on the floor while they were still inside. The entire ground floor of the home caught fire before the other three Liars and the two family dogs could escape, making Cadence the lone survivor of the accident.",
      "Finally, Cadence remembers in her own time what occurred two summers ago. Back then, her doctors advised her parents to let her remember the incident on her own, because when anyone reminded her of it, she would spiral into emotional turmoil, which no doubt contributed to her migraines.",
      "As for her interactions with the Liars all summer? Cadence had been seeing them as ghosts because her subconscious wasn\u2019t yet ready to let them go.",
      "In the end, at one of the homes on the island, affectionately named Cuddletown, Cadence says her final goodbye to the Liars, whose spirits she finally lays to rest."

    "story": [
      "After decades in the entertainment industry, Sarah Jessica Parker knows how to brush off haters and online trolls, but she didn't always have an easy time navigating criticism, especially about her physical appearance.",
      "During the June 18 episode of the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, the actor opened up about \"cruel\" comments she faced in the early days of her career while starring on \"Sex and the City.\"",
      "Parker began by acknowledging that she \"wasn't prepared\" for the level of scrutiny she would receive while starring on the hit series, which premiered in 1998, and called it \"a real test of my coping mechanisms.\"",
      "\"There was no chatter about me (before this time). There was just my work,\" she said.",
      "Host Alex Cooper then asked Parker which comments bothered her the most.",
      "\"I think just discussions of my physical person,\" Parker said, gesturing at herself. \"Like stuff that I couldn\u2019t change, and wouldn\u2019t change, and had never considered changing, or even still after hearing something that was like, 'What? Somebody would say that?' (I) even still (had) no interest in changing it.\"",
      "The 60-year-old went on to say it particularly bothered her that these comments were either made behind her back or in news publications.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it was actually a conversation. I didn\u2019t feel like I could sit in a room, and someone would say to me, \u2018You\u2019re really unattractive.\u2019 And then I could say, 'Wow, um, well first of all, that\u2019s hard to hear. But second of all, why do you seem angry about it?' Or, 'Why do you feel it\u2019s necessary to say it?'\" she said.",
      "As for being able to let something go, especially when considering unrealistic beauty standards, Parker said, \"I think, maybe, there's a threshold where, maybe, crying about it because it just seemed so cruel was like done.\"",
      "She then inserted one of Carrie Bradshaw's famous catchphrases and \"couldn't help but wonder\" if these critics would say these mean remarks to her face.",
      "Earlier in her conversation with Cooper, Parker recalled the one time she cried about \"really mean\" comments a magazine made about her appearance.",
      "\"It was like a kick in the rubber parts. I was just like, 'Why is this a problem? Why is this deserving of your time? And why do you seem to delight in saying it?'\" she said.",
      "\"I was sobbing because it felt so purposeful,\" she added. \"And I think that's the only time I really cried about it.\"",
      "Parker described the moment as an \"accumulation\" of comments she'd recently read and at another point in the conversation said she considered herself a \"fairly confident person\" at the time.",
      "\"I think (confidence) really comes into question and is tested when you\u2019re kind of filleted in a way, when you\u2019re opened up,\" she said. \"And I know you know this, we\u2019re better for those kinds of experiences. But not all of us are good at it right away.\"",

      "\ud83d\udea8Warning: This article contains major spoilers for Season 2, Episode 1, of \"The Buccaneers.\"",
      "Leighton Meester laced up her corset to join Season 2 of \"The Buccaneers,\" bringing to life a character shrouded in mystery after one of Season 1's major cliffhangers.",
      "In 2023, Apple TV+ released the first season of the romantic historical fiction drama, based on the Edith Wharton novel of the same name. The series follows Nan St. George (Kristine Froseth) and her gregarious group of friends as they leave behind the new money of New York City and venture into the stiff London society across the pond.",
      "Season 1 ended with Nan marrying Theo, the Duke of Tintagel (Guy Remmers), even after it was revealed that she is illegitimate and born from one of her father's affairs.",
      "In the finale's last scene, Colonel St. George, Nan's father, told his wife and the woman who raised Nan, Patti (Christina Hendricks), that Nan's birth mother was at the wedding.",
      "The Season 2 premiere, which hit the streaming platform June 18, picked up right where things left off, with Hendricks' character storming through the crowd before she encounters Nan's birth mother: a woman named Nell, played by Meester.",
      "\"Nice hat,\" Nell tells Patti as they are reunited for the first time in more than a decade.",
      "Over the course of the Season 2 premiere, viewers learn that not only is Nell Nan's birth mother, she's also Patti's younger sister.",
      "It is revealed that after Patti had older daughter Jinny (Imogen Waterhouse), Nell moved in with the St. Georges. While living with the family, Nell had an affair with Colonel St. George, resulting in a pregnancy. After Nan's birth, Nell absconded, and she didn't lay eyes on her daughter again until her wedding day.",
      "When Nan interrupts the two sisters, Patti simply introduces her sibling as \"Aunt Nell,\" keeping her identity as Nan's mother a secret.",
      "Meester tells TODAY.com in an interview that one of the questions she had to grapple with was why her character would choose to attend the wedding.",
      "\"(Nell) probably, in my mind, stayed away as much as possible, but always had her ear pricked to what was going on in Nan\u2019s life, even before she was going to marry a duke,\" she says.",
      "So why now?",
      "\"I think that once it came out that Nan was illegitimate \u2014 the word that they were using \u2014\u00a0a little valve was released of the shame and the pain of all those years, of holding it in and thinking that it was the absolute worst thing, this mark on her, her family and Nan. And that it could potentially threaten Nan's future,\" Meester explains.",
      "But as the events of Season 1 showed, Nan's secret being exposed didn't have the impact she feared.",
      "Nan's heritage was revealed behind her back, but she later publicly owned it. Theo also stood up for her, strengthening their relationship in the lead up to their eventual marriage.",
      "\"(Nan) was able to freely open up about this information. I think that it freed Nell to some extent to go,\" Meester says.",
      "In the premiere, Nell's arrival certainly makes for a dramatic entrance, the \"Gossip Girl\" actor adds. But for Meester, her character's goal was simple.",
      "\"She knew where (Nan) was going to be at one moment, one place in time. I think she maybe didn't think, 'I will go tell Nan.' But (she went) at least to have some kind of contact, because to be away for so long from your own family is devastating,\" Meester says.",
      "As for what her character has been up to for the past 19 years, Meester says she was \"focused on forging ahead.\"",
      "\"I also think that she did, in my mind, spend many years punishing herself. And, I would put this in quotes, but 'behaving badly,'\" Meester adds. \"Because I think that's what she thought she deserved and what was expected of her.\"",
      "\"So she wasn't living a, quote, unquote good life,\" she continues. \"I think she was probably treating herself and others poorly during those years because she felt she was not good enough.\"",
      "Episode 1 ends with Nell offering Nan advice as her daughter suffers immediate regret for marrying Theo due to her lingering feelings for Guy (Matthew Broome). Then after a heart-to-heart with Patti, where Nell reminds her older sister that she was younger than Nan is now when she got pregnant, the sisters return to New York together.",
      "To Meester, Nell represents someone who survived the pain of not only giving up her child, but also the turmoil of living with that choice and keeping it a secret.",
      "\"I think you get the chance now to say that was the correct choice and the braver choice,\" Meester says. \"And that still remains today, when people have to make a decision like that. It is almost always the more sound choice if they've thought it out, which usually people have.\"",
      "Meester meticulously crafting her character's backstory is one of the many reasons co-stars Kristine Froseth and Christina Hendricks praised her addition to the cast.",
      "\"We love her,\" Hendricks tells TODAY.com. \"I was really, really excited about the casting when I found out about it. I had never met her before, but I was a fan, and so (I) didn't know what to expect.\"",
      "Hendricks notes that Meester was also tasked with joining a large ensemble cast that had already developed chemistry.",
      "\"It's always strange to come in as a newcomer when a show is already established and on its way, but she just fit right in,\" she says.",
      "\"(Meester) came in with lots of great ideas and great questions and just seamlessly fit in immediately,\" she adds.",
      "Froseth reveals it was \"nerve-wracking\" after Meester's casting was announced and she learned she would portray her birth mother. The 29-year-old actor is a huge \"Gossip Girl\" fan, but Froseth's nerves quickly settled once she met Meester.",
      "\"She's so down to earth, and so down to talk about character, and immediately wanted to do that,\" Froseth recalls. \"We didn't have much time beforehand to prep, but right away we started texting.\"",
      "She says they created a group chat so they could all be on the same page by the time filming began. For Froseth, the communication established a \"support system\" she could lean on.",
      "\"I'm really glad we had each other, because those dynamics are so nuanced and things move so fast in the show. I think it was important for me, at least, to get to talk to you guys about how you were feeling,\" she says, while gesturing to Hendricks.",
      "The \"Mad Men\" alum agrees, adding that with only eight episodes, there isn't as much time to explain the history between their characters. So, the three of them worked together to ensure audiences could sense the strained and complicated relationship.",
      "\"'What would have happened the last time they (saw) each other? What has transpired in that amount of time? Who lived where?' were some of the questions they discussed,\" Hendricks shares. \"Just technical things that the audience may not see right away, but will definitely enrich the performance and (were) important for us to have the relationships we wanted.\""

      "From the moment they met in the villa on \u201cLove Island USA,\u201d Jeremiah Brown and Huda Mustafa were inseparable. Jeremiah, a 25-year-old model from Seattle, and Huda, a 24-year-old personal trainer from Raleigh, North Carolina, formed an instant connection that would dominate the early weeks of the reality dating show, airing through the summer on Peacock.",
      "Now, as Season 7 continues its third week, Huda and Jeremiah\u2019s relationship is becoming the talk of the internet. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on and what went down in the latest two episodes.",

      "\u2018Love Island USA\u2019 Season 7 Cast: Who's Still In the Villa?",
      "Who are Jeremiah and Huda?",
      "Jeremiah and Huda become a couple in Episode 1, when the initial group of women get to choose their partners after a game that involves a bit of kissing. Their connection is immediate. When former Islander Yulissa tries to kiss Jeremiah during the game, he deflects and opts for a kiss on the cheek instead \u2014 signaling quite early he has eyes for just Huda. By Episode 3, they are laughing about being the \u201cmom and dad\u201d of the villa.",
      "Huda actually is a mother, to a 4-year-old daughter. She chooses not to share this with the Islanders until she establishes trust with them. When she confides in Jeremiah at the end of Episode 3, he is shocked but says it doesn\u2019t change his feelings for her and promises not to tell.",
      "As re-couplings and new bombshells have come and gone, Huda and Jeremiah have stuck together, even through disagreements and doubts by other Islanders.",
      "That is, until Episode 12 ...",
      "What Happened in 'Love Island USA' Episode 12?",
      "Cracks begin to show in Huda and Jeremiah\u2019s relationship during the June 15 episode. During a group challenge hosted by \u201cSummer House\u201d star Paige DeSorbo, Jeremiah kisses fellow Islander Olandria, which clearly bothers Huda.",
      "\u201cI was not expecting Jeremiah and Olandria to, like, actually kiss,\u201d Huda says in her confessional. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to see that going on.\u201d",
      "When she confronts Jeremiah about it, he doubles down on his actions and responds coolly, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s a challenge.\u201d",
      "The situation escalates when other Islanders begin side-eyeing Huda\u2019s reaction to the kiss. Nic asks Jeremiah if Huda\u2019s protective behavior is \u201cover the top,\u201d wondering if that level of reaction would be an issue for him in a \u201creal relationship.\u201d",
      "Jeremiah shrugs off the comments, responding simply, \u201cI mean I can\u2019t control what she do.\u201d",
      "But the real shock comes when host Ariana Madix sweeps through the villa to lead a re-coupling. In a \u201cLove Island USA\u201d first, America had voted on pairings for the new bombshells \u2014 Pepe, Iris and Jalen \u2014 and those left single would be at risk. In the most surprising twist, viewers choose to pair Jeremiah with Iris, effectively separating him from Huda.",
      "The re-coupling leaves Huda single and vulnerable. When the remaining coupled Islanders have to vote someone out of the villa, Huda receives two votes \u2014 from Nic and Ace, two of Jeremiah\u2019s close pals \u2014 but was ultimately saved when another Islander, Charlie, is eliminated instead.",
      "What Happened in Episode 13?",
      "The fallout from Episode 12 \u2014 from America choosing to separate Huda and Jeremiah, from Nic and Ace voting to eliminate Huda, and from Jeremiah\u2019s massive shrug at all of it \u2014 was immediate and explosive in Episode 13. Jeremiah doesn\u2019t speak to Huda for the rest of the evening after the re-coupling, later saying he was \u201cchecked out.\u201d",
      "Nic and Ace get in front of Jeremiah, though. Their conversation escalates quickly, with Nic suggesting Huda had been marking Jeremiah with hickeys so other women wouldn\u2019t engage.",
      "\u201cBoth of you are just closed off, it\u2019s been tunnel vision since day one,\u201d Nic says.",
      "Jeremiah defends their connection, saying, \u201cWe instantly liked each other and then we explored that further.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re lying,\u201d Ace replies. \u201cYou act like you\u2019re all about one person from day one. That\u2019s scamming. ... How are you so sure about someone 30 seconds in?\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Huda is spinning about the viewers\u2019 choice to separate her and Jeremiah. Does America not like her, or is America seeing something about Jeremiah that she isn\u2019t? She appears to believe the latter: She rages to the girls that Jeremiah didn\u2019t check on her after the re-coupling and rages some more about it from the shower, which Jeremiah overhears.",
      "If those seeds of doubt weren\u2019t planted by the guys before, that shower moment might\u2019ve done it for Jeremiah. When Jeremiah and Iris are sent on a date, along with the other re-coupled Islanders, he says he is open to new connections.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m excited to hit the reset button with you,\u201d he tells her. \u201cAmerica put us together for one reason or another.\u201d",
      "When the couples return from their dates, Huda refuses to greet the returning Islanders, instead sitting alone by the pool being \u201cunbothered,\u201d as she puts it. Jeremiah clocks it, muttering, \u201cOh, wow.\u201d",
      "The breaking point comes when Huda overhears Jeremiah debriefing the rest of the boys on his date with Iris. \u201cHuda\u2019s cooked, I\u2019m not gonna lie,\u201d Jeremiah says. He reveals that he\u2019d heard Huda in the shower the night before calling him a \u201cb----\u201d and \u201cliar.\u201d",
      "\u201cTruthfully now in hindsight, I would have rather Huda have gone home, just because of the way she reacted,\u201d Jeremiah tells the guys.",
      "Huda emerges from behind a wall where she\u2019d been eavesdropping and confronts Jeremiah directly: \u201cBy all means, explore,\u201d she says, flipping him off.",
      "The episode ends with a private conversation, where Jeremiah apologizes to Huda for not being there when she was almost eliminated, but Huda isn\u2019t having it.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re the reason why everything happened. You\u2019re the reason why I reacted the way I reacted,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI don\u2019t want s--- to do with you.\u201d",
      "What Happened in Episode 14?",
      "The June 17 episode picks up where Episode 13 ends, during that conversation with Huda and Jeremiah. Huda tells him that the Islanders and the viewers believe he has done \u201csubtle things\u201d that have shown his true colors, but Jeremiah replies that she has it flipped.",
      "\u201cWe have such different vibes and expectations, it seems,\u201d Jeremiah says in a confessional.",
      "Nevertheless, Jeremiah tries to make amends with Huda the next morning. During a private chat, he tells her that he\u2019d like to start over as friends. Huda\u2019s not interested in that, though. She storms away, yelling, \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me!\u201d",
      "The rest of the Islanders are watching all of this from various parts of the villa, and, as Nic says, they\u2019re drained.",
      "Fast forward to the end of the episode, when Ariana Madix shows up once again for a surprise re-coupling. This time, it involves a game where each of the women stand behind a locked door. Only the guy they want to couple with can open that door, though. Any guy who\u2019s met with a locked door and any girl who remains behind a door is left single and vulnerable.",
      "Jeremiah is the last guy to choose a door \u2014 and it\u2019s between Iris\u2019s and Huda\u2019s. He chooses Iris.",
      "That move now leaves Huda vulnerable once again, along with one other Islander, Jalen. And because \u201cLove Island\u201d never stops there, the rest of the Islanders are then tasked with voting one of the two singles out of the villa.",
      "While Huda ends up safe, receiving eight backers versus Jalen\u2019s four, the vote gave viewers a clear view of the Islanders\u2019 thoughts on this saga. Jeremiah is among the four who vote to keep Jalen and dump Huda. And another shocker? Ace backs Huda instead of Jalen \u2014 but maybe not for reasons Huda thought. When Huda reaches her hand out to thank Ace, he leans away. \u201cHell, no,\u201d he whispers.",
      "So the saga continues."

      "Barbara Walters was best known for her career as a pioneering journalist who spent many years with TODAY and ABC News. But much less well known is the tumultuous story of her private life, particularly with her lone child, Jacqueline, whom she adopted in 1968.",
      "In the new ABC News Studios documentary \u201cBarbara Walters Tell Me Everything,\u201d which features archival footage of Walters, who died in 2022, she calls her daughter \u201ca blessing\u201d that came about after three miscarriages. She adds that having a daughter was \u201cthe best thing\u201d she ever did.",
      "But others took a different cue from the challenges Walters and Jackie faced over the years, especially when paired with a demanding, international career.",
      "\u201cShe had a charged, complex relationship with her daughter,\u201d says Oprah Winfrey in the doc, adding that witnessing how parenthood played out for Walters partially influenced her decision not to have children at all.",
      "In recent years, Jacqueline Guber, now in her late 50s, has kept her private life private, but there\u2019s much to know about her younger years and her relationship with her mother.",
      "Jacqueline was named for Barbara\u2019s sister",
      "Walters adopted Jacqueline with her second husband, theater producer Lee Guber. When Jacqueline was born, the couple kept her adoption a secret, making no press announcement, NBC News reported in 2002.",
      "\u201cIn part because I really didn\u2019t want the biological mother to know that Jackie had been adopted by us,\u201d Walters said. \u201cI just kept right on working.\u201d",
      "The adoption specifics were a bit unique, though. Walters told Winfrey in a 2014 interview, \u201cWe had dinner one night with a couple we rarely saw. The woman said that she had a little girl who was blonde and blue-eyed, and they wanted to adopt a boy. ... They didn\u2019t want the girl. And we said, \u2018We\u2019ll take the girl!\u2019\u201d",

      "In the documentary, Walters reflects on some of the challenges her sister faced.",
      "\u201cToday, they would talk about it as a disability,\u201d she says, \u201cand it may even be that my sister was autistic and we didn't know it.\u201d",
      "Walters also elaborated on the name significance in her 2014 retirement special, \u201cBarbara Walters: Her Story,\u201d according to People.",
      "\u201cI knew that my sister was never going to be married and have a child, and I wanted her to have part of the joy that I had.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline helped her mother accept \u2018Baba Wawa\u2019",
      "At the height of her fame, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d cast member Gilda Radner did an impression of Walters on the show known as \u201cBaba Wawa,\u201d honing in on how the journalist pronounced her \u201cr\u201d letters.",

      "\u201cI hated the Gilda Radner \u2018Baba Wawa\u2019 until I walked into my daughter\u2019s room one night,\u201d Walters said during a 2009 interview with the Television Academy Foundation. \u201cShe was up watching it ... I said, \u2018What are you doing up?\u2019 and she said, \u2018I\u2019m watching Baba Wawa.\u2019\u201d",
      "When Walters explained she didn\u2019t like the impression, Jacqueline said, \u201cLighten up.\u201d And in the interview, Walters said, \u201cI did.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline was a runaway as a teenager",
      "After her divorce in the 1970s, it was virtually impossible for Walters as an ambitious single woman to also be a full-time mother. As former TODAY co-anchor Katie Couric says in the new documentary, being a working mother was seen as \u201can oxymoron\u201d back then.",
      "Jacqueline was not left alone, journalist Cynthia McFadden, who was adopted herself, notes in the film.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to say Jackie had a father, and Jackie had a governess,\u201d McFadden says.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how tough it was because she had a mother who was a celebrity,\u201d says Walters of her daughter in the doc.",
      "Walters explains Jacqueline struggled with schools and began taking pills. At 16, she ran away.",

      "\u201cEven though she, you know, probably kicked and screamed, she knew that things were getting so desperate, she had to go,\u201d Walters said in 2002. \u201cBut to send a child away is heartbreaking \u2026 I just knew that for this child, who was struggling enough to be her own person and not be Barbara Walter\u2019s daughter, to have this be headlines. I could have lived with it, OK. You know? But it would have been terrible for her.\u201d",

      "She later moved to Maine where she met a licensed wilderness guide named Mark Danforth, and the two married.",
      "In 2001, she started a wilderness camp for troubled teens, New Horizons for Young Women, which was open from 1999 to 2008. The camp closed during the recession after financial challenges, as she outlined in a letter at the time.",
      "Jacqueline remains private today",
      "These days, Jacqueline is living a life out of the headlines and spotlights. But in 2001, at Walters\u2019 request, McFadden sat down to interview Jacqueline for a special about adoption called \u201cBorn in My Heart: A Love Story.\u201d",
      "As clips in the new documentary show, when McFadden asks what is tougher on Jacqueline, being adopted or being the child of a famous parent, the answer comes easily: being the child of a famous parent.",
      "\u201cHands-down,\u201d says Jacqueline.",
      "\u201cI could be the bum down there on the street corner\u2019s child. \u2026 And here I am, today, made up, dressed up and it\u2019s interesting because it\u2019s almost like I was pasted into this world. And yet ... I am so regular,\u201d she adds.",

      "\u201cI felt like she neglected her personal life and poured so much into her work life, that I\u2019m not sure she was a truly happy person,\u201d Couric says.",

      "\u201cGrowing up in east London with parents and grandparents who were so patriotic and proud to be British, I never could have imagined I would receive such a truly humbling honor,\" Beckham said in a statement issued Friday through the Press Association news agency.",
      "The award, the highest Britain's antiquated honors system can bestow, was almost inevitable given Beckham's success as a player and his contribution to the country's culture. For years, Britons have wondered how he had not already been elevated to Sir David.",
      "He gets the \"gong,\" as it's known in British parlance, as part of the king's birthday honors list, which rewards notable people from across British society.",
      "The move also means his famous wife, Spice Girl-turned-fashion mogul Victoria, will now be known as Lady Beckham. Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and near-permanent fixtures in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "\u201cIt will take a little while for the news to sink in but I\u2019m immensely proud and it\u2019s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family,\" Beckham said.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of \u201992,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. That culminated in the club's winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d he said in his statement.",
      "Beckham was an elegant player, and his intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the Los Angeles Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While they are awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand \u2014 New Zealand has halted millions of dollars in funding to the Cook Islands over the \u201cbreadth and content\u201d of agreements the smaller Pacific nation made with China, officials from the New Zealand Foreign Minister\u2019s office said Thursday.",
      "New Zealand, which is the smaller Pacific nation\u2019s biggest funder, won\u2019t consider any new money for the Cook Islands until the relationship improves, a spokesperson for Foreign Minister Winston Peters told The Associated Press. Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown told lawmakers in Parliament on Thursday that the funding was \u201cnot halted, it\u2019s paused,\u201d and downplayed the significance of the amount frozen.",
      "Relations between other Pacific islands and their larger regional backers Australia and New Zealand have stumbled over ties with China in recent years as Beijing has vied to increase its Pacific sway. But the latest move by New Zealand\u2019s government was striking because it reflected growing friction between two countries with strong constitutional ties \u2014 Cook Islands is self-governing but shares a military and passports with New Zealand \u2014 over their diverging approaches to managing relations with Beijing.",
      "News of the 18.2 million New Zealand dollar ($11 million) funding halt Thursday only emerged when a Cook Islands news outlet saw its brief mention in a government budget document. It is likely to prove difficult for New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon, who is in China for his first official visit and due to meet President Xi Jinping this week.",
      "Beijing has defended its Cook Islands strategic partnership before, saying in February that the deals were not intended to antagonize New Zealand.",
      "In a report tabled in the Cook Islands Parliament this week, the Public Accounts Committee registered \u201cconcern\u201d about a reduction of 10 million New Zealand dollars ($6 million) in the government\u2019s purse, the first known mention of the finance freeze. The money was earmarked for \u201ccore sector support,\u201d which funds the Cook Islands\u2019 health, education and tourism sectors, with audits by Wellington on how it is spent.",
      "The money is part of NZ$200 million directed to the Cook Islands by New Zealand over the past three years as part of an almost 60-year-old free association compact. The links demand consultation by Cook Islands leaders with Wellington on agreements with other countries that might affect New Zealand.",
      "The pacts with China were the first serious test of those rules.",
      "The Cook Islands, population 15,000, has a large and lucrative exclusive economic zone, with Brown\u2019s government exploring prospects for deep sea mining activity. Cook Islanders can freely live and work in New Zealand, which prompted alarm about national security in Wellington when officials learned of the raft of agreements Brown signed in February.",
      "The agreements did not promise security cooperation between Beijing and the Cook Islands, but they did pledge more funding from China for infrastructure projects and educational scholarships. Not all of the documents Brown signed were released publicly.",
      "The spokesperson for New Zealand Foreign Minister Peters said Thursday that the agreements illustrated \u201ca gap in understanding\u201d between the governments \u201cabout what our special relationship of free association requires,\u201d which included consultation to ensure the preservation of shared interests.",
      "The \u201cbreadth and content\u201d of the deals and lack of consultation with Wellington about them prompted a review of funding to the Cook Islands, Peters\u2019 office said.",
      "\u201cNew Zealand has therefore paused these payments and will also not consider significant new funding until the Cook Islands Government takes concrete steps to repair the relationship and restore trust,\u201d the spokesperson\u2019s statement said.",
      "Brown said in February that the deals did not \u201creplace our longstanding relationships with New Zealand, Australia and others, but rather complements them, ensuring that we have a diversified portfolio of partnerships.\u201d News of the agreements prompted protests in Avarua led by opposition lawmakers.",
      "On Thursday, Brown made a pointed reference in Parliament to Luxon\u2019s China visit, highlighting the New Zealand leader\u2019s announcements of increased trade with Beijing and looser visa requirements for Chinese travelers. The Cook Islands leader said he trusted any agreements Luxon made in Beijing would \u201cpose no security threat to the people of the Cook Islands\u201d despite Avarua not knowing their content.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s latest action was an \u201centirely avoidable consequence of Cook Islands\u2019 strategic flirtations with China,\u201d said Mihai Sora, an analyst with the Australia-based think tank Lowy Institute.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit cute to sign up to a comprehensive strategic partnership with China in 2025 and pretend there is no strategic angle for Beijing, given all the mounting evidence of China\u2019s malign strategic intent in the Pacific,\u201d he said."

      "Trump called for Iran\u2019s \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d and wrote in a post on Truth Social that the U.S. has the ability to assassinate Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "\u201cHe is an easy target, but is safe there \u2014 We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now,\u201d Trump wrote shortly after declaring \u201ctotal control\u201d over Iranian airspace.",

If they enter militarily, they will face harm that they cannot recover from,\u201d the Iranian leader said, according to NBC News reporting.",
      "The rapidly escalating conflict, triggered by Israel\u2019s surprise attacks on Iranian military and nuclear facilities on June 13, has sent oil prices surging and put a region on edge. Initially encouraging of diplomatic talks with Tehran, Trump\u2019s statements have become increasingly threatening as populations across the Middle East brace for what comes next.",
      "But destroying Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 which Tehran asserts is for civilian energy purposes only \u2014 is no easy feat.",
      "Iran\u2019s most advanced and hardened nuclear facility, the Fordo plant in the country\u2019s northwest, is a fortress.",
      "Built inside a mountain some 300 feet underground and reinforced by layers of concrete, the plant \u2014 which is the most likely target of a potential American strike \u2014 is impenetrable by any bomb except the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP). The U.S. is the only country in the world that has this \u201cbunker buster\u201d weapon, as well as the only country with the aircraft capable of transporting and deploying it: the B2 Spirit stealth bomber.",
      "This is in part why Israel has been so eager for U.S. involvement in its offensive operations against Iran in addition to its defensive ones.",
      "But a strike in itself would not be a one-and-done job, military experts say.",
      "\u201cSo you have two challenges. You would have to drop two of these penetrators at the exact same site\u201d and likely need multiple bombing rounds, according to David Des Roches, a professor and senior military fellow at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cAnd then you would never be precisely sure how much of the facility you\u2019ve damaged,\u201d he added, meaning personnel may need to be deployed on the ground.",
      "\u201cThis leads me to believe that for those facilities, Israel will ultimately gain control of the air and then land forces on the ground, force their way into the facility by detonating the doors, and then go and place explosive charges, exfiltrate whatever intelligence they can get, and just detonate it from the inside,\u201d Des Roches told CNBC.",
      "Wider war for America?",
      "Iran\u2019s military capabilities have been severely degraded over the past few days by Israeli attacks, which have taken out substantial parts of its air defenses, ballistic missile batteries, command-and-control nodes and dozens of top commanders.",
      "Still, such a strike by the U.S. could trigger Iran to respond by striking at U.S. assets in the region like embassies and military bases. Trump has made clear that any attack on U.S. personnel would draw a fierce American response, which would then pull the world\u2019s most powerful military more deeply into a regional conflict.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have signaled that they are ready to attack U.S. bases in the region in the event of a U.S. attack on their domestic soil,\u201d said Gregory Brew, senior analyst on Iran and energy at risk consultancy Eurasia Group, noting that American bases in Iraq are particularly vulnerable.",
      "\u201cThere are risks in that environment that an Iranian retaliation causes U.S. casualties, kills U.S. servicemen, and potentially compels President Trump to expand the scope of U.S. action and order additional strikes on Iran and that, of course, would threaten general escalation and drag us into not just a single operation, but potentially a protracted air campaign.\u201d",
      "Despite its enormous scale, the GPU-57 bunker buster would not create wide-scale damage beyond the area of the facility, Des Roches said. But it would have a \u201cprofound psychological effect on the Iranians,\u201d he added, who have already seen significant damage and radioactive contamination risk wrought to the infrastructure of several of their nuclear sites in other parts of the country.",
      "A further critical question remains whether the Trump administration will limit itself to targeting nuclear sites, or whether it will expand operations beyond that \u2014 something Israel\u2019s government has also been urging, as it conveys its desire to see regime change for its longtime adversary.",
      "\u201cI think the conflict will end when Israel is confident that Iran has lost, for a significant period of time, the ability to make a nuclear weapon, and that its defenses are weakened enough that Israel will be able to go back and effectively disrupt any further effort by Iran to make a nuclear weapon,\u201d Des Roches argued.",
      "If Fordo remains operational, Israel\u2019s attacks would barely slow Iran\u2019s ability to build a bomb, nuclear analysts say. The decisions from the While House in the coming days will therefore prove decisive not only for the trajectory of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, but for the survivability of the Islamic Republic\u2019s regime as a whole.",
      "Ali Vaez, Iran project director at nonprofit Crisis Group, believes that \u201cIran can survive and rebuild its nuclear program,\u201d even without a diplomatic avenue for a deal with the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. entering the war will close the door on diplomacy,\u201d Vaez told CNBC. \u201cTrump might be able to destroy Fordow, but he won\u2019t be able to bomb away the knowledge that Iran has already acquired.\u201d"

      "A pair of raging wars in different parts of the world would be tough for any president to manage. An added complication in Trump\u2019s case is that he presides over a turbulent national security team that he doesn\u2019t appear to entirely trust.",

      "With his country having killed some of Iran\u2019s top military commanders and rattled its leadership, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says his government\u2019s aerial assault on Iran could trigger the collapse of the regime, opening the door to a popular uprising.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to predict, but it could be the result of our mighty action,\u201d Netanyahu told reporters. \u201cWe are changing the face of the Middle East.\u201d",
      "That scenario, according to scholars who study Iran, as well as former U.S. and Israeli officials, is unlikely. The theocratic government remains deeply unpopular, but it still has a tight grip on power, and no organized opposition is poised to seize authority, they say. And if there is change at the top, it might come not from a popular uprising but from a coup within the regime, which might produce an even more authoritarian result.",
      "Still, the Iranian government is struggling to cope with the attacks. Some experts say that even if Israel\u2019s onslaught does not topple the regime, it could inflict permanent damage, leaving it in a weakened state that could embolden opposition activists or fuel internal power struggles inside the theocratic system.",
      "After having initially targeted nuclear and missile sites at the start of its air campaign last week, Israel has expanded its target list to include oil facilities, police headquarters and the state television center \u2014 all representing crucial elements of the government\u2019s political and economic power.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re going after the apparatus of repression inside the regime,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank that has called for imposing tougher sanctions and other measures against Iran.",
      "If they weaken the security services used to crush dissent in Iran, the strikes could open up more space for opponents of the regime, Dubowitz said.",
      "\u201cI think their hope is we can undermine and distract the security forces and have Iranians take to the streets, as they\u2019ve been for many years now, and take back their country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the key pillars of the Israeli strategy.\u201d",
      "Wary of foreign interference",
      "But Israeli missiles may not be the ideal vehicle for overturning Iran\u2019s authoritarian rule, experts said.",
      "Hamidreza Azizi, a former professor at Iran\u2019s Shahid Beheshti University who is now a visiting fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, said that several days into the conflict, \u201cwe still see no sign of a popular uprising against the government.\u201d",
      "On the contrary, Azizi said, \u201cimages of devastation in civilian areas and the deaths of innocent people are making Iranians \u2014 who are inherently patriotic and emotionally connected to their nation \u2014 quite uneasy about Israel\u2019s ultimate intentions.\u201d",
      "Suzanne Maloney, who has written about Iran\u2019s politics and advised previous U.S. administrations, said the Iranian people\u2019s dissatisfaction with the regime is also coupled with deep national pride and a wariness of foreign interference.",
      "\u201cIranians are very well understood to resent their government. They\u2019re deeply critical of its failures, both in terms of how it has governed the country and how it has represented their interests on the world stage,\u201d said Maloney, a vice president at the Brookings Institution think tank. \u201cBut they also are fiercely nationalistic.\u201d",
      "Given Iran\u2019s bitter experience with foreign meddling, distrust of outside powers is pervasive, and it is a \u201cthird rail\u201d in Iranian politics since a U.S.-British coup toppled a democratically elected prime minister in 1953, she said.",
      "Since it came to power in the 1979 revolution that toppled the country\u2019s pro-Western monarch, the Islamic Republic has a long record of repression, using its security services to crush protests and imprison dissidents.",
      "The government is also struggling to contain rising discontent over the ailing economy, which has been plagued by rampant inflation and financial misery for millions of Iranians, according to regional analysts and Western diplomats. Officials in Tehran have blamed U.S. sanctions for the economic troubles.",
      "Every few years, popular anger erupts in the streets. Most recently, demonstrators vented their outrage after the killing of Mahsa Amini, who died in a hospital in 2022 after the country\u2019s morality police arrested her for not adhering to the country\u2019s dress code, which requires women to conceal their hair and the shapes of their bodies.",
      "Iranian opponents of the regime have had mixed reactions to the Israeli strikes.",
      "Reza Pahlavi, the eldest son of the deposed shah, who ruled Iran for four decades until he was forced out by mass street protests in 1979, said that the regime in Tehran was \u201cat its weakest point\u201d and that Iranians now had an opportunity to secure democratic rule. \u201cNow is our moment,\u201d he said on X.",
      "Several prominent Iranian activists and filmmakers, including Nobel laureates Shirin Ebadi and Narges Mohammadi, wrote an op-ed calling for an immediate end to the fighting and demanded that the Iranian government halt uranium enrichment work.",
      "The group also denounced attacks on civilians by both Iran and Israel and called for a transition to democracy in Iran.",
      "\u201cDeeply committed to Iran\u2019s territorial integrity and the inalienable right of its people to self-determination under genuine sovereignty, we believe that continuing uranium enrichment and the devastating war between the Islamic Republic and the Israeli regime neither serves the Iranian people nor humanity at large,\u201d it said.",
      "It added: \u201cIran and its people should not be sacrificed for uranium enrichment and the ambitions of the Islamic Republic.\u201d",
      "Imprisoned reformist Mostafa Tajzadeh \u2014 an ardent critic of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u2014 has condemned Israel\u2019s barrage, arguing it did not offer a legitimate way to oust the regime.",
      "\u201cI know that some sections of the people are happy with these attacks, because they see them as the only way to change the failed clerical government,\u201d Tajzadeh said in a letter from prison, according to Gooya, a Persian-language news website based in Belgium. \u201cBut even if the war leads to such an outcome, Iran will be left in ruins, where most likely statelessness and chaos will prevail.\u201d",
      "Tajzadeh, who was deputy interior minister more than 20 years ago and has favored a rapprochement with the West, called Israel\u2019s strikes \u201cthe aggression of a foreign army, on the orders of someone who has been accused of war crimes\u201d \u2014 referring to Netanyahu \u2014 which, \u201cin my opinion, lacks political and moral justification and has no precedent in post-constitutional Iran.\u201d",
      "So far, there have been no signs of major defections from the country\u2019s political leadership, and most Iranians are focused on trying to seek safety amid daily bombing raids from Israel, said Karim Sadjadpour, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.",
      "\u201cI think people are under aerial bombardment, and they\u2019re just thinking about staying alive and staying safe, staying secure. They\u2019re not thinking about waging political protests,\u201d he told MSNBC.",
      "Although an overwhelming majority of Iranians reject the government\u2019s rule, there is no opposition in waiting, and the regime remains heavily armed and organized, Sadjadpour said. \u201cAt the moment, they probably are calculating \u2018kill or be killed,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd they have their fingers on the trigger right now.\u201d",
      "Regime change",
      "Unlike their Israeli counterparts, President Donald Trump and his top aides have not encouraged the Iranian people to rise up or invoked the idea of ousting the regime. During his first term, Trump\u2019s deputies expressed solidarity with the Iranian people and privately argued that economic sanctions could cause the regime to unravel.",
      "But Trump and his current Cabinet are outspoken critics of previous U.S. attempts at \u201cregime change\u201d in Iraq and elsewhere, and some of Trump\u2019s supporters worry the United States could be drawn into another military intervention in the Middle East.",
      "Daniel Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank who was U.S. ambassador to Israel during the Biden administration, said Israel should stick to a more realistic goal of disabling Iran\u2019s nuclear and missile programs and steer clear of trying to shape Iran\u2019s internal politics.",
      "\u201cThere are certainly plausible scenarios where this becomes a regime-threatening event, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s imminent, and I don\u2019t think it should be the goal of the military campaign,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "An attempt to change the regime would be a \u201cmassive undertaking\u201d that would depend on factors beyond the control of any outside power, he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a recipe for overreach and for getting drawn into a lengthy and potentially fruitless kind of military engagement. The memory is very heavy of what happened to us in Iraq,\u201d Shapiro said.",
      "An elite coup?",
      "The Israeli assault has exposed widespread vulnerabilities in Iran\u2019s security and military establishment, which could fuel power struggles and possible defections, experts said.",
      "\u201cThe Tehran regime is unlikely to be toppled by a popular uprising, but it is possible that Iran witnesses an elite coup,\u201d said Lina Khatib, an associate fellow at the London think tank Chatham House.",
      "Israel\u2019s extensive infiltration of Iran\u2019s military and government, illustrated by its ability to assassinate top military commanders, shows that Israel most likely has a degree of support among elements of the Iranian regime, Khatib said.",
      "Even though those Iranians might not support Israel itself, they \u201cshare with Israel the objective of regime change,\u201d she said.",
      "Israel\u2019s bid to topple the Iranian government carries serious risks, including producing an even harder-line regime dominated by members of the country\u2019s Revolutionary Guard Corps, experts said.",
      "\u201cGiven the history of this regime, given what the Iranian people have suffered, I think it\u2019s a wrongheaded and ineffective strategy and one that it may, in fact, backfire on Israel,\u201d Maloney of Brookings said.",
      "\u201cBe careful what you wish for. An Iran that is racked by violence and chaos is not going to be a better neighbor,\u201d she added."

      "LONDON \u2014 British lawmakers voted Tuesday to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales after a lawmaker argued it was cruel to prosecute women for ending a pregnancy.",
      "The House of Commons approved an amendment to a broader crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished under an antiquated law.",
      "Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, the Labour member of Parliament who introduced one of the amendments, said the change was needed because police have investigated more than 100 women for suspected illegal abortions over the past five years, including some who suffered natural miscarriages and stillbirths.",
      "\u201cThis piece of legislation will only take women out of the criminal justice system because they are vulnerable and they need our help,\u201d she said. \u201cJust what public interest is this serving? This is not justice, it is cruelty and it has got to end.\u201d",
      "The amendment passed 379-137. The House of Commons will now need to pass the crime bill, which is expected, before it goes to the House of Lords, where it can be delayed but not blocked.",
      "Under current law, doctors can legally carry out abortions in England, Scotland and Wales up to 24 weeks, and beyond that under special circumstances, such as when the life of the mother is in danger. Abortion in Northern Ireland was decriminalized in 2019.",
      "Changes in the law implemented during the Covid-19 pandemic allow women to receive abortion pills through the mail and terminate their own pregnancies at home within the first 10 weeks.",
      "That has led to a handful of widely publicized cases in which women were prosecuted for illegally obtaining abortion pills and using them to end their own pregnancies after 24 weeks or more.",
      "Anti-abortion groups opposed the measures, arguing it would open the door to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy.",
      "\u201cUnborn babies will have any remaining protection stripped away, and women will be left at the mercy of abusers,\u201d said Alithea Williams, public policy manager for the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children, which describes itself as the U.K.\u2019s biggest pro-life campaign group.",

      "In one case, a mother of three was sentenced to more than two years in prison in 2023 for medically inducing an abortion about eight months into her pregnancy.",
      "Carla Foster, 45, was released about a month later by an appeals court that reduced her sentence. Judge Victoria Sharp said that case called for \u201ccompassion, not punishment\u201d and there was no useful purpose in jailing her.",
      "Last month, a jury acquitted Nicola Packer on a charge of unlawfully self-administering poison or a noxious thing with intent to procure a miscarriage. Packer, who took abortion medicine when she was about 26 weeks pregnant, testified that she did not know she had been pregnant more than 10 weeks.",
      "Supporters of the bill said it was a landmark reform that would keep women from going to prison for ending their pregnancy.",
      "\u201cAt a time when we\u2019re seeing rollbacks on reproductive rights, most notably in the United States, this crucial milestone in the fight for reproductive rights sends a powerful message that our lawmakers are standing up for women,\u201d said Louise McCudden of MSI Reproductive Choices.",
      "A second amendment that would have gone even further than Antoniazzi\u2019s proposal, barring the prosecution of medical professionals and others who help women abort their fetuses, did not get to a vote.",
      "A competing Conservative measure that would have required an in-person appointment for a pregnant woman to get abortion pills was defeated."

      "MADRID \u2014 Spain\u2019s government said Tuesday that the massive April power outage across Spain and Portugal that left tens of millions of people disconnected in seconds was caused by technical and planning errors that left the grid unable to handle a surge in voltage.",
      "Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen, who manages the nation\u2019s energy policy, told reporters that a voltage surge led to small grid failures, mainly in the south of Spain, which then cascaded to larger ones and brought the system down in the two Iberian Peninsula nations.",
      "She ruled out that the failure was due to a cyberattack.",
      "The outage began shortly after noon on April 28 in Spain and lasted through nightfall, disrupting businesses, transit systems, cellular networks, internet connectivity and other critical infrastructure. Spain lost 15 gigawatts of electricity \u2014 or about 60% of its supply. Portugal, whose grid is connected to Spain\u2019s, also went down. Only the countries\u2019 island territories were spared.",
      "\u201cAll of this happened in 12 seconds, with most of the power loss happening in just five seconds,\u201d Aagesen said.",
      "Several technical causes contributed to the event, including \u201cpoor planning\u201d by Spain\u2019s grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica, which didn\u2019t find a replacement for one power plant that was supposed to help balance power fluctuations, the minister said. She also said that some power plants that utilities shut off preventively when the disruptions started could have stayed online to help manage the system.",
      "Power was fully restored by the early hours of the following day.",
      "The government\u2019s report was to be released later Tuesday \u2014 49 days after the event \u2014 and included analysis from Spain\u2019s national security agencies, which concluded, according to the minister, that there were no indications of cyber-sabotage by foreign actors.",
      "The government had previously narrowed down the source of the outage to three power plants that tripped in southern Spain.",
      "In the weeks following the blackout, citizens and experts were left wondering what triggered the event in a region not known for power cuts. The outage ignited a fierce debate about whether Spain\u2019s high levels of renewable power and not enough energy generated from nuclear or gas-fired power plants had something to do with the grid failing, which the government has repeatedly denied.",
      "Spain is at the forefront of Europe\u2019s transition to renewable energy, having generated nearly 57% of its electricity in 2024 from renewable energy sources such as wind, hydropower and solar. The country is also phasing out its nuclear plants.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez pushed back against such speculation and defended the country\u2019s rapid ramping up of renewables. He asked for patience and said that his government would not \u201cdeviate a single millimeter\u201d from its energy transition plans, which include a goal of generating 81% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030."

      "The Trump Organization\u2019s newly announced smartphone will most likely be made in China, experts say, despite claims that the device will be manufactured in the U.S.",
      "Owned President Donald Trump, the company on Monday announced the T1, a gold-colored device that it said would retail for $499. The smartphone will run Google\u2019s Android operating system.",
      "The Trump Organization says the phone will be \u201cbuilt in the United States\u201d \u2014 but experts note the phone was most likely designed and would be manufactured by a Chinese firm.",
      "More from CNBC",

      "Japan exports fall at sharpest pace in 8 months as U.S. shipments plummet",
      "The Fed is likely to keep rates the same but give a forecast that moves markets",
      "\u201cThere is no way the phone was designed from scratch and there is no way it is going to be assembled in the U.S. or completely manufactured in the U.S.,\u201d Francisco Jeronimo, vice president at International Data Corp., told CNBC on Tuesday. \u201cThat is completely impossible.\u201d",
      "Jeronimo suggested that the phone would most likely be produced by a Chinese original device manufacturer, or ODM \u2014 a type of company that designs and manufactures products based on the specifications of another firm.",
      "\u201cDespite being advertised as an American-made phone, it is likely that this device will be initially produced by a Chinese ODM,\u201d Blake Przesmicki, an analyst at Counterpoint Research, said in a note Monday.",
      "Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint Research, added that \u201cthe U.S. does not have local manufacturing capabilities readily available.\u201d",
      "Smartphone manufacturing came into focus after Trump threatened tariffs on devices imported into the U.S. While those have yet to materialize, the American president has poured scrutiny on Apple\u2019s supply chain, urging the iPhone maker to manufacture its flagship handset in the U.S. The call is part of a broader desire from Trump to see more manufacturing of electronics be undertaken in the U.S.",
      "Several experts have noted that manufacturing iPhones in the U.S. would be nearly impossible and would certainly raise the price of the product substantially. On top of that, getting large-scale manufacturing off the ground in the U.S. would take several years.",
      "Phone will need foreign components",
      "Even if some manufacturing of the device were done in the U.S., smartphone supply chains are global, and handset components come from several countries.",
      "The Trump Organization\u2019s T1 is no different. While no information has been revealed on particular components, the specifications could give a hint of what to expect.",
      "The device will have a 6.8-inch AMOLED display, a kind of screen that is made primarily by South Korean firm Samsung. LG, another South Korean firm, also produces the screen, as does Chinese firm BOE.",
      "For comparison, Apple\u2019s top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max has a 6.9-inch display and starts at $1,199.",
      "At T1\u2019s $499 price point, the smartphone will most likely use a processor from Taiwanese firm MediaTek, which would be manufactured in Taiwan. If the device were to contain a Qualcomm chip instead, that would also most likely have to be made in Taiwan.",
      "The phone\u2019s advertised 50-megapixel camera will meanwhile require image sensing chips \u2014 a market that is dominated by Japanese firm Sony for smartphones. There are smaller players in China and elsewhere.",
      "The device\u2019s memory is one area that could use American technology, potentially from Micron, which manufactures its components in the U.S. But other players, like Samsung, could be potential suppliers.",
      "\u201cEven when there is local manufacturing available, the company will have to rely on components that are being imported from outside the U.S.,\u201d Counterpoint Research\u2019s Fieldhack said.",
      "The Trump Organization did not immediately respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment on the experts\u2019 analysis."

      "Iran plunged into a near-total internet blackout Tuesday as Israel continued to bombard the country.",
      "Two companies that track global internet connectivity, Kentik and Netblocks, told NBC News that Iran\u2019s internet connectivity plummeted around 5:30 p.m. local time, limiting Iranians\u2019 ability to access and share information with the outside world as the country becomes more deeply involved in conflict.",
      "The drop appears to be a result of a decision by Iran\u2019s government, rather than Israeli strikes on infrastructure. Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran\u2019s government, said it had restricted internet access in response to Israeli cyberattacks.",
      "Iran\u2019s government has historically shut down or reduced its internet connectivity with the outside world in times of civil unrest. Most recently, in 2019, it implemented a six-day full blackout as protesters took to the streets across the country and the government issued a crackdown on civilians, reportedly leading to the deaths of more than 100 people.",
      "The country\u2019s internet access has been reduced, but not fully blocked, in the aftermath of Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran last week, which Iran has said killed at least 224 people. Israel said Iran\u2019s retaliatory attacks have killed at least 24.",
      "The internet slowdowns appeared to particularly affect services like virtual private networks used to access foreign sites.",
      "Amir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human rights in Iran, told NBC News that some Western apps for communicating, including WhatsApp and Instagram, as well as the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store, had been blocked in the country.",
      "A WhatsApp spokesperson told NBC News that its parent company, Meta, has been engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Iran, which has been blocking internet providers used by the company.",
      "Iran\u2019s National Information Network, a nationwide network of government-approved sites that are not connected to the outside world, has largely remained accessible to people in Iran.",
      "Data published Tuesday by the internet services company Cloudflare found that two major Iranian mobile network providers were effectively disconnected.",
      "As internet services have been reduced in the country, some online have called for Elon Musk\u2019s satellite internet service provider, Starlink, to step in.",
      "Musk an wrote Friday on X, \u201cThe beams are on,\u201d in response to a call for Starlink access for Iranians.",
      "Iran has formally banned Starlink satellite internet terminals, and the country\u2019s Saed News Agency has warned that the use of Starlink in the country could help direct Israeli attacks.",
      "While Starlink does not formally have an option to operate within Iran\u2019s borders, it does offer users a Global Roam option, marketed for international travel. Starlink\u2019s parent company, SpaceX, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Holistic Resilience, a nonprofit group that advocates for information access in closed societies, said it estimates that 30,000 to 40,000 Starlink terminals are spread across Iran, based on network scans and conversations with people involved in selling them to people in the country.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran\u2019s National Cybersecurity Command announced that Israel had launched a broad cyberwarfare campaign against Iran\u2019s digital infrastructure to disrupt services to the public, but it did not provide specifics of what was affected.",
      "The Iranian news site Shargh Daily reported that Iran\u2019s cyber police agency, FATA, said Tuesday that the government had imposed some internet disruptions after the cyberattacks and that service would be restored soon.",
      "The statement came after a prominent pro-Israel hacker group that calls itself Predatory Sparrow claimed on X and Telegram, where it maintains a social media presence, to have conducted a destructive cyberattack against Bank Sepah, a national bank under U.S. sanctions for allegations of ties to Iran\u2019s military.",
      "Some Iranian ATMs were not functional Tuesday, a source on the ground said.",
      "The members of Predatory Sparrow are unknown, and the group did not respond to a request for comment. It was not possible to determine whether the group is affiliated with any Israeli military or intelligence agency.",
      "Bank Sepah did not respond to a request for comment."
