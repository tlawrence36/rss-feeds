      "Australian senators have voted to censure an Indigenous colleague who yelled at King Charles III during a reception in Parliament House last month",
      "CANBERRA, Australia -- Australian senators on Monday voted to censure an Indigenous colleague who yelled at King Charles III during a reception in Parliament House last month.",
      "The censure of independent Sen. Lidia Thorpe is a symbolic gesture that records her colleagues\u2019 disapproval of her conduct during the first visit to Australia by a British monarch in 13 years.",
      "The motion was carried 46 votes to 12.",
      "Government leader in the Senate Penny Wong said Thorpe\u2019s outburst sought to \u201cincite outrage and grievance.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is part of a trend that we do see internationally which, quite frankly, we do not need here in Australia,\u201d Wong told the Senate.",
      "Thorpe launched an expletive-laden rant at Charles following his speech during his visit to Canberra and Sydney.",
      "\u201cYou are not our king. You are not sovereign,\u201d Thorpe yelled at Charles as she was led by security guards from the reception.",
      "\u201cYou committed genocide against our people. Give us our land back. Give us what you stole from us: our bones, our skulls, our babies, our people,\u201d she added.",
      "Following her censure, Thorpe said she would repeat her rant if Charles returned.",
      "\u201cIf the colonizing king were to come to my country again, our country, then I\u2019ll do it again,\u201d Thorpe told reporters.",
      "\u201cAnd I will keep doing it. I will resist colonization in this country. I swear my allegiance to the real sovereigns of these lands; First Peoples are the real sovereigns. You don\u2019t have some random king rock up and say he\u2019s sovereign,\u201d she added.",
      "Sen. Mehreen Faruqi, a member of the minor Greens party, opposed the censure motion.",
      "\u201cThe bubble of white privilege that encapsulates this parliament is a systemic issue,\u201d Faruqi said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are here today, debating a Black senator being censured for telling the truth of the British crown\u2019s genocide on First Nations people and telling it the way she wants to.\"",
      "The vote took place before Thorpe arrived on a flight from Melbourne. Thorpe said she had wanted to be in Parliament for the vote but government senators refused to wait.",
      "Indigenous people account for fewer than 4% of Australia's population and are the nation's most disadvantaged ethnic group."

      "In 1970, after fighting in Vietnam, young Walt Longmire took a job working security for an oil company in Alaska",
      "In December, 1970, Walt Longmire, back in the States after fighting in Vietnam, was working security for an oil company on Alaska\u2019s North Slope. There, he found himself battling predators, both animal and human, in brutal weather conditions.",
      "Now, after his career as sheriff of fictional Absaroka County, Wyoming, comes to an end, Longmire tells the decades-old tale to a friend. The result is \u201cTooth and Claw,\u201d the second short novel (the other being \u201cFirst Frost,\u201d published last May) in which Craig Johnson adds flesh and muscle to the back story of a character featured in 21 novels and the TV series \u201cLongmire\u201d that spanned six seasons on A&E and Netflix.",
      "The action begins when Longmire accompanies U.S. Geological Survey researchers on a flight to a remote pack of frozen sea ice. Things go bad from the start when an enormous polar bear kills and eats a member of the team. Then it gets worse.",
      "A sudden blizzard forces the team to seek shelter in their small plane. Plunging temperatures cause equipment, including some of their weapons, to malfunction. Powerful winds tear the plane from its moorings and send it skittering upside down across the ice. The ice cracks, threatening to drop the plane into the sea. And the bear, whose white coat makes him all but impossible to see in the landscape of snow and ice, is still hunting them.",
      "The crew sees salvation in the form of a ship\u2019s hull in the near distance, but when they flee from the plane and scramble aboard, they discover that it is the SS Baychimo, a legendary ghost ship that has been floating around the Arctic since it was abandoned by its crew in 1931.",
      "They gather in the captain\u2019s quarters, find coal to burn in a stove to keep from freezing to death, and struggle to get the ship\u2019s ancient radio working so they can summon help. But before long, they discover they are not alone. The bear found the ship first and has made it his home.",
      "Meanwhile, the storm and the bear are not their only problems. A few greedy members of the research team have a secret agenda that puts Longmire in further peril.",
      "The action is non-stop in this suspenseful tale of man against nature, and the writing is so tight that the author packs more into 180 pages than many writers squeeze into 300.",

    "story": [
      "The Associated Press says it is looking to cut 8% of its workforce, primarily through buyouts, and employees eligible to leave their jobs would begin getting notifications",
      "The Associated Press said Monday that it would begin offering buyouts and lay off selected employees, part of a plan to reduce the news outlet's staff by about 8% and accelerate a transition to a digital-first organization.",
      "The move is part of what is expected to be a dispiriting end-of-year period in the news industry, which is beset by business woes that go back years. The end of a busy presidential-election cycle was also expected to accelerate reorganization plans.",
      "The AP said those eligible for buyouts were to learn of the offer, which would include severance pay and partial health coverage for 18 months, by the end of Monday. Those whose positions are due to be eliminated would learn about their fates over the next few weeks.",
      "Once considered the world's largest newsgathering organization, the AP no longer makes that claim and does not reveal the size of its staff. As a result, it was impossible to say on Monday how many people would be affected. The AP said less than half of the anticipated cuts would involve its news employees, with the bulk happening within the United States.",
      "The News Media Guild said that 121 of its members would be offered buyouts. The AP, without giving an estimate, said there would be fewer job cuts than that among the union members.",
      "For years, news executives have had to make cutbacks because solutions to their business problems have proven elusive, said Gabriel Kahn, who helps run the media, economics and entrepreneurship program at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. It has become even tougher in the past couple of years as the work of journalists has become much less visible on social media, due to changes in search algorithms and artificial intelligence, he said.",
      "\u201cThey've pulled the plug out of the bathtub and we're watching the water going down the drain,\u201d Kahn said.",
      "The AP, which prides itself on being an unbiased news source, offers news stories, pictures, video, audio and interactive content direct to consumers via the website apnews.com. But the bulk of its business comes from selling its journalism to other news organizations that use it.",
      "Earlier this year, two major news chains, Gannett and McClatchy, said they would stop buying news from AP, in Gannett's case ending a relationship that had lasted more than a century. The AP has diversified its revenue stream in recent years, including accepting philanthropic funding, but is still hurt by the news industry's overall woes.",
      "\u201cWe all know this is a time of transformation in the media sector,\u201d Daisy Veerasingham, AP's president and CEO, said in a note to staff members sent early Monday morning. \u201cOur customers \u2014 both who they are and what they need from us \u2014 are changing rapidly. This is why we've focused on delivering a digital-first news report. We now need to accelerate on this path.\u201d",
      "In broad strokes, that means an increased emphasis on visual journalism \u2014 photos and video and the digital content that incorporates them into storytelling.",
      "Veerasingham was not available for an interview, an AP spokeswoman said.",
      "AP remains a central part of the news industry's ecosystem, particularly when it comes to U.S. elections. During its election coverage earlier this month, the AP had unprecedented usage of its live video, election data, visuals and interactive products, Veerasingham said.",
      "The AP said it had reached a tentative deal with its union to offer the buyouts, but that is subject to ratification by its members. \u201cSadly, it is apparently what is needed,\u201d said Vin Cherwoo, president of the News Media Guild. \u201cThey've been seeking revenue for awhile and have had difficulty getting it.\u201d",
      "Cherwoo said it's unfortunate what is going on, but that \u201ceveryone can see what is going on at other news organizations across the country.\"",

    "story": [
      "The August Wilson adaptation \u201cThe Piano Lesson\" is an impassioned family drama but it is also a profound ghost story",
      "The piano on the set of \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d was not a mere prop. It could be played and the cast members often did. It was adorned with pictures of the Washington family and their ancestors. It was, John David Washington jokes, \u201cNo. 1 on the call sheet.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe tried to haunt the piano itself, to charge it with that kind of spirit,\u201d says Malcolm Washington, the film\u2019s director and John David\u2019s brother.",
      "In \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d August Wilson\u2019s 1987 play, the piano is a central symbol of heritage, the past and survival. In 1930s Pittsburgh, it sits, unplayed, in the home of Berniece Charles ( Danielle Deadwyler ), having been passed down as a family heirloom from the days of slavery. But Berenice\u2019s visiting brother, Boy Willie ( John David Washington ), wants to sell it to buy the Mississippi land upon which their ancestors once toiled as slaves.",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d which is currently playing in theaters and debuts Friday on Netflix, is an impassioned family drama but it is also a profound ghost story. For the Charles family, wrangling over the piano is a reckoning with their family\u2019s past, and the legacy of slavery. At its bone-rattling crescendo, it\u2019s an exorcism.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an exorcism and a possession,\u201d says Deadwyler. \u201cYou\u2019re releasing the thing that never worked and inviting in the thing that was always present but you might not have known.\u201d",
      "Adapting \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d a play about ancestors and heritage, was fittingly a work of family. It\u2019s the third in a sterling string of Wilson adaptations produced by Denzel Washington, following \u201cFences\u201d and \u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom.\u201d But it\u2019s the first Washington mostly left to his family to make.",
      "\u201cCostanza, August\u2019s widow, came to me I don\u2019t know how many years ago and asked me to shepherd these plays. I said, \u2018I\u2019m the man for the job,\u2019\" Washington said an interview alongside producer Todd Black. \"So I\u2019ve been more of an administrator. I read the play a couple times to think about how can we get this made, is this a movie? In this case, a week or so into shooting, I was like, \u2018There\u2019s nothing for me to do. This kid knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s done his homework. I\u2019m just hanging around.\u2019\u201d",
      "If Denzel Washington has been moved to carry on the tradition of Wilson by a sense of legacy, it\u2019s something he passes down in \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d The film marks the directorial debut of Malcolm, 33, who also co-wrote the script with Virgil Williams.",
      "John David Washington, the \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d and \u201cTenet\u201d star, made his Wilson debut in a 2022 Broadway production of \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d playing Boy Willie. That production also featured Samuel L. Jackson, who originated the role of Boy Willie in 1987 at the Yale Repertory Theatre, playing Berniece and Boy Willie's uncle, Doaker Charles, a role he carries over in the film.",
      "\u201cYou have all these great artists playing these notes \u2013 you have the OGs, the Wilsonians, playing it,\u201d says John David. \u201cThen you have the newcomers playing it. You start jamming together and you find it together.\u201d",
      "In Wilson, there's no greater musicality than the language, the blues poetry of Wilson's slang-drenched rhythms. The brash, fast-talking Boy Willie, in particular, is a verbal force \u2014 one that John David was enthralled by.",
      "\u201cIt feels freaking so good when the truth is coming out and you know the truth is coming out and you\u2019re discovering new meanings in these monologues that you go over and over in your head,\u201d says John David. \u201cWhen it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s a beautiful feeling. I live for those moments.\u201d",
      "For the actors, finding the music of \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d meant channeling generations worth of pain and perseverance in Black American life. Much of it they understood instinctually. Some of it they found together.",
      "\u201cBerniece has a massive amount of weight and put on top of that is grief and loss and longing,\u201d says Deadwyler, the \u201cTill\u201d star. \u201cThose are things that have been with me and in women I\u2019ve witnessed all my life. You think about the lives these women have lived and you carry it and you bear it.\u201d",
      "The cast and filmmakers were also mindful of a legacy of performance they were working in. When Harry Belafonte died during the shoot, Malcolm played a song of his on set. The day before \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d played at the Toronto International Film Festival, James Earl Jones, who starred in the original production of \u201cFences,\u201d died.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t grow up watching movies. And I didn\u2019t get in the business for movies. I wanted to be James Earl Jones,\u201d says Denzel. \u201cI was thinking of theater. To be honest with you, when I started, there weren\u2019t a whole lot of Black people for me to be like. We weren\u2019t the leading men.\u201d",
      "For Denzel, August Wilson became a lifeblood.",
      "\u201cThese are the best roles around,\" he says. \"Everybody wants \u2018em. I want \u2019em.\u201d",
      "In the film's dramatic third act, when the supernatural enters, Deadwyler could feel presences in the room. This is when \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d quakes open with all of the pain and tragedy it has been building toward. The walls \u2014 hung with photos of the actors' own relatives \u2014 shake. Deadwyler, Malcolm says, was gone. She was somewhere else.",
      "\u201cI do recall when the ancestors were coming into the room,\u201d Deadwyler says. \u201cMy eyes are closed a lot, but people carry energy. And I knew when they came in. The breath shifts.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "The Georgia prosecutor who tried the murder case made famous by the book \u201cMidnight In The Garden of Good and Evil\u201d has died",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Spencer Lawton Jr., a former Georgia district attorney who worked to expand the rights of crime victims and prosecuted a Savannah killing made famous by the book \u201cMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "Lawton died Wednesday at his home in Savannah, according to an obituary from Gamble Funeral Service. No cause of death was given.",
      "Lawton was a young Savannah attorney in private practice when he won election as Chatham County district attorney in 1980. He held the office for 28 years before retiring. During his tenure, Lawton created a program to help victims navigate the confusing and potentially traumatizing course of criminal court proceedings. It became a model adopted by other prosecutors across Georgia.",
      "\u201cHe was a huge proponent for victims of crimes,\" said Meg Heap, who worked as a victim advocate and an assistant prosecutor under Lawton before she was elected Chatham County's district attorney in 2012. \u201cYou stand on the side of right and you bring justice for somebody who would not otherwise get it, a victim coming in who\u2019s dirt poor and thinks nobody cares. That was Spencer.\u201d",
      "Despite his nearly three decades as the Savannah area's top state prosecutor, Lawton would become best known for a murder case that began just a few months after he took office.",
      "In May 1981, antiques dealer Jim Williams called police to his 19th century mansion in Savannah's historic district. Williams had fatally shot 21-year-old Danny Hansford, an employee and Williams' lover. Though Williams insisted he killed Hansford in self-defense, police suspected he staged the scene to make it appear that Hansford had fired a gun at him first.",
      "Lawton had Williams indicted on a murder charge and personally prosecuted the case. It went to trial four times, with the Georgia Supreme Court overturning convictions in the first two trials and the third ending with a hung jury. Williams was ultimately acquitted in 1989. He died at home seven months later.",
      "The case's twists and turns formed the central narrative of John Berendt's 1994 bestseller \u201cMidnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\u201d With Williams as its central character, the book portrayed Lawton as his \u201celoquent and venomous\u201d courtroom antagonist.",
      "When Clint Eastwood directed a 1997 movie based on the book, the district attorney was renamed Finley Largent.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t really think about the Williams case when I think of Spencer\u2019s contributions to the community,\u201d said David Lock, who served as Lawton's chief assistant prosecutor. \u201cI never read the book. But from what I\u2019ve heard, it\u2019s an unfair portrayal of Spencer Lawton.\u201d",
      "Lawton created a special program for assisting crime victims as well as courtroom witnesses soon after he first took office. He hired and trained advocates to explain to victims how the legal process works, give them updates on scheduled court hearings and sometimes to help them find counseling.",
      "Other district attorneys across Georgia began expanding and improving their own victim-witness programs based on what Lawton was doing in Savannah, said Pete Skandalakis, executive director of the Georgia Prosecuting Attorneys Council.",
      "\u201cPrior to the victim-witness assistance programs really getting started, victims came into a criminal justice system not of their own free will and were basically not kept apprised of developments in their cases,\" Skandalakis said. \u201cThe prosecutors themselves were far too busy keeping up with their daily caseload. So there wasn\u2019t someone in a DA's office that a victim could just reach out and talk to.\u201d",
      "Lawton retired as district attorney at the end of 2008. Two years later, he helped lead an effort to expand crime victims' rights under state law.",
      "The 2010 law guaranteed victims an opportunity to speak in court during sentencing hearings for offenders. It also required that victims be notified of the resolution of cases involving crimes against them, as well as anytime the perpetrators escaped or were released from prison.",
      "\u201cHe brought professionalism to any endeavor he undertook,\u201d Lock said. \u201cAnd his special contribution to district attorneys' offices and the legal profession as a whole was his championing of victims\u2019 rights.\u201d"

      "There are few sports journalists working today with a resume as broad as Chris Myers, writes AP reviewer Rob Merrill about Myers\u2019 memoir, \u201cThat Deserves a Wow.\u201d",
      "There are few sports journalists working today with a resume as broad as Chris Myers. From a decade doing everything for ESPN (SportsCenter, play by play, and succeeding Roy Firestone as host of the interview show \u201cUp Close\u201d) to decades of involvement with nearly every league under contract with Fox Sports (NFL, NASCAR, Major League Baseball), the kid from Miami has truly seen and done it all when it comes to sports television.",
      "Which is why it\u2019s a little surprising that his memoir, \u201cThat Deserves a Wow,\u201d isn\u2019t more revealing. It hits all the admittedly very high points \u2014 the first live interview with O.J. Simpson following the civil judgement against him in the Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman murders, the 1989 California earthquake that postponed the World Series for a week, and live on-the-scene reporting from the Centennial Park bombing at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 \u2014 but a lot of it is pulled from transcripts and comes across as a rather dry retelling of what fans will recall seeing on TV.",
      "For readers looking to get into the business, though, there\u2019s some good advice in these pages. Myers knew early on what he wanted to do with his life and began writing down his goals. \u201cGet on the radio. Be an anchor on TV,\u201d he scrawled in lipstick on his mirror as a kid. As he grew, he swapped the mirror for note cards and kept them close to his bed, reading them often as reminders. And as he climbed to a top rung on the TV sports ladder, he followed this adage: \u201cIf you don\u2019t jump at unexpected opportunities, you won\u2019t get more than what\u2019s expected.\u201d That\u2019s the tenet that convinced him to leave ESPN for Fox Sports, which was essentially a network start-up in 1998.",
      "That decision led to a slew of opportunities that brought Myers face-to-face with a galaxy of sports stars. He recalls some of his most memorable on-camera moments, from Tom Brady after winning Super Bowls to Mike Tyson in his heyday to the Boise State player who proposed to his cheerleader girlfriend live on Fox. Unlike many TV sportscasters, Myers never got pigeonholed into a sport, which explains how he became the voice of NASCAR as stock car racing surged in popularity.",
      "Being on TV does have its perks, and Myers\u2019 personal friendships with Bill Murray and Charles Barkley fall into that category. Some of the best chapters recount escapades with each of them, one involving a corned beef sandwich and another Barkley\u2019s prodigious gambling habit. There\u2019s also some real heart here, as most fans will probably have forgotten the personal loss Myers experienced in 2012 when his 19-year-old son Christopher died in a car accident.",
      "\u201cBack then I thought, \u2018Well, there\u2019ll be other days.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realize that that was the only day,\u201d is a line spoken by actor Burt Lancaster as Archie \u201cMoonlight\u201d Graham in the movie \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d and Myers uses it to reflect on how it felt (and still feels) to lose a son. The supportive role played by Rick Hendrick, the legendary owner of Hendrick Motorsports, during that tumultuous time in Myers\u2019 life, is a touching revelation.",
      "In the end, it\u2019s easy to forgive Myers for not dishing more or burning any bridges in his memoir. He admits he\u2019s lived his dream and perhaps the ultimate lesson readers should take from the book is that, sometimes, nice guys do finish first.",

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died. He was 92.",
      "Tanikawa, who translated the \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic strip and penned the lyrics for the theme song of the animation series \u201cAstro Boy,\u201d died Nov. 13, his son Kensaku Tanikawa said Tuesday. The cause of death, at a Tokyo hospital, was old age.",
      "Shuntaro Tanikawa stunned the literary world with his 1952 debut work \u201cTwo Billion Light Years of Solitude,\u201d a bold look at the cosmic in daily life, sensual, vivid but simple in its use of everyday language. Written before Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019 \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d it became a best-seller.",
      "Tanikawa\u2019s \u201cKotoba Asobi Uta,\u201d or \u201cWord Play Songs,\u201d is a rhythmical experiment in juxtaposing words that sound similar, such as \u201ckappa,\u201d a mythical animal and \u201crappa,\u201d a horn, that makes for a joyful singsong compilation, filled with alliterations and onomatopoeia.",
      "\u201cFor me, the Japanese language is the ground. Like a plant, I place my roots, drink in the nutrients of the Japanese language, sprouting leaves, flowers and bearing fruit,\u201d he said in a 2022 interview with The Associated Press at his Tokyo home.",
      "Tanikawa explored the poetic, not only in the repetitive music of the spoken word but also the magic hidden in little things.",
      "One of his works is titled, \u201cI wanted to talk to you in the kitchen in the middle of the night.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the past, there was something about it being a job, being commissioned. Now, I can write as I want,\u201d he said.",
      "In every work Tanikawa tackled, including the script for Kon Ichikawa\u2019s \u201cTokyo Olympiad, a documentary film of the 1964 Tokyo Games, the respectful love for the beauty of the Japanese language resonates.",
      "He also translated Mother Goose, Maurice Sendak and Leo Lionni. Tanikawa has in turn been widely translated, including English, Chinese and various European languages.",
      "Some of his works were made into picture books for children and they are often featured in Japanese school textbooks. He also incorporated Japanese words derived from foreign origins into his poems like Coca-Cola.",
      "\u201cTanikawa\u2019s poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience. In simple, spare language, he sketches profound ideas and emotional truths,\u201d according to the Poetry Foundation, a U.S. literary organization.",
      "Tanikawa was born in 1931, a son of philosopher Tetsuzo Tanikawa, and began writing poetry in his teens, circulating with the famous poets of that era, like Makoto Ooka and Shuji Terayama.",
      "He said he used to think poems descended like an inspiration from the heavens. But, as he grew older, he felt the poems welling up from the ground.",
      "In person, Tanikawa was friendly and unassuming, often reading in public with other poets. He never seemed to take himself too seriously but used to confess his one regret in life was never finishing his education, having dropped out amid stardom at a young age.",
      "His relative isolation from the bleakly serious scholarly poetry scene of postwar Japan likely helped him take his free-verse approach that went on to innovate and define Japanese contemporary poetics.",
      "Tanikawa said he wasn\u2019t afraid of death, implying he perhaps meant to write a poem about that experience, too.",
      "\u201cI am more curious about where I will go when I die. It\u2019s a different world, right? Of course, I don\u2019t want pain. I don\u2019t want to die after major surgery or anything. I just want to die, all of a sudden,\u201d he said.",
      "He is survived by his son, musician Kensaku Tanikawa and daughter Shino and several grandchildren. Funeral services were held privately with family and friends. A farewell event in his honor is being planned, Kensaku Tanikawa said.",
      "\u201cAs they did with all of you, Shuntaro\u2019s poems stunned and moved me, making me chuckle or shed a tear. Wasn\u2019t it all so fun?\u201d he said. \u201cHis poems are with you forever.\u201d",

      "LOGAN, Utah -- A Louisiana-based rap artist pleaded guilty Monday to his role in a large-scale prescription drug fraud ring that operated out of his multimillion-dollar home in Utah.",
      "Rapper NBA YoungBoy, whose real name is Kentrell Gaulden, walked into a courtroom in Logan, Utah, with his head hung low as he entered the plea for his part in the alleged scheme, KTVX-TV reported.",
      "The 25-year-old rapper was originally charged in the Logan District Court with 46 charges related to the alleged crime. On Monday, he pleaded guilty to two counts of third-degree felony identity fraud, two counts of third-degree felony forgery, and six counts of misdemeanor unlawful pharmacy conduct. Gaulden entered a \u201cno contest\u201d plea to the remaining charges.",
      "As part of a plea deal, Gaulden will not serve prison time in Utah. Instead, his four felony charges were reduced to Class A Misdemeanors and he was ordered to pay a $25,000 fine, the television station reported.",
      "District Judge Spencer Walsh agreed to suspend a prison sentence as Gaulden is expected to serve a \u201csubstantial\u201d 27 months in federal prison for related charges in a case stemming out of Weber County, Utah. Following his release, Gaulden will then be placed on five years of federal supervised probation.",
      "\u201cThis is somewhat of a unique case where there have been multiple jurisdictions involved both in the federal and the state systems,\u201d said state prosecutor Ronnie Keller. \u201cThis is just really a smaller cog in the bigger wheel of ultimately seeking justice.\u201d",
      "Gaulden had been living in Utah under house arrest having previously been allegedly involved in a 2019 Miami shooting. His relocation to Utah came as part of a deal in 2021 in which his lawyers argued that \u201cmoving to Utah would keep YoungBoy out of trouble.\"",
      "During his hearing Monday, Walsh said it was clear that Gaulden was a very talented young man.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many times where you have young men and women who have a lot of talent and potential. They can be robbed of that potential when they start to really struggle with their addictions,\u201d Walsh told Gaulden. \u201cI don\u2019t want that for you.\u201d",
      "Walsh continued saying, \u201cI\u2019m sure that in your future, once you\u2019re done with your federal prison time, you can be really successful on federal probation and have a really bright future where you can reach your full potential in every aspect of your life. Best of luck to you, Mr. Gaulden.\u201d",
      "Gaulden, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, also is known as YoungBoy Never Broke Again and has achieved four No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200 and one Top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100.

    "title": "Singer Paul Kelly: An Australian icon the country seems to be keeping for its own",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 12:58:24 -0500",
    "summary": "Singer-songwriter Paul Kelly is an icon in Australia but a cult figure in the rest of the world",
    "story": [
      "Singer-songwriter Paul Kelly is an icon in Australia but a cult figure in the rest of the world",
      "NEW YORK -- During his first visit to New York in seven years, Paul Kelly made sure to stop at Katz's deli, check out a friend's restaurant recommendation in Little Italy, and take some long walks. Then there was business to attend to, when he stepped onstage at a Bleecker Street club to sing his songs.",
      "To followers back home in Australia, where a Kelly show at the Sydney Opera House sells out, that's something like a New Jersey tourist finding Bruce Springsteen strumming his guitar in the corner of a Melbourne bar.",
      "While the world is more connected today than ever, it is still a big place, and regional differences abound in cuisine, culture and other traditions. The 69-year-old Kelly illustrates the phenomenon. He's iconic and growing in popularity in Australia, while a cult figure \u2014 at best \u2014 elsewhere.",
      "\u201cHe's like our Bruce Springsteen,\u201d said Vicki Zubovic, an expatriate who came to Kelly's mid-October show at New York's Le Poisson Rouge nightclub. \u201cHe tells our stories, about love, loss and all of life.\u201d",
      "Other Australians in the audience sing along to references from home in his music \u2014 like the MCG, or Melbourne Cricket Grounds.",
      "Kelly also paid debts, and showed his admiration for, the United States. He started the show with \u201cCareless,\u201d one of his best-known songs, with the opening line of \u201chow many cabs in New York City?\u201d He included \u201cEverything's Turning to White,\u201d his composition based on the Raymond Carver short story \u201cSo Much Water So Close to Home.\u201d The story of a new love, \u201cGonna Be Good,\u201d references Johnny Cash's \u201cI Walk the Line.\u201d \u201cThe line is narrow,\u201d Kelly sang. \u201cThe line is long.\u201d",
      "He's a plain-spoken songwriter whose best work is rich in emotional resonance. That's what struck one of America's best songwriters, Lucinda Williams, when her husband Tom Overby took her to see Kelly in a Los Angeles club several years ago. Williams had heard his name while touring in Australia, but never his music.",
      "\u201cI was completely blown away,\u201d she recalled in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cI remember turning to Tom with a look of awe mixed with admiration and saying, \u2018God, this guy is really good.\u2019\u201d",
      "So why the relative anonymity on this side of the world? Kelly's best chance may have come in the early 1990s when signed to a major label, A&M Records, after he emerged playing with rock \u2018n\u2019 roll bands like the Dots and Messengers in the 1980s, but without a quick stateside success he was dropped. \u201cPart of it might be the record industry,\u201d said Williams, who has her own horror stories. \u201cLet's just blame it on them.\u201d",
      "His restless eclecticism probably harms him. He\u2019s recorded bluegrass music, an album of Shakespearian sonnets, a blues collaboration of songs performed at funerals and a musical interpretation of poems inspired by birds. Tough sells for a music marketer, in other words.",
      "Then mix in some bad luck and simple geography. For his first time in the U.S. this fall since the pandemic, Kelly was to open a tour headlined by Shawn Colvin and Keb' Mo', but it was canceled due to the bluesman's heart surgery. Over the years, he's lost money on U.S. tours. The temptation to stay home and play in arenas is obvious.",
      "He comes over to the United States as much as he can, but how people respond is out of his hands, Kelly said over lunch the day after his New York show.",
      "\u201cThat's life,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's show business.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I started writing songs and performing music, I never thought of it as a career,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, I hate the word \u2018career.\u2019 For me, I\u2019m hoping to have a job where my work is my play. I manage to make a living out of it, so everything else is a bonus.\u201d",
      "A new album this fall shows Kelly's storytelling ability. Images of the \u201cthermos of sweet tea steaming,\u201d cockatoos calling and fishing lines in the back of the car on \u201cGoing to the River with Dad\u201d make a listener accompany Kelly on a trip with his real-life father, who died when his son was 13. In \u201cAll Those Smiling Faces,\u201d he brings photo albums to life as he sings, \u201cget on the floor and dance! You don't have forever.\u201d",
      "Kelly cites the work of songwriters like Ray Davies, Lou Reed and Chuck Berry as inspirations. \u201cYou can see their songs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re cinematic. That\u2019s why I sort of lean that way.\u201d",
      "Family is a big part of his work. On \u201cWhen I First Met Your Ma,\u201d Kelly is a man who tells his children about their parent's courtship. \u201cLove like a bird flies away,\u201d he sings. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out the only way.\u201d",
      "The narrator in \u201cTo Her Door\u201d \u2014 listed by the Australasian Performing Rights Association as one of the 30 best Australian songs of all time \u2014 tells of a man thrown out of his house for drinking as he travels back in a cab months later seeking reconciliation. You feel his nerves. Will it work? The listener never learns.",
      "\u201cI write mostly love songs, like most songwriters do,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I realized early on that most of my songs were not just about two people. When you start writing about people in a relationship, there are a lot of other people involved. There are exes, their parents, maybe children and siblings and friends.\u201d",
      "His catalogue is so vast and varied that in the late 2000s he hit upon the idea of performing 100 of his songs in alphabetical order over the course of four nights. The resulting tour produced a box set and eventually a book.",
      "Kelly's \u201cHow to Make Gravy\u201d is his tour de force. Asked in 1996 to record a song for a holiday compilation, his first choice of the Band's \u201cChristmas Must Be Tonight\u201d was already taken. So he tried writing his own.",
      "The result is a song with no chorus and set in prison \u2014 no jingle bells here \u2014 where the narrator phones his brother to pass along a recipe for the family feast. The call is about a lot more, of course, as he expresses regret, longing, fear of his surroundings, paranoia, even some humor. An early hint that he'd made a connection came when Kelly's brother called to say he had to pull to the side of the road when he first heard it. He was weeping.",
      "Now December 21 \u2014 the date of the phone call mentioned in the song's lyric \u2014 is known as \u201cGravy Day\u201d in Australia. Bella O'Grady, a 27-year-old woman who moved to New York earlier this year and attended Kelly's Le Poisson Rouge show, said \u201cGravy\u201d always evokes warm feelings of holiday celebrations.",
      "Kelly \u201chas become part of the Australian psyche, part of the Australian way of looking at the world \u2014 a bit cheeky, a bit cocky,\u201d said Glenn A. Baker, a music historian and former editor of Billboard in Australia.",
      "\u201cHis songs are so much a part of us,\" Baker said. \"We can't work out why they're not part of you. For many Australians, we don't mind that at all. It means he's all ours and we don't have to share him with the world.\u201d"

      "The 83-year-old will appear in a Sydney court on Dec. 18 on 24 charges relating to eight alleged victims from 2001 to 2019, Assistant Police Commissioner Michael Fitzgerald said.",
      "Fitzgerald said the youngest of the alleged victims was 17 when the first offense allegedly occurred.",
      "\u201cIn regards to the victims, we will allege that the accused knew some of them personally, some of them professionally. And we\u2019ll also allege that some of the victims when the alleged offense took place, was the first time that they ever met the accused,\u201d Fitzgerald told reporters.",
      "Jones\u2019 lawyer Bryan Wrench did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jones was arrested Monday morning at his Sydney waterfront apartment and made no comment to media when he left a police station late Monday.",
      "Jones hosted a popular Sydney breakfast radio from 2002 until he retired in 2020. He was regarded as one of the most powerful people in Australian media.",
      "He was also a successful coach of the Australian national rugby team, the Wallabies, for four years from early 1984. The team won 86 of their 102 matches under his leadership.",
      "Jones was also influential in conservative politics and was a speechwriter for Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Fraser was in power from 1975 until 1983. Fraser died in 2015.",
      "Police set up a strike force to investigate Jones after The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported in December last year allegations that Jones used his position of power, first as a school teacher and later as a popular broadcaster, to prey on a number of young men.",
      "The charges include 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault and nine counts of assault with an act of indecency. There were also two charges of sexual touching and two charges of common assault."

      "Independent bookstores have become a new battleground in China",
      "WASHINGTON -- Yu Miao smiles as he stands among the 10,000 books crowded on rows of bamboo shelves in his newly reopened bookstore. It\u2019s in Washington\u2019s vibrant Dupont Circle neighborhood, far from its last location in Shanghai, where the Chinese government forced him out of business six years ago.",
      "\u201cThere is no pressure from the authorities here,\u201d said Yu, the owner of JF Books, Washington\u2019s only Chinese bookseller. \u201cI want to live without fear.\u201d",
      "Independent bookstores have become a new battleground in China, swept up in the ruling Communist Party\u2019s crackdown on dissent and free expression. The Associated Press found that at least a dozen bookstores in the world\u2019s second-largest economy have been shuttered or targeted for closure in the last few months alone, squeezing the already tight space for press freedom. One bookstore owner was arrested over four months ago.",
      "The crackdown has had a chilling effect on China\u2019s publishing industry. Bookstores are common in China, but many are state-owned. Independent bookstores are governed by an intricate set of rules with strict controls now being more aggressively policed, according to bookstore owners. Printing shops and street vendors are also facing more rigorous government inspections by the National Office Against Pornography and Illegal Publication.",
      "The office did not respond to interview requests from The Associated Press. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement to AP, said it was not aware of a crackdown on bookstores.",
      "Yu isn't alone in taking his business out of the country. Chinese bookstores have popped up in Japan, France, Netherlands and elsewhere in the U.S. in recent years, as a result of both stricter controls in China and growing Chinese communities abroad.",
      "It\u2019s not just the books' contents that are making Chinese authorities wary. In many communities, bookstores are cultural centers where critical thinking is encouraged, and conversations can veer into politics and other topics not welcomed by the authorities.",
      "The bookstore owner who was arrested was Yuan Di, also called Yanyou, the founder of Jiazazhi, an artistic bookstore in Shanghai and Ningbo on China\u2019s eastern coast. He was taken away by police in June, according to Zhou Youlieguo, who closed his own bookstore in Shanghai in September. Yuan's arrest was also confirmed by two other people who declined to be named for fear of retribution. The charge against Yuan is unclear.",
      "An official in Ningbo's Bureau of Culture, Radio Television and Tourism, which oversees bookstores, declined comment, noting the case is under investigation. The Ningbo police didn\u2019t respond to an interview request.",
      "Michael Berry, director of UCLA's Center for Chinese Studies, said a sluggish Chinese economy may be driving the government to exert greater control.",
      "\u201cThe government might be feeling that this is a time to be more cautious and control this kind of discourse in terms of what people are consuming and reading to try to put a damper on any potential unrest and kind of nip it in the bud,\u201d Berry said.",
      "These bookstore owners face dual pressures, Berry added. One is the political clampdown; the other is the global movement, especially among young people, toward digital media and away from print publications.",
      "Wang Yingxing sold secondhand books in Ningbo for almost two decades before being ordered to close in August. Local officials informed Wang he lacked a publication business license even though he wasn\u2019t eligible to obtain one as a second-hand seller.",
      "Faded outlines marked the spot where a sign for Fatty Wang\u2019s Bookstore once hung. Spray-painted black letters on the bookstore\u2019s window read: \u201cTemporarily closed\u201d.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re promoting culture, I\u2019m not doing anything wrong, right? I\u2019m just selling some books and promoting culture,\u201d Wang said, tying a bundle of books together with brown wrapper and white nylon string.",
      "\u201cThen why won\u2019t you leave me alone?\u201d Wang added.",
      "Half a dozen other people heaved boxes of books into the back of a van. The books, Wang said, were being sold to cafe and bar owners who wanted to burnish little libraries for their patrons. Some would be sent to a warehouse in Anhui. The rest, he said, were to be sent to a recycling station to be pulped and destroyed.",
      "Bookstores are not the only target. Central authorities have also cracked down on other places such as printing shops, internet bars, gaming rooms and street vendors. Strict inspections have taken place all over the country, according to Chinese authorities.",
      "Authorities in Shanghai inspected printing places and bookstores, looking for \u201cprinting, copying or selling illegal publications,\u201d according to a government document. This shows the authorities are not just barring the sale of some publications, but tracing them back to the printing process. They found some printing stores did not \u201cregister the copy content as required\u201d and demanded they fix the problem quickly.",
      "In Shaoyang, a city in China\u2019s south, authorities said they will be \u201ccracking down on harmful publications in accordance with the law.\u201d",
      "The Communist Party has various powers to control which books are available. Any publication without a China Standard Book Number is considered illegal, including self-published books and those imported without special licenses. Books can be banned even after they are published if restrictions are later tightened \u2014 often for unclear reasons \u2014 or if the writers say something upsetting to the Chinese authorities.",
      "Yet despite these restrictions and the crackdown on existing booksellers, more bookstores are opening. Recent figures are unavailable, but a survey by Bookdao, a media company that focuses on the book industry, shows more than twice as many bookstores opened than closed in China in 2020.",
      "Liu Suli, who has been running All Sages Books in Beijing for over three decades, says there are many idealists in the industry.",
      "\u201cEveryone who reads has a dream of having a bookstore,\u201d Liu says, despite the challenges.",
      "In many cases, those dreams are being fulfilled outside China. Yu and other Chinese booksellers around the world stock their shelves with books from Hong Kong, Taiwan and mainland China, as well as books published locally.",
      "Zhang Jieping, founder of Nowhere, a bookstore in Taiwan and Thailand, said there's a growing demand for books from migrants who left China after the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t just want to speak fluent English or Japanese to fit in, they want cultural autonomy,\u201d Zhang said. \u201cThey want more community spaces. Not necessarily a bookstore, but in any format \u2014 a gallery, or a restaurant.\u201d",
      "Li Yijia is a 22-year-old student who arrived in Washington from Beijing in August. One Sunday morning, she wandered through JF Books where she found titles in Chinese and English. She said a Chinese bookstore feels like \u201canother world in a bubble\u201d which helps her critical thinking by allowing her to read books in both languages.",
      "\u201cIt also relieves homesickness, like a Chinese restaurant,\u201d Li added.",
      "The closure of the bookstores leads the owners to different paths. Some ended up in jail, some went looking for jobs to feed their families. Some started a journey to leave censorship behind.",
      "Since he closed his Shanghai bookstore, Zhou, 39, has moved to Los Angeles, but hasn't decided what his next step will be.",
      "He said his fully licensed independent bookstore, which sold art books and self-published works by artists and translators, was fined thousands of dollars and he was interrogated over a dozen times during the past four years. He's seen colleagues jailed for selling \u201cillegal publications.\u201d All the self-published book artists and editors he worked with asked him to take down their work after warnings by local authorities.",
      "Zhou said he could not handle further harassment. He said it was as if he were \u201csmuggling drugs instead of selling books.\u201d",
      "The existence of his bookstore, Zhou said, was \u201ca rebellion and a resistance,\u201d which is not there anymore.",

      "\u201cI feel like I have gone through every single number on the call sheet now,\u201d Yang told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve learned from a lot of other great No. 1s, you know? To carry yourself a certain way. It\u2019s not just about showing up when you work, but it\u2019s also about leading by example.\u201d",
      "The dramedy, premiering Tuesday, is told from the view of Willis, a Chinatown restaurant server stuck in a police procedural show whose perspective starts to shift as he looks into the yearslong disappearance of his older brother. The 10-episode season has a mostly Asian cast including Ronny Chieng, Chloe Bennet, Archie Kao and Tzi Ma. There is also plenty of Asian talent behind the scenes, led by Yu, who serves as creator and executive producer.",
      "The episodes are full of nods to cop dramas such as \u201cLaw & Order.\u201d They also evoke scenes from '80s and '90s U.S. action-comedies structured around one of the co-leads being Asian and knowing martial arts \u2014 think \u201cRush Hour\u201d and \u201cMartial Law.\u201d But it wasn't a youth spent watching these movies and shows that inspired Yu's book, which is structured like a screenplay.",
      "\u201cMore what informed the book was the experiences of my parents, who are immigrants, and of their community and seeing how they and their friends had built lives here, were trying to be Americans, were succeeding at it in a lot of ways, but still were feeling like outsiders \u2014 and wanting to just tell their story,\u201d Yu said.",
      "Taika Waititi, the director of \u201cJojo Rabbit\u201d and two \u201cThor\u201d movies and the first person of M\u0101ori descent to win an Academy Award, also produces. He's no stranger to promoting underrepresented voices on television, co-creating the Emmy-nominated \u201cReservation Dogs,\u201d the first series where every role on and off-screen was held by someone Indigenous. Growing up in New Zealand, he saw similarities in \u201cInterior Chinatown\u201d with how Indigenous M\u0101ori like him were treated even in daily interactions.",

There were people who got to come in \u2014 and I\u2019d been working there for six months \u2014 and they went straight to work on the till,\u201d Waititi told The Associated Press. \u201cOne of the big draws to me was to be able to be involved in something that highlights those issues.\u201d",
      "The series' episode titles reference different archetypes that have shadowed Asian American actors for decades. These include \u201cdelivery guy,\u201d \u201ctech guy,\u201d \u201ckung fu guy\u201d and \u201cChinatown expert.\u201d There has been a reclaiming in recent years of \u201ckung fu guy,\u201d particularly. Marvel\u2019s \u201cShang-Chi,\u201d the CW\u2019s \u201cKung Fu,\u201d and \u201cWarrior\u201d on Max all have protagonists with martial arts prowess who also deal with personal baggage. All three stories happen to take place in San Francisco\u2019s Chinatown.",
      "The show's commentary on stereotyping seems more relevant in a post-coronavirus pandemic era, Ma said.",
      "\u201cIn every major city, you know, the Chinatowns are going through hard times particularly after the pandemic,\u201d Ma said. \u201cI hope that people who come to Chinatown realize that Chinatown isn't just a place for you to eat food. It\u2019s a community.\u201d",
      "Chieng, who plays curmudgeonly restaurant server Fatty Choi, memorably stuck up for Chinatowns everywhere in 2016 when he used his \u201cDaily Show\u201d gig to put Fox News\u2019 Jesse Watters on blast for a racist segment about Manhattan\u2019s Chinatown. (The Malaysian-born comedian says that takedown helped get him his part in \u201cCrazy Rich Asians,\u201d alongside Yang. Unlike the characters in \u201cInterior Chinatown,\u201d he says, he has since been very fortunate. In fact, he didn\u2019t even have to read for Yu and other producers.)",
      "A third of \u201cInterior Chinatown's\u201d main cast has been in projects set in a Chinatown, which Yu says affirms the story's examination of how Hollywood limits the range of roles available to Asian Americans.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to look too far down the IMDb listings of some of our cast who are really successful actors, but a few years ago could have easily been \u2014 you know, Jimmy likes to still tell the story of how he was \u2018Chinese Teenager (#1)\u2019 on Chloe\u2019s show, \u2018Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,\u2019 which is 10 years ago,\u201d Yu said.",
      "Bennet, who is half Chinese and half white, has spoken out before about struggling to be considered for roles when she used her actual surname, Wang. For so long, Bennet felt like her whiteness was what people saw at work and her \u201c\u2018Asian-ness\u2019 was always reserved for home,\u201d the former \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d star told the AP. So, just walking onto the \u201cInterior Chinatown\u201d set was emotional.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m viewed as white and so I\u2019ve never really been a part of something where being Asian was so much at the forefront on and off-screen,\u201d Bennet said. \u201cAnd so being surrounded by our incredible crew, who was also very diverse, was something I didn\u2019t realize I\u2019d seen and that it was the immediate power of representation. I felt so much more comfortable.\u201d",
      "Yang, though, was too embarrassed to tell his frequent scene partner about his nameless part on her show.",
      "\u201cThe journey that Willis was going through was the journey that I went through. I just have to zoom back 10 years,\u201d said Yang, who also has his own production company. \u201cI had a phase where I was fighting for the same kind of roles. ... Even I had to fight to get Chinese Teenager #1.\u201d"

      "It was the last thing you might expect if you watched MSNBC's \u201cMorning Joe\u201d a month ago \u2014 hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski asking for a meeting and traveling to Mar-a-Lago to talk with President-elect Donald Trump",
      "MSNBC hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, fierce critics of President-elect Donald Trump, say they traveled to Mar-a-Lago for a meeting with him to reopen lines of communication that would better serve their morning show viewers.",
      "With feelings still raw two weeks after the election, their journey to Trump's Florida home hasn't gone over that well with many fans and critics of \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d",
      "The show's anchor team had been so critical of Trump that, in September, Scarborough said that \u201cit's not a reach\u201d to compare him to Hitler. MSNBC pulled \u201cMorning Joe\u201d from the air the Monday after the assassination attempt on Trump this past summer.",
      "On Monday's show, the hosts said they had reached out to Trump last Thursday and met with him the next day. \u201cIt was the first time we have seen him in seven years,\u201d Brzezinski said.",
      "She said Trump was \u201ccheerful, upbeat,\u201d even as the three of them discussed issues they disagreed on.",
      "\u201cWhat we did agree on was to restart communications,\u201d she said. Her father, the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser in Jimmy Carter's administration, often spoke with world leaders he disagreed with, and she said that's a job for journalists and commentators too.",
      "\u201cFor those asking why we would speak to the president-elect during such fraught times, especially between us, I guess I would ask back, \u2018Why wouldn\u2019t we?'\u201d Brzezinski said.",
      "Trump confirmed the meeting in an interview with Fox News Digital. \u201cI very much appreciated the fact that they wanted to have open communication,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many ways, it's too bad that it wasn't done long ago.\u201d",
      "Not everyone reacted the same way. On \u201cThe View\u201d Monday, co-host Sunny Hostin said the country needs a free press willing to speak truth to power and she didn't think it was necessary to travel to Mar-a-Lago to \u201ckiss the ring.\u201d A co-host, Alyssa Farah Griffin, said she thought highly of the MSNBC hosts for recognizing how many people voted for Trump.",
      "Jeff Jarvis, author of the BuzzMachine blog and a retired journalism professor at the City University of New York, said online that \u201cit is a disgusting show of obeisance in advance.\u201d",
      "Several conservative commentators weren't impressed either. Talk show host Buck Sexton, in a post on X, called the meeting astounding. \u201cTrump's victory is so complete, \u2018Morning Joe\u2019 has fully surrendered,\u201d Sexton wrote. Veteran cable news personality Greta Van Susteren called it \u201cgroveling.\u201d",
      "\u201cMorning Joe,\u201d like many shows on MSNBC, has seen its ratings drop precipitously since the election as its liberal audience takes a break. It's a post-election pattern similar to that experience in past years with viewers who supported the losing party. After a break, many usually return.",
      "Neither host was available to speak to a reporter after the show, a network spokesman said. Scarborough seemed to anticipate criticism when talking about the decision to meet with Trump.",
      "\u201cDon't be mistaken,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're not here to defend or normalize Donald Trump. We're here to report on him and hopefully provide you with insights.\u201d",
      "In the same Fox News interview, Trump said that he had an obligation to the American public to be open and available to the press. \u201cIf not treated fairly, however, that will end,\u201d he said.",

      "They said information gathered in a raid on Combs' cell at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn were cited in papers the government filed in Manhattan federal court on Friday in a bid to keep the music mogul locked up before his May 5 trial.",
      "\u201cThis is a matter of grave concern that, most respectfully, must be addressed immediately,\u201d the lawyers told Judge Arun Subramanian, who already has scheduled a bail hearing for Friday for Combs. They requested an \u201cimmediate hearing\u201d so prosecutors can explained who authorized the search of Combs' cell, where personal effects and paperwork were seized.",
      "Later Monday, prosecutors responded to the claims with a letter to the judge saying that the inspection of Combs\u2019 cell was part of a jail-wide, safety-related sweep unrelated to Combs or his prosecution.",
      "They said the search was planned before Combs was arrested and was properly carried out with an investigator who entered Combs' cell and decided to not examine a manila envelop labeled \u201clegal\u201d that was in the cell.",
      "They added that any potentially privileged materials were viewed first by a \u201cfilter team\u201d of government lawyers not working on the case. The team was tasked with weeding out any confidential communications protected by attorney-client privilege so that trial prosecutors couldn\u2019t see them.",
      "Combs, 55, has been held since his September arrest on charges that he coerced and abused women for years with the aid of a network of associates and employees. An indictment accuses him of silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",
      "Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is currently seeking to be freed to house arrest through a $50 million bail package.",
      "On Friday, prosecutors said Combs has been trying to dodge scrutiny of his jailhouse communications while orchestrating social media campaigns aimed at tainting the jury pool and trying to publicly leak materials he views are helpful to his case. They said he also has contacted witnesses through third parties.",

      "Many of Hollywood\u2019s biggest stars have gathered at the annual Governors Awards in Los Angeles to honor the late Quincy Jones, James Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The family of Quincy Jones was not sure they wanted to attend the Governors Awards.",
      "Their father died two weeks before he could accept his second honorary Oscar, alongside Bond producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, filmmaker Richard Curtis and casting director Juliet Taylor.",
      "But the Jones family decided to show up for the event Sunday night in Hollywood for a celebration of his life and work with humor from Jamie Foxx, a rousing performance by Jennifer Hudson and a moment with his family: His daughter Rashida Jones even read the speech he had been working on up until a month ago.",
      "\u201cWe felt like we wanted to celebrate his beautiful life and career,\u201d she said. \u201cHis music has literally defined an entire century of culture spanning genres.\u201d",
      "It was a moving end to a celebratory evening that had Hugh Grant roasting Curtis for getting a \u201ckind of Oscar\u201d and Daniel Craig celebrating the legacy of the James Bond films.",
      "The audience in the Ray Dolby Ballroom was starrier than even the Oscars. The event, put on by the film academy\u2019s board of governors, is also a de-facto campaign stop for Oscar hopefuls as awards season gets underway.",
      "Everywhere you looked there were famous faces greeting one another: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson at the bar ordering a margarita on the rocks; Jude Law and Kristen Wiig exchanging hellos; Zooey Deschanel sipping champagne; Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz Beckham wandering around; Saoirse Ronan and Elizabeth Olsen deep in conversation; Sharon Stone hugging Kieran Culkin; Jesse Eisenberg chatting with Elle Fanning; and Jeremy Strong taking a selfie with Guy Pearce.",
      "Others remained near their seats, like Jennifer Lawrence, June Squibb and Angelina Jolie, who attended alongside her son Knox Jolie-Pitt. They sat beside her \u201cMaria\u201d director Pablo Larra\u00edn and across from \u201cHis Three Daughters\u201d stars Natasha Lyonne and Olson. At another table, Barry Keoghan kept making his way to Margarat Qualley\u2019s side, squeezing in between her and Demi Moore.",
      "But most of the schmoozing subsided for the main event. With no television cameras or band to play anyone off during a speech, it is a night during which friends and colleagues can pay tribute to the year\u2019s honorary Oscar recipients.",
      "Broccoli and her brother Wilson followed in her father\u2019s footsteps receiving the rarely given Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, celebrating the work of producers. Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli accepted his own trophy, then a bust of Thalberg, at the 1982 Academy Awards as they looked on from the audience.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s heavier than I thought,\u201d Wilson said, holding the Oscar statuette.",
      "Broccoli also commented on the importance of producers, a credit she said that lately is being handed out like party favors.",
      "They got some gentle ribbing from Craig beforehand. Broccoli, he said, \u201ccackles, I mean, crackles with passion.\u201d But for a man who has always had a seemingly conflicted relationship with his Bond era, his admiration for them was evident.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I admire your integrity,\u201d Craig said. \u201cThese (Bond movies) are the most expensive independent films ever made.\u201d",
      "Grant was less delicate but infinitely funnier paying tribute to Curtis, who has written for and directed him in many films including \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral,\u201d \u201cNotting Hill\u201d and \u201cLove, Actually.\u201d",
      "\u201cWould we call it an Oscar? It\u2019s a kind of Oscar,\u201d Grant said. \u201cIt\u2019s a better than nothing Oscar.\u201d",
      "Curtis may be best known for his contributions to romantic comedies, but the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award was for a lifetime of charitable work, which Grant said was \u201cannoying and frankly selfish.\u201d In his acceptance speech, Curtis made a plea to the room to set aside a small portion of film budgets to hire an impact producer.",
      "Nicole Kidman presented the honorary Oscar to Taylor, a casting director unaccustomed to being publicly celebrated for her contributions to cinema. In her career of more than four decades, she cast classics like \u201cAnnie Hall,\u201d \u201cWorking Girl,\u201d \u201cSleepless in Seattle\u201d and \u201cSchindler\u2019s List.\u201d Squibb, at the event with her \u201cThelma\u201d director Josh Margolin, said that Taylor cast her in her fist film, Woody Allen\u2019s \u201cAlice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019d have a career in motion pictures without it,\u201d Squibb said.",
      "While Taylor was excited about her award, she was even happier that her peers are soon going to be regularly recognized. Starting with films released in 2025, the film academy will give a new competitive Oscar to casting directors.",
      "There were many somber references throughout the evening to the events of the \u201clast few weeks,\u201d although no one speaking from the stage said anything much more specific. Jamie Foxx, introducing the Quincy Jones tribute, did his own little impersonation of President Elect Donald Trump.",
      "\u201cWhy is everyone so down on these few weeks,\u201d he said.",
      "Foxx quickly got back on track to speak about Jones, whose celebration closed out the evening on a cathartic note.",
      "\u201cHe was really excited to attend tonight,\u201d Rashida Jones said. \u201cHe has so many friends in this room. Well, actually, probably in every room to be honest because wherever he went he made connections with everyone. Real ones. He knew how to stay present, to stay curious, to stay loving.\"",
      "Jones invited the audience to listen on the way home, to go for the deepest cuts.",
      "\u201cThere's an entire universe waiting in his seven decades of music,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd while you listen, hear him, hear how he imbued love into every single second of music he made. That was his real legacy: Love.\u201d"

      "Bidders won't be buying the same fruit that was on display in Miami. Those bananas are long gone. Sotheby\u2019s says the fruit always was meant to be replaced regularly, along with the tape.",
      "\u201cWhat you buy when you buy Cattelan\u2019s \u2018Comedian\u2019 is not the banana itself, but a certificate of authenticity that grants the owner the permission and authority to reproduce this banana and duct tape on their wall as an original artwork by Maurizio Cattelan,\u201d Galperin said.",
      "The very title of the piece suggests Cattelan himself likely didn't intend for it to be taken seriously. But Chlo\u00e9 Cooper Jones, an assistant professor at the Columbia University School of the Arts, said it is worth thinking about the context.",
      "Cattelan premiered the work at an art fair, visited by well-off art collectors, where \u201cComedian\u201d was sure to get a lot of attention on social media. That might mean the art constituted a dare, of sorts, to the collectors to invest in something absurd, she said.",
      "If \u201cComedian\u201d is just a tool for understanding the insular, capitalist, art-collecting world, Cooper Jones said, \u201cit\u2019s not that interesting of an idea.\u201d",
      "But she thinks it might go beyond poking fun at rich people.",
      "Cattelan is often thought of a \u201ctrickster artist,\u201d she said. \u201cBut his work is often at the intersection of the sort of humor and the deeply macabre. He\u2019s quite often looking at ways of provoking us, not just for the sake of provocation, but to ask us to look into some of the sort of darkest parts of history and of ourselves.\u201d",
      "And there is a dark side to the banana, a fruit with a history entangled with imperialism, labor exploitation and corporate power.",
      "\u201cIt would be hard to come up with a better, simple symbol of global trade and all of its exploitations than the banana,\u201d Cooper Jones said. If \u201cComedian\u201d is about making people think about their moral complicity in the production of objects they take for granted, then it's \u201cat least a more useful tool or it\u2019s at least an additional sort of place to go in terms of the questions that this work could be asking,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cComedian\u201d hits the block around the same time that Sotheby's is also auctioning one of the famed paintings in the \u201cWater Lilies\u201d series by the French impressionist Claude Monet, with an expected value of around $60 million.",
      "When asked to compare Cattelan's banana to a classic like Monet's \u201cNymph\u00e9as,\" Galperin says impressionism was not considered art when the movement began.",
      "\u201cNo important, profound, meaningful artwork of the past 100 years or 200 years, or our history for that matter, did not provoke some kind of discomfort when it was first unveiled,\u201d Galperin said.",

      "Turkey Trots have become an enduring Thanksgiving tradition for many experienced runners and novices alike",
      "Thanksgiving morning is often a blur of last-minute meal preparation and frenzied chores. But for Beth Thomas, who typically hosts her family at her Boston-area home, most of the work in the kitchen is already done.",
      "Instead, she laces up her sneakers and warms up for a 5K Turkey Trot run with her two sons.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a fun thing for us to do, knowing probably seven hours later, everyone\u2019s going to be passed out on the couch after having overindulged appropriately. It\u2019s a high point for us to be out there,\u201d said Thomas. \u201cWhy not start the day doing something that we really love and then eat a lot of good food later?\u201d",
      "Turkey Trots have become an enduring tradition for many people on and around Thanksgiving. There are thousands of races, ranging from about 1 mile to a full marathon.",
      "Run Signup, a platform where runners can register and fundraise for races, calls Thanksgiving \u201cthe biggest US running day of the year.\u201d More and more people are joining in, it said; 2023 saw the highest number of turkey trotters ever registered on the site, with almost 1 million runners across the country.",
      "Some do it for fitness, others for family and community, and many are also raising money for charities. The races attract both novices and serious runners.",
      "There are also Turkey Trots that go by other names: Gobble Wobbles, Drumstick Dashes and Huffing for Stuffings. While most races are held on Thanksgiving Day, some take place the weekend before or after.",
      "Thomas and her sons have run in Thanksgiving races for several years. Sometimes other relatives join them. Still others cheer them on from the sidelines.",

      "Mike Baggerman, the communications director at the YMCA Buffalo Niagara, said Buffalo\u2019s race \u2014 officially a year older than the Boston Marathon \u2014 has become a hallmark for the community.",
      "While some runners show up for the 8K race with a competitive spirit and achieve record-setting times, the overwhelming majority are \u201cpeople like you and me who just want to have something fun to do on Thanksgiving Day.\u201d",
      "Children and people who use wheelchairs are frequent participants, Baggerman said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most memorable races,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a fun run.\u201d",
      "Many beginning runners train in the weeks and months leading up to Thanksgiving to compete in a Turkey Trot. Even for those who don\u2019t run regularly, the jolt of activity \u2014 perhaps a mix of walking and running \u2014 can feel good.",
      "Prioritizing exercise and movement during a week when many have long to-do lists and multiple stressors is often difficult, said dietician and Michigan-based fitness instructor Casey Young. To her, Thanksgiving races can not only help people reach their physical activity goals but also help stabilize their mood and reduce stress.",
      "\u201cHolidays tend to be such a stressful time for a lot of people, and sometimes people are traveling, and that can add some additional stress and get you out of your typical routine,\u201d Young said. \u201cSo, anytime we have an opportunity to move our body is a positive thing.\u201d",
      "Exercise may prompt people to be \u201cmore mindful and intentional\u201d when plating up later, Young said, but she warns against the mentality that the purpose of the exertion is to earn a decadent Thanksgiving meal or to burn it off afterward. That could foster an \u201cunhealthy relationship with food.\u201d",
      "Turkey trotters should instead emphasize the physical activity and its health benefits, she said.",
      "Beyond the physical and mental benefits, many turkey trotters lean into the holiday\u2019s spirit of thankfulness and giving back.",
      "Some of the races are organized as fundraisers in partnership with local organizations. Registration fees for participants and donations on their behalf often benefit causes like food banks, homeless shelters and community programs.",
      "Baggerman said the Buffalo Niagara YMCA\u2019s turkey trot is the organization\u2019s largest fundraiser of the year, raising money for affordable childcare, community classes, health and wellness programs, and efforts to combat food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s more than just a fun 5-mile run on Thanksgiving Day. It\u2019s something that helps the YMCA achieve its mission, which is to strengthen the western New York community,\u201d he said. \u201cFor Buffalo people to step up every single year and sell this race out at 14,000, it\u2019s a miracle.\u201d"

      "There\u2019s one exercise group that says you really can keep up with outdoor workouts through the winter",
      "The sun had yet to come up in Edmonton, Alberta, and it was more than 20 degrees below zero. Tanis Smith layered up anyway, ready to run up and down hundreds of stairs among the trees in the Saskatchewan River Valley.",
      "When she arrived at 6 a.m., 10 other people joined her. It wouldn\u2019t be the last time they risked freezing their toes off to get in a workout before the rest of the world wakes up.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re pretty much just putting everything you own on,\u201d said Smith, an accountant. \u201cIf you look at the pictures, you don\u2019t know who you are unless you remember what you were wearing.\u201d",
      "Since that winter of 2013, Smith has rarely missed a workout with the group, called November Project, a network of free outdoor group exercise classes that started in Boston. No matter the month or weather, participants roll out of bed before dawn at least once a week and shield their faces from the blistering cold.",
      "One part intense training and one part abject silliness, the project is a model for how to stay motivated to exercise outside throughout the winter.",
      "It started when a pair of friends challenged each other to exercise every morning for the month of November. By the end of the month, they were recruiting others.",
      "\u201cA party is better when there\u2019s more people around,\u201d said Bojan Mandaric, who created the project with Brogan Graham in 2011. \u201cWe would talk to anybody who would listen.\u201d",
      "Soon, their meetings were attracting a few dozen people, who then brought the idea to other cities when they moved. Now there are 52 chapters in eight countries, including 44 in the United States and Canada.",
      "Workouts, which attract all ages and fitness levels, begin with a \u201cbounce,\u201d a hopping, call-and-response chant to loosen people up physically and mentally. How the classes continue varies on the location and day of the week, but most include running and body weight exercises like squats or burpees.",
      "To promote the idea that exercise can be fun, they also might weave in activities that would be at home during childhood recess in the schoolyard.",
      "In Edmonton, they\u2019ve played an intense version of duck duck goose, gone sledding in winter and done Slip \u2019n\u2019 Slide in summer. One workout in Boston involved a kind of Easter egg hunt, where you search for plastic eggs at a sprint. Crack them open to find commands that could be, walk like a gorilla, do a cartwheel, or grab grass and dump it on Mandaric\u2019s head.",
      "The point is to lower inhibitions, which helps people make connections, said Jason Shaw, co-leader of the Indianapolis chapter.",
      "\u201cNobody\u2019s cool at November Project,\u201d he said. \u201cAt different gyms, especially, you always have the people who just are so cool, or think they\u2019re so cool. We try to nip that in the bud.\u201d",
      "Shaw said chapters mark different milestones, much like Scout merit badges, by spray painting a tag on your shirt for, say, showing up on your first single-digit day.",
      "But they don\u2019t spray when it\u2019s too cold. The paint freezes.",
      "If you don\u2019t have a chapter nearby, many cities offer some kind of running or outdoor exercise group, though many are not free. Otherwise, November Project organizers offered a few suggestions on how to stay motived to keep working through the colder months.",
      "Accountability is a core tenet of the project. Members make a verbal promise to show up, and there is almost a sense of letting down your teammates if you don\u2019t, said Mandaric, who moved to Boston from Serbia to row crew for Northeastern University.",
      "There\u2019s no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing, Shaw said. At a minimum, buy a moisture-wicking base layer that will help keep you warm and dry. Avoid cotton, which keeps sweat in contact with your body and will make you colder. And add a top jacket with wind-breaking fabric.",
      "Commit to exercising on the same days and times for a month. Creating a predictable routine will help you get into a groove that is easier to maintain, Mandaric said.",
      "One of the things Smith appreciates most about the project is its social aspect. She called it \u201ca chosen family\u201d that was formed partly because they were having fun while exercising.",
      "\u201cFitness doesn\u2019t have to be this hard-nosed, drill-sergeant type thing,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can have fun and get fit.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Health officials said Saturday they have confirmed the first U.S. case of a new form of mpox that was first seen in eastern Congo.",
      "The person had traveled to eastern Africa and was treated in Northern California upon return, according to the California Department of Public Health. Symptoms are improving and the risk to the public is low.",
      "The individual was isolating at home and health workers are reaching out to close contacts as a precaution, the state health department said.",
      "Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with a virus that\u2019s in the same family as the one that causes smallpox. It is endemic in parts of Africa, where people have been infected through bites from rodents or small animals. Milder symptoms can include fever, chills and body aches. In more serious cases, people can develop lesions on the face, hands, chest and genitals.",
      "Earlier this year, scientists reported the emergence of a new form of mpox in Africa that was spread through close contact including through sex. It was widely transmitted in eastern and central Africa. But in cases that were identified in travelers outside of the continent, spread has been very limited, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "More than 3,100 confirmed cases have been reported just since late September, according to the World Health Organization. The vast majority of them have been in three African countries \u2014 Burundi, Uganda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.",
      "Since then, cases of travelers with the new mpox form have been reported in Germany, India, Kenya, Sweden, Thailand, Zimbabwe, and the United Kingdom.",
      "Health officials earlier this month said the situation in Congo appears to be stabilizing. The Africa CDC has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the spread, and another 7 million vaccines for the rest of Africa. The spread is mostly through sexual transmission as well as through close contact among children, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups.",

In the U.K., one person died in an E. coli outbreak in June linked to lettuce that sickened at least 275 people. Organic walnuts sickened consumers in 19 states with E. coli infections in April.",

      "Activists waved flags, snapped their fingers, and hummed and mumbled chants in a silent protest, with many covering their mouths with the word \u201cSilenced.\u201d",
      "Demonstrators held up signs calling for more money to be pledged for climate finance, which involves cash for transitioning to clean energy and adapting to climate change. It comes as negotiators at the venue try to hammer out a deal for exactly that \u2014 but progress has been slow and observers say the direction of any agreement is still unclear.",
      "Lidy Nacpil said protestors like her are \u201cnot surprised\u201d about how negotiations are going. But past wins \u2014 like a loss and damage fund that gives developing nations cash after extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change \u2014 keep organizers going, said Nacpil, a coordinator with the Asian Peoples\u2019 Movement on Debt and Development.",
      "\u201cThe role we play is to increase the pressure,\u201d she said of the action. \u201cWe know we\u2019re not going to get the results that the world needs in this round of negotiations, but at least to bring us many steps closer is our hope, is our aim.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cI think we have no option but to keep fighting ... It\u2019s the instinctive response that anyone, any living being, living creatures will have, which is to fight for life and fight for survival.\u201d",
      "Tasneem Essop said she was inspired by the action, which was challenging to organize. \u201cTo be able to pull off something where people feel their own power, exercise their own power and get inspired in this creative way, I\u2019m super excited about this,\u201d she said.",
      "Essop says she\u2019s \u201cnot very\u201d optimistic about an outcome on finance, but knows next week will be pivotal. \u201cWe can\u2019t end up with a bad deal for the peoples of the world, those who are already suffering the impacts of climate change, those who need to adapt to an increasing and escalating crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cWe fight until the end.\u201d",
      "Activists in Baku were joined by protests big and small around the world.",
      "In London, hundreds of protesters marched from the British Museum to the offices of Socar, the Azerbaijan-owned oil company, before heading to the residence and office of Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "Demonstrators with hands painted red chanted, \u201cCop29 stop the lies, greenwashing genocide\u201d and \u201ckeep it in the ground.\u201d",
      "Negotiators at COP29, as the talks are known, are working on a deal that might be worth hundreds of billions of dollars to poorer nations. Many are in the Global South and already suffering the costly impacts of weather disasters fueled by climate change. Several experts have said $1 trillion a year or more is needed both to compensate for such damages and to pay for a clean-energy transition that most countries can't afford on their own.",
      "Samir Bejanov, deputy lead negotiator of this year's climate talks said in a press conference that the climate finance talks were moving too slowly.",
      "\u201cI want to repeat our strong encouragement to all parties to make as much progress as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need everyone to approach the task with urgency and determination.\u201d",
      "Diego Pacheco, a negotiator from Bolivia, said that the amount of money on the table for developing countries needs to be \u201cloud and clear.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo more speeches but real money,\u201d he said.",
      "Observers were also disappointed at the pace of progress.",
      "\u201cThis has been the worst first week of a COP in my 15 years of attending this summit,\u201d said Mohamed Adow, of climate think tank Power Shift Africa. \"There\u2019s no clarity on the climate finance goal, the quality of the finance or how it\u2019s going to be made accessible to vulnerable countries.\u201d",
      "\u201cI sense a lot of frustration, especially among the developing country blocks here,\u201d he said.",
      "Panama environment minister Juan Carlos Navarro agreed, telling The Associated Press he is \u201cnot encouraged\u201d by what he\u2019s seeing at COP29 so far.",
      "\u201cWhat I see is a lot of talk and very little action,\u201d he said, noting that Panama is among the group of countries least responsible for warming emissions but most vulnerable to the damage caused by climate change-fueled disasters.",
      "\u201cWe must face these challenges with a true sense of urgency and sincerity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are dragging our feet as a planet.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Doctors say requests for permanent sterilizations and long-term birth control like IUDs have surged across the nation since Donald Trump was elected president last week",
      "Hours after Donald Trump was elected president for the second time, Dr. Clayton Alfonso had two messages from patients seeking to replace their IUDs. Over the next few days, three women inquired about getting their tubes tied.",
      "All of them said the election was the reason they were making these choices now.",
      "Requests for long-term birth control and permanent sterilizations have surged across the nation since the election, doctors told The Associated Press. And companies that sell emergency contraception and abortion pills say they're seeing significant spikes in requests from people who are stockpiling the medications \u2014 one saw a 966% increase in sales of emergency contraception from the week before in the 60 hours after the election.",
      "\u201cI saw this bump after the Trump election in 2016\" and after Roe vs. Wade was overturned in 2022, said Alfonso, an OB-GYN at Duke University in North Carolina. \u201cBut the patients seem more afraid this time.\u201d",
      "Although anti-abortion advocates are pressing Trump for more restrictions on abortion pills, it's unclear what \u2014 if much \u2014 will be done regarding access to contraceptives of any kind during the second Trump administration. Trump told a Pittsburgh television station in May that he was open to supporting regulations on contraception. But after media reports on the interview, he wrote on his social media platform Truth Social that he \u201chas never and will never\u201d advocate for restricting birth control and other contraceptives.",
      "Alfonso said his patients want to replace still-effective IUDs and \u201crestart\u201d the 3-to-12-year clock on them before the inauguration. He also said the women are particularly concerned about IUDs, which have been attacked by abortion opponents who believe life begins when an egg is fertilized. Experts believe the devices work mostly by blocking fertilization, but also may make it harder for a fertilized egg to implant in the womb.",
      "A patient who requested a tubal ligation Tuesday told Alfonso she doesn\u2019t want kids and is \u201cjust absolutely terrified of either forced pregnancy or inability to access contraception.\"",
      "Pittsburgh OB-GYN and abortion provider Dr. Grace Ferguson said more of her patients are scheduling IUD insertions or stockpiling emergency contraception, telling her upfront that it\u2019s \u201cbecause of the upcoming administration change.\u201d",
      "One patient, Mara Zupko, said she wants prescription emergency contraception since she\u2019s on the cusp of the weight limit for Plan B, the most well-known over-the-counter type. Her husband is getting a vasectomy.",
      "\u201cWe always kind of teetered on whether we wanted children or not,\u201d said Zupko, 27. \u201dBut as the world has become scarier and scarier, we realized we didn\u2019t want to bring a child into that environment. And I also have several health risks.\u201d",
      "Women are also turning to companies that sell emergency contraception online or offer abortion pills mifepristone and misoprostol through telehealth \u2014 something that's been happening even before the election, but that some companies say has accelerated.",
      "A study earlier this year showed the abortion pill supplier Aid Access received about 48,400 requests from across the U.S. for so-called \u201cadvance provision\u201d pills from September 2021 through April 2023 \u2014 with requests highest right after news leaked about Roe being overturned but before the formal announcement. Other research found that more women had their tubes tied post-Roe, with the biggest increases in states that ban abortion.",
      "Mifepristone has a shelf life of about five years and misoprostol around two years, according to Plan C, an organization that provides information about medical abortions. Plan B typically has a shelf life of four years.",
      "Telehealth company Wisp saw orders for abortion pills spike 600% between Election Day and the following day. And between Nov. 6 and 11, the company saw a 460% increase in sales of its emergency contraception and birth control offerings.",
      "At Gen Z-focused Winx Health, which sells emergency contraception called Restart, company leaders saw a 966% increase in sales in the 60 hours following the election compared with the week before. Sales of \u201cvalue packs\u201d of Restart \u2014 four doses instead of one \u2014 were up more than 7,000% in the past week.",
      "\"Morning after pills\u201d are legal in all states, but Winx co-founder Cynthia Plotch said many people seem confused about what emergency contraception is compared to abortion pills. In a 2023 poll by the health policy research organization KFF, a majority of responders said they know these two things aren't the same, but only 27% reported knowing emergency contraceptive pills cannot end a pregnancy.",
      "Doctors agree confusion around morning after pills may explain some of the stockpiling. But Alfonso at Duke suspects most people are doing this for the same reason they are seeking longer-term methods of birth control: to avoid abortion by preventing pregnancy in the first place.",
      "Alfonso predicts the birth control and abortion pill surge may level out like it did in 2016 and 2022. If the new administration \u201cis not focused on health care right away,\" he said, \"then I think it\u2019ll go to the back of people\u2019s minds until it picks up in the media.\u201d",

      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at these climate talks in Baku, Azerbaijan, called COP29",
      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- Good or bad, the United Nations climate negotiations process itself became the focus of the international talks that aim to curb warming from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "Environmental advocates released reports Friday decrying fossil fuel industry influence at the climate talks called COP29. At the same time, a letter signed by a former United Nations secretary-general and ex-top climate negotiators called for dramatic reform. And the conference's chief negotiator said current talks \u2014 aimed at striking a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars to help finance a transition to clean energy and adapting to climate change \u2014 were going too slowly.",
      "All that put the focus on process \u2014 not results.",
      "\u201cWe consider COP29 as a litmus test for the global climate architecture,\" conference lead negotiator Yalchin Rafiyev said at a Friday news conference.",
      "A letter signed by former U.N. chief Ban Ki-Moon, former U.N. climate secretary Christiana Figueres and former Ireland President Mary Robinson called for \u201ca fundamental overhaul of the COP.\"",
      "\"We need a shift from negotiation to implementation,\u201d it said.",
      "Two signees \u2014 Figueres and Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research \u2014 said the letter was being badly misinterpreted as criticism of the climate talks. They said the letter was intended to show support for the process, which they said has worked and just needs to shift into a new mode.",
      "Instead of spending so much effort negotiating new deals in annual conferences that can attract 70,000 people, the process should be smaller and more frequent and aimed at putting what was already agreed upon into action, Rockstrom said.",
      "\u201cIt's about strengthening the COP,\" Rockstrom said. \u201cIt's about recognizing we\u2019ve accomplished so much that we have what we need. ... We really need to get serious about delivery.\"",
      "Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare said he had issues with some of the suggestions in the letter and personally considers the COP process broken. His analysis this week showed that after the 2015 Paris agreement projected future warming dropped, but in the past three years, warming projections \u2014 based on negotiations, promises and policies \u2014 for the future have stayed the same or even gone up slightly.",
      "An analysis from the Kick Big Polluters Out coalition said Friday that the official attendance list of the talks featured at least 1,770 people connected to fossil fuel interests.",
      "Catherine Abreu, director of the International Climate Politics Hub, suggested that there should be a \u201cfirewall\u201d between fossil fuel lobbyists, U.N. climate bodies and negotiators from countries. \u201cWe know over 1,700 fossil fuel lobbyists are here at COP29. That is not acceptable,\u201d she said.",
      "Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, who on Friday presented new data on carbon pollution sites, said \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that the fossil fuel industry and the petrostates have seized control of the COP process to an unhealthy degree.\"",
      "For his part, COP29 negotiator Rafiyev defended the process.",
      "\u201cThe process has already delivered, the COP process so far by reducing projected warming, delivering finance to those in need,\" Rafiev said. \u201cIt\u2019s better than any alternative.\u201d",
      "One key benefit of the U.N. climate talks process is it's the only place where vulnerable small island nations have an equal seat at the table, United Nations Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. But the process has its limits because \u201cthe rules of the game are set by member states,\u201d she said.",
      "At a press conference, Alliance of Small Islands States Chair Cedric Schuster said the negotiating bloc felt the need to remind everyone else why the talks matter.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re here to defend the Paris agreement,\u201d Schuster said, referring to the climate deal in 2015 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned that countries are forgetting that protecting the world\u2019s most vulnerable is at the core of this framework.\u201d",
      "Also at the talks Friday, new data from an organization co-founded by Gore that combines observations and artificial intelligence found that cities in Asia and the United States emit the most heat-trapping gas, with Shanghai the most polluting.",
      "Using observations and artificial intelligence, Climate Trace quantifies heat-trapping carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, as well as other traditional air pollutants worldwide, including for the first time in more than 9,000 urban areas.",
      "Seven states or provinces spew more than 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases, all of them in China, except Texas, which ranks sixth.",
      "Earth's total carbon dioxide and methane pollution grew 0.7% to 61.2 billion metric tons with the short-lived but extra potent methane rising 0.2%. The figures are higher than other datasets \u201cbecause we have such comprehensive coverage and we have observed more emissions in more sectors than are typically available,\u201d said Gavin McCormick, Climate Trace's co-founder.",
      "Shanghai's 256 million metric tons of greenhouse gases led all cities and exceeded those from the nations of Colombia or Norway. Tokyo's 250 million metric tons would rank in the top 40 of nations if it were a country, while New York City's 160 million metric tons and Houston's 150 million metric tons would be in the top 50 of countrywide emissions. Seoul, South Korea, ranks fifth among cities at 142 million metric tons.",
      "\u201cOne of the sites in the Permian Basin in Texas is by far the No. 1 worst polluting site in the entire world,\u201d Gore said. \u201cAnd maybe I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised by that, but I think of how dirty some of these sites are in Russia and China and so forth. But Permian Basin is putting them all in the shade.\u201d",
      "China, India, Iran, Indonesia and Russia had the biggest increases in emissions from 2022 to 2023, while Venezuela, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States had the biggest decreases in pollution.",
      "The dataset \u2014 maintained by scientists and analysts from various groups \u2014 also looked at traditional pollutants such as carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and other chemicals associated with dirty air. Burning fossil fuels releases both types of pollution, Gore said.",
      "This \u201crepresents the single biggest health threat facing humanity,\u201d Gore said.",

      "Seven-year-old Halima Abou Yassine was brought to Lebanon from Gaza for treatment after an Israeli strike left her near death with a gaping wound in her skull",
      "BEIRUT -- When Zarifa Nawfal\u2019s family arrived in Beirut for her wounded daughter\u2019s surgery, one of the first things she wanted to do was go to the sea. The Mediterranean had been a constant companion at their home in Gaza before the war.",
      "\u201cThe moment I smelled the sea, I felt at peace inside \u2014 as if I were in Gaza,\u201d she said.",
      "But soon their place of refuge reminded her of home in far more distressing ways.",
      "Nawfal\u2019s 7-year-old daughter, Halima Abou Yassine, is one of a dozen severely wounded Palestinian children brought to Lebanon this year for treatment through a program launched by a British-Palestinian surgeon, Dr. Ghassan Abu Sitta.",
      "But months after their arrival, Lebanon is itself embroiled in a war some fear will end in Gaza-like destruction.",
      "In February, Nawfal was staying with her five children and her mother in an apartment in central Gaza. They had been displaced from their home in the north and Nawfal\u2019s husband was missing, likely dead.",
      "The children were filling water containers outside when two missiles struck, Nawfal said. She rushed outside and found Halima, the youngest, lying in the street, her skull cracked open, her brain exposed.",
      "Through her shock, Nawfal said, \u201cI was relieved that her body was in one piece.\u201d In Gaza, blasts often ripped people apart, leaving their loved ones without even a body to bury.",
      "Halima\u2019s brother was unconscious next to her. He was quickly revived at the hospital. But staff at Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital confirmed Nawfal\u2019s fears, she said: Halima was dead. Her small body was placed in the morgue.",
      "But as the family was preparing to bury her, the little girl\u2019s uncle noticed faint signs of life, the family said.",
      "Officials at Al-Aqsa hospital could not be reached to confirm the account. But Abu Sitta, who has worked in several Gaza hospitals during the war, said in the chaotic situation it was not uncommon for patients to be misidentified as dead because normal protocols for emergency room examinations were often abandoned.",
      "\u201cBecause of the sheer number of cases that would come in with each air raid ... the ambulance staff would take to the morgue immediately those who they thought were dead,\" he said.",
      "In the days after her daughter was determined to be alive, Nawfal stayed with her, manually pumping oxygen into her lungs. After a week, the little girl began to breathe on her own. Finally, she woke up.",
      "\u201cSome of the doctors cried and said this is a miracle,\u201d Nawfal said.",
      "But they were unable to do more than keep the little girl alive. Her skull was still gaping open, a shard of bone missing. Her brain was beset by infection.",
      "The family was evacuated to Egypt in May. In July, they boarded a plane for Lebanon.",
      "The first of the wounded Palestinian children arrived in Lebanon in May. Five-year-old Adam Afana had nearly lost his left arm in a blast that killed his father and sister. His arm was paralyzed and he needed a complex surgery to correct the nerve damage.",
      "At the time, Lebanon was already embroiled in a low-simmering conflict between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "The Lebanese militant group began firing rockets across the border into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Palestinian militants staged the deadly surprise incursion into southern Israel that sparked the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel responded with shelling and airstrikes.",
      "For months, the conflict in Lebanon was mainly confined to the border area, far from Beirut.",
      "Abu Sitta said he chose Lebanon for the wounded children's treatment because the Mediterranean country has specialists with wide experience treating war injuries.",
      "Lebanon has been through its share of conflicts, including a 15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and a brutal monthlong war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006, as well as spillover effects from other regional conflicts.",
      "\u201cEven after the end of the wars (in Lebanon), the wounded from Iraq and Syria would come here for that kind of complex and multistage treatment,\u201d Abu Sitta said.",
      "In July, Halima underwent successful surgery to repair her skull at the American University of Beirut Medical Center.",
      "Nawfal said her daughter has lingering memory problems but is improving with therapy. A chipper, happy-go-lucky child, Halima thrived in Beirut. She swam in the hotel pool, loved to color and played with the other children from Gaza. She walked with her siblings to pick out fruit at the neighborhood produce stand, a straw hat covering the scar on the back of her head.",
      "In mid-September, Israel launched an offensive against Hezbollah. It pummeled wide swathes of Lebanon with airstrikes, including Beirut\u2019s southern suburbs and some sites within the city center.",
      "The children quickly snapped back into wartime habits. They cracked open the balcony's sliding glass doors to prevent the glass shattering from the pressure of a blast and began sleeping in the central sitting room in the family\u2019s hotel suite, away from windows.",
      "Nawfal said some organizations offered to evacuate the family from Lebanon to continue treatment elsewhere, but she \u201ccompletely refused.\u201d",

      "Adam Afana's uncle, Eid Afana, said the escalation in Lebanon \u201creminds us of the beginning of the war in Gaza.\u201d Afana said the sound of airstrikes frightened Adam, who felt the war was pursuing them.",

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",

      "NEW YORK -- President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday he will nominate anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, putting a man whose views public health officials have decried as dangerous in charge of a massive agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research, Medicare and Medicaid.",
      "\u201cFor too long, Americans have been crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation when it comes to Public Health,\u201d Trump said Thursday in a post on his Truth Social site announcing the appointment. Kennedy, he said, would \u201cend the Chronic Disease epidemic\" and \u201cMake America Great and Healthy Again!\u201d",
      "Trump said Kennedy would target drugs, food additives and chemicals.",
      "As one of the most prominent anti-vaccine activists in the world, Kennedy's nomination immediately alarmed some public health officials.",
      "Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards and see children or adults suffer or lose their lives to remind us that vaccines work, and so I am concerned.\u201d",
      "Trump also announced Thursday that he has chosen Doug Collins, a former congressman from Georgia, to run the Department of Veterans Affairs. Collins is a chaplain in the U.S. Air Force Reserve Command. The Republican served in Congress from 2013 to 2021, and he helped defend Trump during his first impeachment process.",
      "Later Thursday, Trump said he was nominating North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum to lead the Department of the Interior. After ending his own presidential campaign in December 2023, Burgum endorsed Trump and became an outspoken supporter, appearing on TV news shows and at rallies and other events. He was on Trump's short list of potential running mates.",
      "Kennedy hails from one of the nation\u2019s most storied political families and is the son of the late Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the nephew of President John F. Kennedy. He first challenged President Joe Biden for the Democratic nomination last year. He then ran as an independent but abandoned his bid this summer after striking a deal to endorse Trump in exchange for a promise to serve in a health policy role during a second Trump administration.",
      "He and the president-elect have since become good friends. The two campaigned together extensively during the race\u2019s final stretch, and Trump made clear he intended to give Kennedy a major public health role.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to let him go wild on health,\u201d Trump said at a rally last month.",
      "During the campaign, Kennedy told NewsNation that Trump had asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy has pushed against processed foods and the use of herbicides like Roundup weed killer. He has long criticized the large commercial farms and animal feeding operations that dominate the industry.",
      "But he is perhaps best known for his criticism of childhood vaccines.",
      "Again and again, Kennedy has made his opposition to vaccines clear. In July, he said in a podcast interview that \u201cThere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and told FOX News that he still believes in the long-ago debunked idea that vaccines can cause autism.",
      "In a 2021 podcast he urged people to \u201cresist\u201d CDC guidelines that advise when kids should receive routine vaccinations.",
      "\u201cI see somebody on a hiking trail carrying a little baby and I say to him, \u2018Better not get them vaccinated,\u2019\u201d Kennedy said.",
      "Repeated scientific studies in the U.S. and abroad have found no link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines have been proven safe and effective in laboratory testing and in real world use in hundreds of millions of people over decades. The World Health Organization credits childhood vaccines with preventing as many as 5 million deaths a year.",
      "Trump during his first term launched Operation Warp Speed, an effort to speed the production and distribution of a vaccine to combat COVID-19. The resulting vaccines were widely credited, including by Trump himself, with saving lives.",
      "Kennedy has also worked to shore up support among young mothers in particular, on a message of ridding the U.S. of unhealthy ingredients in foods, promising to model regulations after those imposed in Europe. His claims that the U.S. obesity epidemic, as well as a rise in chronic diseases like diabetes, are the result of processed and unhealthy foods has resonated on social media among fitness gurus and mom influencers alike.",
      "It remains unclear how that will square with Trump\u2019s history of deregulation of big industries, including food. Trump has pushed for fewer inspections of the meat industry, for example.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s stance on vaccines raises question about his ability to get confirmed, even in a GOP-controlled Senate. He also has said he would make a controversial recommendation to remove fluoride from drinking water, although fluoride levels are mandated by state and local governments. The addition of the mineral has been cited as leading to improved dental health and is considered safe at low levels.",
      "Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not comment on Trump's pick of Kennedy or any other potential nominee. \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any judgments about any of these folks at this point,\u201d he said.",
      "But Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, R-MO, praised the HHS pick, posting on X: \u201cBad day for Big Pharma! @RobertKennedyJr.\"",
      "Several Democrats quickly condemned the selection.",
      "Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the No. 3 Democrat, said that Kennedy\u2019s confirmation would be \u201cnothing short of a disaster for the health of millions of families.\u201d",
      "But not every Democrat recoiled from the news. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said he was \u201cexcited\u201d for Kennedy to lead HHS. Polis said he wants to see Kennedy take on \u201cbig pharma\u201d and hopes he will \u201clean into personal choice\u201d on vaccines.",
      "That idea is concerning to former New York Public Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan, who said that if people opt against vaccines, deadly viruses could run wild. He points to an uptick in measles outbreaks \u2014 16 have occurred so far this year compared to four last year. \u201cThat\u2019s going to continue if we have someone at the top of our health system that is saying, \u2018I\u2019m not so sure about the science here,\u2019\u201d Vasan said.",
      "FDA could have one of the biggest shakeups, with Kennedy's promises of more regulations \u2014 action that would buck the moves that previous Republican administrations have made. He has promised a crackdown on food dyes and preservatives. And with pharmaceutical companies, he's suggested that drugmakers be barred from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products.",
      "He wants to weaken FDA regulations around a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "Kennedy also will focus on ending the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previously worked for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his former campaign communications manager, Del Bigtree, told the AP last month.",
      "This past weekend, Kennedy said he wanted to fire 600 employees at NIH, which oversees vaccine research and replace them with 600 new people. In separate comments, he has said that in his first week he would order a pause in drug development and infectious disease research, shifting the focus to chronic diseases.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine nonprofit group, Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",

      "A U.S. military watchdog says Navy officials lacked sufficient understanding of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people",
      "HONOLULU -- Navy officials \u201clacked sufficient understanding\u201d of the risks of maintaining massive fuel storage tanks on top of a drinking water well at Pearl Harbor where spilled jet fuel poisoned more than 6,000 people in 2021, a U.S. military watchdog said Thursday.",
      "That lack of awareness came even though officials had engineering drawings and environmental studies that described the risks, the U.S. Department of Defense\u2019s inspector general said.",
      "The finding was among a long list of Navy failures identified by the inspector general in two reports that follow a yearslong investigation into the fuel leak at the Red Hill Bulk Fuel Storage Facility. Investigators said it was imperative for the Navy to address its management of fuel and water systems at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam and recommended that the military assess leak detection systems at other Navy fuel facilities.",
      "\"The DoD must take this action, and others, to ensure that tragedies like the one in November of 2021 are not allowed to repeat,\u201d Inspector General Robert P. Storch said in a statement.",
      "The military built the Red Hill fuel tanks into the side of a mountain in the early 1940s to protect them from aerial attack. There were 20 tanks in all, each about the height of a 25-story building with the capacity to hold 12.5 million gallons (47.3 million liters.) The site was in the hills above Pearl Harbor and on top of an aquifer equipped with wells that provided drinking water to the Navy and to Honolulu's municipal water system.",
      "Fuel leaks at Red Hill had occurred before, including in 2014, prompting the Sierra Club of Hawaii and the Honolulu Board of Water Supply to ask the military to move the tanks to a place where they wouldn't threaten Oahu's water. But the Navy refused, saying the island's water was safe.",
      "The 2021 spill gushed from a ruptured pipe in May of that year. Most of it flowed into a fire suppression drain system, where it sat unnoticed for six months until a cart rammed a sagging line holding the liquid. Crews believed they mopped up most of this fuel but they failed to get about 5,000 gallons (19,000 liters.) Around Thanksgiving, the fuel flowed into a drain and drinking water well that supplied water to 90,000 people at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam.",
      "The inspector general's report noted 4,000 families had to move out of their homes for months because they couldn't drink or bathe in their water. The military spent more than $220 million housing residents in hotels and responding to the spill. Congress appropriated $2.1 billion more, some of which is helping the Navy close the Red Hill facility in compliance with an order from Hawaii regulators.",
      "Among the inspector general's other findings:",
      "1. The Navy never told the state Department of Health, which regulates underground fuel tanks, about the missing fuel after the May 2021 spill. 2. The Navy missed four separate opportunities in November 2021 to activate emergency response plans to respond to the water contamination. That includes on Nov. 20, when fuel was released from the drainage pipe, and on Nov. 28, when residents called base authorities to report chemical and fuel smells emanating from their water. 3. The Navy issued news releases on Nov. 21 and 22 saying \u201cthe drinking water was safe\u201d but did so without conducting any laboratory analysis to confirm that was the case.4. The Navy didn't assume contamination from the spill had spread throughout Pearl Harbor's drinking water system, as required by the water system emergency response plan. The report said some residents may have continued to cook and shower with their tap water as a result.",

      "\u201cIt's outrageous and unacceptable,\u201d said the statement from U.S. Sens. Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz and U.S. Reps. Ed Case and Jill Tokuda, all Democrats.",

      "Walking can help meet the U.S. surgeon general\u2019s recommendation that adults get at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity physical activity every week. This helps lower the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, depression and many types of cancer.",
      "Walking also improves blood sugar levels, is good for bone health and can help you lose weight and sleep better, added Julie Schmied, a nurse practitioner with Norton Healthcare, which runs the free Get Healthy Walking Club.",
      "Another advantage? It\u2019s a low-impact exercise that puts less pressure on joints as it strengthens your heart and lungs.",

      "That's especially important for women\u2019s bone health as they age.",
      "Experts recommend adding such activities at least twice weekly \u2013 using weights, gym equipment or your own body as resistance \u2014 and doing exercises that improve flexibility like yoga or stretching.",
      "Nearly everyone has heard about this walking goal, which dates back to a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan. But experts stress that it\u2019s just a guideline.",
      "The average American walks about 3,000 to 4,000 steps a day and it's fine to gradually work up to 10,000, Shmied said.",
      "Setting a time goal can also be useful. Shmied suggests breaking the recommended 150 minutes per week into 30 minutes a day, or 10 minutes three times a day, for five days. During inclement weather, people can walk in malls or on treadmills.",
      "As they become seasoned walkers, they can speed up the pace or challenge themselves with hills while still keeping the activity level moderate.",

    "summary": "Deep breathing can be a simple and effective way to reduce stress",

      "Deep breathing can be a simple and effective way to reduce stress",
      "NEW YORK -- A simple, uncommon ritual starts each staff meeting at Myosin Marketing. When everyone is gathered on Zoom, and before they get to the meat of the agenda, CEO Sean Clayton leads his team through a deep-breathing exercise.",
      "The practice sets the tone for the meeting, and helps his employees, most of whom work remotely, to feel safe, grounded and willing to take creative risks, he said.",
      "\u201cAt first they thought it was really weird, like, \u2018What are we doing?\u2019\u201d Clayton said. \u201cThere were a lot of cameras off and I\u2019m sure a lot of people were like, \u2018This is awkward.\u2019\" But after a couple of weeks, there was a shift. Employees of the Austin, Texas company were saying, 'This feels good,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Deep breathing can be an effective way to reduce stress at work, studies show. But on the job, many people don\u2019t think about how they\u2019re inhaling and exhaling.",
      "Desk workers sitting a computer tend to take shallow breaths as their shoulders creep up. Workers who spend the day on their feet in retail or health care may be too busy to focus on breathing.",
      "But there's good reason to remember to pause to take deep breaths. Chronic, unmanaged stress, which increases the risk of heart disease and stroke, can be as harmful to our health as secondhand smoke, according to the American Heart Association. Research suggests deep-breathing exercises can lower a person's blood pressure and reduce anxiety.",
      "Other benefits: deep breathing is free, can be done anywhere and doesn't require taking a half-hour to meditate. Spending just a minute or two breathing deeply can help calm racing thoughts, experts say.",
      "\u201cIt relaxes my mind. It makes my mind so full of ease,\u201d Lisa Marie Deleveaux, a marketing professional and mother of five, said. \u201cIt brings you back to the present moment.\u201d",
      "Deleveaux was laid off several months ago and has struggled to find a new job. She wakes most mornings at 4 or 5 a.m., before the children, to do breathing exercises. One is a technique known as alternate nostril breathing, a yoga exercise that involves inhaling through one nostril and out through another, using a thumb or forefinger to hold one nostril closed at a time.",
      "\u201cIf you set a priority for yourself ... you can make the time,\u201d Deleveaux said.",
      "Focusing on breathing for one to five minutes \"can help you clear the slate and wipe all these things out of your mind...and allow you to get back to focusing on the one thing you want to accomplish,\u201d said cardiologist Glenn Levine, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. \u201cThe best analogy is turning your computer off when you have 37 programs (open) and it freezes.\u201d",
      "A good way to do deep breathing exercises is while sitting on a bench outside, Levine said. If that\u2019s not an option, doing it at a desk works.",
      "\u201cEither turn off your screen or just put something blank on the screen so people think you\u2019re still working,\" Levine said. \u201cInstead of focusing on the screen or work, just focus on your breathing. If possible, close your eyes.\u201d",
      "There are other ways to fit in breathing exercises. To get ahead of anxiety before starting a day of cold calls, sales development representative Lindsay Carlisle does breathing exercises with her 7-year-old daughter during the drive to school. They breathe in for seven counts, hold their breath for five, breathe out for seven counts, and then repeat the cycle several times.",
      "\u201cThroughout that process, my shoulders start to drop on their own, and it really is calming,\u201d Carlisle, who lives in Flint, Michigan, said. \u201cI\u2019m not a yoga instructor. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing, but it works.\u201d",
      "Suze Yalof Schwartz was an overworked fashion editor when her mother-in-law taught her a three-minute meditation technique that she says changed her life. She gave up her fashion career and founded Unplug Meditation, a Santa Monica, California, company with a meditation studio, an app and programs for corporate clients.",
      "\u201cWhen we slow down our breath, we send a signal to our brain that everything\u2019s OK, even when it\u2019s not,\" she said.",
      "A 16-second breathing technique she's taught to firefighters, police officers, doctors and others is called the box breathing technique. You breathe in for four counts, hold for four, breathe out for four counts and hold for four.",
      "\u201cIt is the best thing that you can do at work before you have a meeting, before you send out an email that you wish you didn\u2019t send, before you have a difficult conversation, because it just calms you down, gets rid of your negative energy,\" Yalof Schwartz said.",
      "Employers such as Coca-Cola, Mattel and Netflix have hired Unplug Meditation to teach breathing or meditation.",
      "It's not always easy for workers to find space for deep breathing exercises. For example, in retail jobs, workers often mix with customers. Yalof Schwartz recommends doing breathing exercises when ringing up a sale or folding clothes. You can also take a deep breath right before walking through a door.",
      "Office workers can set a timer on their phones to remind themselves to breathe deeply. That's what Carlisle, the sales representative, does. She also keeps a Post-it note on her monitor that says \u201cBreathe.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe anxiety is always going to be there,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cBut at least I know I have one small tool. ... It sounds so simple and silly, but it works.\u201d",

      "MULTAN, Pakistan -- Pakistani authorities introduced mobile clinics and added more beds in hospitals to treat the nearly 70,000 patients received daily with respiratory-related diseases as hazardous smog continued to shroud the country's east, officials said Wednesday.",
      "Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s most populous province with 127 million residents, has been hit by a record-high ongoing wave of pollution since October. The U.N. children\u2019s agency on Monday warned that the health of 11 million children there was at risk.",
      "Lahore and Multan, the province\u2019s two main cities hit by smog, remained the two most polluted cities in the world on Wednesday, with air quality index readings of about 400, according to the Environmental Protection Department. Anything over 300 is considered hazardous to health.",
      "The dangerous smog is a byproduct of large numbers of vehicles, construction and industrial work as well as burning crops at the start of the winter wheat-planting season, experts say.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 200 clinics on board vehicles have been roaming the smog-hit province of Punjab since last week in search of people who can't afford treatment and the elderly who can't make it to hospitals, a top government official at the Health Department, Aun Abbas, said.",
      "Abbas said the mobile clinics are equipped to handle basic laboratory tests and doctors onboard can prescribe medication as needed.",
      "Uzma Bukhari, a spokesperson for the Punjab provincial government, said more than 2.1 million patients affected by smog have so far been treated at state-owned hospitals, adding the number is expected to grow.",
      "Schools in the province have been ordered to shut down until Nov. 17, to protect children, and all parks and museums until Nov. 18. Doctors have urged people to avoid unnecessary travel and wear face masks.",
      "\u201cMost patients with respiratory-related diseases are coming to hospitals because they did not wear face masks,\u201d said Azam Mushtaq, a medical specialist at Nishtar Hospital in Multan told The Associated Press.",
      "Asthma patients seemed to suffer the most as they had a hard time breathing even after being admitted and provided with oxygen support, according to an AP reporter on the scene.",
      "However, many violate the mask mandate and are being fined by authorities. Traffic police also penalize drivers whose vehicles emit smoke.",
      "Weather forecasters predict light rain in some of the areas in Punjab, which can help improve air quality. The government has also said it is looking into methods to induce artificial rainfall to combat the pollution in Punjab.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has picked a prominent vaccine skeptic to lead the nation\u2019s sprawling public health apparatus",
      "President-elect Donald Trump 's plan to appoint Robert F. Kennedy Jr., to lead the Health and Human Services Department will put a prominent vaccine skeptic at the helm of the nation's sprawling public health apparatus.",
      "A scion of a famous Democratic dynasty, Kennedy made a name in his own right as an environmental attorney who successfully took on large corporations including DuPont and Monsanto.",
      "But over the past two decades, he's increasingly devoted his energy to promoting claims about vaccines that contradict the overwhelming consensus of scientists.",
      "Trump would have Kennedy lead a massive Cabinet agency that oversees everything from drug, vaccine and food safety to medical research and the social safety net programs Medicare and Medicaid. He said before the election he would give Kennedy free rein over health policy.",
      "Here's a look at Kennedy and the agency he'll be tasked with leading:",
      "He took over the anti-vaccine group Children's Health Defense and built it into a juggernaut during the pandemic. His activism helped him build a loyal following that he's leveraged in his political pursuits.",
      "Kennedy insists he is not anti-vaccine and claims he has never told the public to avoid vaccination. But he has repeatedly made his opposition to vaccines clear. He said on a podcast \u201cthere\u2019s no vaccine that is safe and effective\u201d and has urged people to resist CDC guidelines on when kids should get vaccinated.",
      "While there are rare instances when people have severe reactions to vaccines, the billions of doses administered globally provide real-world evidence that they are safe. The World Health Organization says vaccines prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year.",
      "He wants to eliminate liability protections for drug companies.",
      "Even before Trump was elected, Kennedy said he would recommend water agencies stop adding fluoride to drinking water. Fluoride strengthens teeth and is viewed as one of the biggest public health successes of the past century.",
      "He made a variety of other claims not backed by science, such as questioning whether HIV causes AIDS and suggesting antidepressants lead to school shootings.",
      "Children\u2019s Health Defense, currently has a lawsuit pending against a number of news organizations, among them The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy took leave from the group when he announced his run for president but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "Kennedy has promised to take a serious look at those who work for HHS and its agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "He is especially focused on putting an end to the \u201crevolving door\u201d of employees who have previous history working for pharmaceutical companies or leave government service to work for that industry, his campaign communications manager Del Bigtree told the AP last month. Bigtree is also an anti-vaccine organizer.",
      "He said he wants to fire 600 employees at the National Institutes of Health, which oversees vaccine research, and replace them with 600 new employees.",
      "Many of the scientists and researchers who work at the NIH are not political appointees, which makes firing them abruptly more difficult. Nevertheless, Kennedy made the promise at the Genius Network Annual Event in Scottsdale, Arizona, according to a video first obtained by ABC News.",
      "\u201cWe need to act fast, and we want to have those people in place on Jan. 20, so that on Jan. 21, 600 people are going to walk into offices at NIH and 600 people are going to leave,\u201d Kennedy said, according to a video of his remarks posted on YouTube.",
      "He says the public health establishment is too focused on infectious diseases and wants to redirect resources toward panoply of problems he characterizes as the chronic disease epidemic, including obesity, diabetes, autism and mental illnesses. He blames them on greedy corporations including drug companies that worry healthy Americans would be bad for their bottom line and food producers using harmful pesticides and additives.",
      "Kennedy's father was Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, brother of President John F. Kennedy. Both men were assassinated.",
      "Kennedy originally ran in the Democratic primary against President Joe Biden before deciding to launch an independent bid. He then suspended that campaign earlier this year and endorsed Trump, who has repeatedly praised Kennedy, promised him influence in a future administration, and vowed to \u201cMake America Healthy Again.\u201d",
      "The GOP base has eagerly welcomed Kennedy since he joined forces with Trump, an embrace Kennedy never received from the Democratic Party. His anti-vaccine activism has alienated him from much of his famous family.",
      "Doctors found a dead parasitic worm in Kennedy's brain and high levels of mercury that he said caused brain fog and memory problems.",
      "He once retrieved a bear that was killed by a motorist and left it in New York\u2019s Central Park with a bicycle on top, sparking a mystery that consumed the city in 2014. A photo showed Kennedy with his fingers in the bear\u2019s bloodied mouth, a mock grimace on his face and an apparent bloodstain on his pantleg.",
      "He denied eating a dog after a friend shared a photo with Vanity Fair showing Kennedy dramatically preparing to take a bite of a charred animal; Kennedy said it was a goat.",
      "And a federal law enforcement agency opened an investigation after Kennedy allegedly cut off the head of a dead whale and took it home two decades ago. The National Marine Fisheries Service ended the probe a short time later.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s nomination is certain to be opposed by the pharmaceutical lobby in Washington, which relies on the predictability of FDA\u2019s science-based rules to bring new medicines to market.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s proposals for the agency bear little resemblance to those of prior Republican administrations, which have typically favored cutting regulations to speed up product approvals.",
      "Instead, Kennedy has suggested barring drugmakers from advertising on TV, a multibillion-dollar enterprise that accounts for most of the industry\u2019s marketing dollars. He\u2019s also proposed eliminating fees that drugmakers pay the FDA to review their products, allowing the agency to hire extra scientists to speed up their work. Replacing those funds would require billions in new appropriations from the federal budget.",
      "In a post last month to the social media platform X, Kennedy vowed to end FDA\u2019s \u201caggressive suppression\u201d of a host of unsubstantiated therapies, including psychedelics and stem cells as well as discredited COVID-era drugs like ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine.",
      "In recent interviews, Kennedy has also suggested clearing out \u201centire departments\u201d at FDA, including the one responsible for nutrition standards.",
      "The Kennedy pick was condemned by public health officials and some congressional Democrats.",
      "\u201cRobert F. Kennedy, Jr., is not remotely qualified for the role and should be nowhere near the science-based agencies that safeguard our nutrition, food safety, and health,\u201d said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the public health watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "But it also won some bipartisan support.",
      "\u201cFinally, someone to detox the place after the Fauci era,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, wrote on the social media platform X, referring to Anthony Fauci, the former leading public health official who has been demonized by people opposed to vaccines and the government's response to COVID-19.",
      "Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said he was \u201cexcited\u201d about Kennedy's appointment and said he would shake up HHS and the FDA.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019m most optimistic about is taking on big pharma and the corporate ag oligopoly to improve our health,\u201d Polis wrote on X. Facing backlash, he later added, \u201cScience must remain THE cornerstone of our nation\u2019s health policy.\u201d"

      "The Texas Supreme Court has ruled against a legislative subpoena that lawmakers used to stave off the execution of Robert Roberson",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A Texas Supreme Court ruling has again cleared the way for the execution of Robert Roberson, who would become the first person in the U.S. to be put to death over a murder conviction tied to a case of shaken baby syndrome, a diagnosis that some medical experts have questioned.",
      "Roberson was convicted of killing his 2-year-old daughter in 2003 and had been slated to die by lethal injection on Oct. 17. But the execution was halted after a bipartisan group of Texas lawmakers, including some who believe Roberson is innocent, issued a last-ditch subpoena ordering Roberson to testify at the Capitol days after his execution date.",
      "The unusual tactic created a legal conundrum that successfully temporarily held off Roberson's execution. However, the Texas Supreme Court on Friday ruled that a legislative subpoena cannot stop an execution, reopening a path for the execution to proceed unless Republican Gov. Greg Abbott grants a 30-day reprieve. A new date hasn't been set yet.",

      "September 2024: A group of nearly 90 Republican and Democratic lawmakers file a clemency petition to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles urging it to spare Roberson's life because they believe his daughter died of severe pneumonia, not abuse. The former lead detective on the case, several medical experts, civil rights advocates and best-selling author John Grisham also signed the petition.",
      "Oct. 16: The parole board votes unanimously, 6-0, to not recommend to grant clemency. Abbott can only grant clemency after receiving a recommendation from the board.

    "story": [
      "Kim Jong Un has renewed his call for a \u201climitless\u201d expansion.",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un renewed his call for a \u201climitless\u201d expansion of his military nuclear program to counter U.S.-led threats in comments reported Monday that were his first direct criticism toward Washington since Donald Trump\u2019s win in the U.S. presidential election.",
      "At a conference with army officials on Friday, Kim condemned the United States for updating its nuclear deterrence strategies with South Korea and solidifying three-way military cooperation involving Japan, which he portrayed as an \u201cAsian NATO\u201d that was escalating tensions and instability in the region.",
      "Kim also criticized the United States over its support of Ukraine against a prolonged Russian invasion. He insisted that Washington and its Western allies were using Ukraine as their \u201cshock troops\u201d to wage a war against Moscow and expand the scope of U.S. military influence, the North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said.",
      "Kim has prioritized his country\u2019s ties to Russia in recent months, embracing the idea of a \u201cnew Cold War\u201d and displaying a united front in Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s broader conflicts with the West.",
      "He has used Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine as a distraction to accelerate the development of his nuclear-armed military, which now has various nuclear-capable systems targeting South Korea and intercontinental ballistic missiles that can potentially reach the U.S. mainland.",
      "Kim has yet to directly acknowledge that he has been providing military equipment and troops to Russia to support its war against Ukraine and the KCNA\u2019s report didn\u2019t mention whether Kim made any comments toward Trump, whose election win has yet to be reported in the North\u2019s state media.",
      "Kim met Trump three times in 2018 and 2019 in Trump\u2019s first presidency, but their diplomacy quickly collapsed over disagreements in exchanging the release of U.S.-led sanctions and North Korean steps to wind down its nuclear and missile program. North Korea has since suspended any meaningful talks with Washington and Seoul as Kim ramped up his testing activity and military demonstrations in the face of what he portrayed as \u201cgangster-like U.S. threats.\u201d There\u2019s concern in Seoul that Kim in exchange for his military support of Russia would receive Russian technology in return to further develop his arsenal.",
      "Trump\u2019s election win has touched off speculation about a resumption of a summit-driven diplomacy with Kim, which was described by critics as a \u201cbromance.\u201d But some experts say a quick return to 2018 is highly unlikely, as too much has changed about the regional security situation and broader geopolitics since then.",
      "While the North Korean nuclear problem was relatively an independent issue during Trump\u2019s first term, it is now connected with broader challenges created by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and further complicated by weakened sanctions enforcement against Pyongyang, Hwang Ildo, a professor at South Korea\u2019s National Diplomatic Academy, wrote in a study last week.",
      "North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile program is now much more advanced, which would increase Kim\u2019s perception of his bargaining powers. Kim\u2019s efforts to boost North Korea\u2019s presence in a united front against Washington could also gain strength if Trump spikes tariffs and rekindles a trade war with China, the North\u2019s main ally and economic lifeline, Hwang said.",
      "Amid the stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with Washington, Kim has been dialing up pressure on South Korea, abandoning his country\u2019s long-standing goal of inter-Korean reconciliation and verbally threatening to attack the South with nukes if provoked.",
      "Kim has also engaged in psychological and electronic warfare against South Korea, such as flying thousands of balloons to drop trash in the South and disrupting GPS signals from border areas near the South\u2019s biggest airport.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said North Korea again flew trash-laden balloons toward the South early Monday and issued a statement warning the North \u201cnot to test our military\u2019s patience any further.\u201d The North has launched about 7,000 balloons toward the South since May, causing property damage but so far no injuries. On at least two occasions, trash carried by North Korea\u2019s balloons fell on Seoul\u2019s presidential compound, raising concerns about the vulnerability of key sites.",

      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- A special tribunal in Bangladesh on Monday told investigators they have one month to complete their work on ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her close aides, who face charges of crimes against humanity after hundreds of people were killed in a mass uprising this summer.",
      "Golam Mortuza Majumdar, the head judge of the three-member International Crimes Tribunal, set Dec. 17 for investigators to finish their work, as the tribunal heard updates Monday from police about what the country's security agencies have done to arrest Hasina and her close aides.",
      "The decision came after prosecutors sought more time for the investigation.",
      "Mohammed Tajul Islam, chief prosecutor of the tribunal, told the judges during Monday's hearing that they were working in line with an extradition treaty signed earlier with India to make Hasina's return possible.",
      "Hasina has been living in exile in India since Aug. 5 when she fled the country amid the student-led protests. The Dhaka-based tribunal on Oct. 17 issued arrest warrants for Hasina and 45 others, including former Cabinet ministers, advisers and military and civil officials. The country is now being run by an interim government headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus.",
      "At least 13 people, including a former law minister and a businessman who was Hasina\u2019s private-sector adviser, appeared before the tribunal on Monday, said B.M. Sultan Mahmud, a prosecutor at the tribunal. One former Cabinet minister was not brought to the tribunal as he was in custody for police interrogation in a separate case. A further six people will appear on Wednesday, tribunal officials said. At least 20 suspects have been arrested in the case.",
      "The tribunal will also seek updates from police on their progress in arresting the other suspects, including Hasina.",
      "After the hearing on Monday, the tribunal\u2019s head judge ordered authorities to send all 13 suspects to jail, pending investigation.",
      "The chief prosecutor of the tribunal has already sought help from Interpol through the country\u2019s police chief to arrest Hasina. On Sunday, Yunus said in an address to the nation that his administration would seek Hasina's extradition from India.",
      "Authorities say hundreds of people were killed during the uprising in July and August, mainly by security agents seeking to quell the initial protests over government jobs. The violence intensified as the protests morphed into an anti-government movement, with more bloodshed, ending Hasina\u2019s 15-year rule. Hasina had also earlier sought an investigation into the killings."

      "An Australian accused of smuggling amphetamines in a suitcase has appeared in a Japanese court nearly two years after her arrest and said she was tricked into carrying them as part of an online romance scam",
      "CHIBA, Japan -- An Australian accused of smuggling amphetamines in a suitcase appeared in a Japanese court on Monday nearly two years after her arrest, saying she is innocent and that she was tricked into carrying them as part of an online romance scam.",
      "Donna Nelson from Perth, Australia, was arrested at Japan\u2019s Narita International Airport just outside Tokyo when customs officials found about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of stimulants, or phenylaminopropane, hidden in a double-bottom suitcase she was carrying.",
      "Nelson, 58, said she received the suitcase from an acquaintance of a man she met on social media in 2020, and brought it from Laos to Tokyo as instructed. She was supposed to meet up with the man in Japan but he never showed up, according to prosecutors.",
      "She was arrested on the spot and later charged with violating the stimulants control and customs laws. She has been in custody for nearly two years.",
      "Monday\u2019s trial comes just weeks after the recent acquittal of an 88-year-old former boxer, Iwao Hakamada, who was on death row for about half a century on wrongful murder convictions. That case rekindled concerns about Japan\u2019s largely closed-door investigation processes and lengthy trials.",
      "Nelson, in a brief statement at the Chiba District Court near Tokyo, said she did not know the drugs were hidden in the suitcase and that she was carrying them for a man she thought she loved. The man told her he was the Nigerian owner of a fashion business and paid for her trip to Japan via Laos, her lawyers said.",
      "Prosecutors acknowledged the case is linked to a romance scam but accused Nelson of smuggling the drugs, claiming she knew the contents of the suitcase.",
      "A verdict is expected on Dec. 4.",
      "Nelson entered the courtroom escorted by a pair of uniformed guards who removed her handcuffs and a rope around her waist as she took a seat to stand trial. She repeatedly looked toward her daughters who were seated in the audience.",
      "It was an emotional moment for her and her family to see each other for the first time since her arrest.",
      "One of Nelson\u2019s daughters, Kristal Hilaire, said she wants the court to know her mother is a good person.",
      "\u201cShe thought she was coming to Japan for her love story. She didn\u2019t have any other intentions other than that. And that\u2019s what we need everyone to know and hear at the court this week,\u201d Hilaire said.",
      "The daughter added that the family is \u201cjust trying to be strong because when mom locks her eyes with us, I want her to feel our strength and that she will feed off that.\u201d",
      "Nelson\u2019s lawyer Rie Nishida said that customs officials' limited English-language ability might have led to mistranslations and the accusation that Nelson knew what she was carrying.",
      "In Monday's trial, a customs official testified that his colleague was mainly asking questions to Nelson in English but ended up calling an interpreter and what she had said earlier was only summed up in Japanese during an interview that was not recorded.",
      "Nishida asked the judges and a jury panel of citizens to carefully listen to Nelson, who she said was finally given a capable court interpreter, to make a fair judgement.",

      "The state Main Sanitary Inspectorate in a statement said the presence of the virus does not necessarily mean people have been sick, but those who have not been vaccinated against polio could be at risk. The vaccinations are free in Poland for people under 19.",
      "New measures also include more intensive testing of Warsaw's sewage, renewing the vaccination stocks and updating the list of children still unvaccinated. Polio is most often spread by contact with waste from an infected person or, less frequently, through contaminated water or food.",
      "The polio virus mostly affects children under 5. Most people infected don\u2019t have symptoms, but in severe cases, polio can invade the nervous system and cause paralysis within hours, according to the World Health Organization. It estimates that 1 in 200 polio cases results in permanent paralysis, usually of the legs.",
      "Poland's inspectorate said about 86% of the country's 3-year-olds have been vaccinated against polio and that vaccinating at least 95% of children can prevent the spread of the virus. Poland has seen the rise of anti-vaccination movements among some parents, which has worried health officials.",
      "The statement said Poland's last case of polio was in 1984."

      "The Oct. 26 election kept the governing Georgian Dream party in power, but opponents say the vote was rigged with Russia's assistance. Many Georgians viewed the election as a referendum on the country\u2019s effort to join the European Union. Several large protests have been held since then.",

The party recently pushed through laws similar to those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "On Sunday, demonstrators closed an avenue leading into the center of Tbilisi. Nika Melia, leader of Coalition for Change, one of the opposition groups, voiced hope that the protests around the clock will mark \u201cthe beginning of the intense, strong protest movement that will finish with the fall of Ivanishvili\u2019s regime.\u201d",
      "The EU suspended Georgia\u2019s membership application process indefinitely in June after the country\u2019s parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as \u201cpursuing the interest of a foreign power,\" similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.",

European election observers said the election took place in a \u201cdivisive\u201d atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence."

      "Lebanon\u2019s state-run National News Agency said two missiles hit the area of Zoqaq al-Blat neighborhood \u2013 where local U.N. headquarters and Lebanon\u2019s parliament and prime minister\u2019s office are located.",
      "Since late September, Israel has dramatically escalated its bombardment of Lebanon, vowing to severely weaken the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant group and end its barrages in Israel that the militants have said are in solidarity with Palestinians during the war in Gaza.",
      "The U.S. has been working on a cease-fire proposal that would remove Israeli ground forces from Lebanon and push Hezbollah forces far from the Israeli border. Lebanon\u2019s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally who is mediating for the militants, is expected to meet with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein in the Lebanese capital on Tuesday.

      "Many areas in central Beirut, including Zoqaq al-Blat, have become a refuge for many of the roughly 1 million people displaced by the ongoing conflict in southern Lebanon and the southern suburbs of Beirut. The strike also occurred near a Hussainiye, a Shia mosque.",
      "The target of the airstrike remained unclear, and the Israeli army did not issue a prior warning. Ambulance sirens echoed through the streets as an Associated Press photographer on the scene saw significant casualties on the street.",
      "It was the second consecutive day of Israeli strikes on central Beirut after more than a month-long pause.

      "HONG KONG -- Dozens of prominent Hong Kong pro-democracy activists are scheduled to be sentenced Tuesday in the largest case under a national security law that critics say crushed political activism in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.",
      "The convictions of the 45 activists under the Beijing-imposed law are widely seen as part of a crackdown by China that destroyed hopes for a more democratic Hong Kong. They face sentences of up to life imprisonment.",
      "The activists were among 47 people charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in 2021 for their involvement in an unofficial primary election to pick opposition candidates. They were accused of agreeing to veto government-proposed budgets indiscriminately after securing a legislative majority to force a dissolution of the legislature and then the ouster of the city's leader.",
      "Three government-approved judges ruled that the plan to achieve political change through the unofficial primary in 2020 would have undermined the government\u2019s authority and created a constitutional crisis.",
      "Thirty-one of the activists pleaded guilty and 14 others were found guilty in May following a trial. Two were acquitted. Those who entered guilty pleas have a better chance of shorter prison terms.",
      "Some of the convicted activists have sought lesser sentences by expressing remorse and apologizing. Others have remained defiant.",
      "Here are profiles of some of the leading activists.",
      "Riding on a wave of anti-government protests in 2019, Benny Tai, a former law professor at the University of Hong Kong, co-organized the primary election that drew 610,000 voters \u2014 over 13% of the city\u2019s registered electorate. The primary was aimed at selecting pro-democracy candidates who would then run in the official election.",
      "The judges said Tai stated that acquiring a legislative majority was a \u201cconstitutional weapon of mass destruction\" that would allow the pro-democracy camp to veto government budgets. Under the city\u2019s Basic Law, or mini-constitution, the city leader can dissolve the legislature if a budget cannot be passed. But the leader must step down if the budget is again blocked by the next legislature.",
      "The judges said Tai aimed to \u201cundermine, destroy or overthrow the existing political system and structure\u201d of Hong Kong.",
      "Tai pleaded guilty to the charge. In seeking a shorter sentence, his lawyer said Tai always supported non-violence and believed his actions were legal.",
      "Tai was not always viewed as a threat by authorities. He was a member of a consultative committee that helped collect views on the drafting of the Basic Law before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.",
      "In 2001, the government awarded him a medal of honor for promoting civic education, though it was withdrawn in 2022.",
      "Tai is perhaps best known as a co-founder of the city\u2019s 2014 Occupy Movement, during which demonstrators occupied streets and brought traffic to a standstill in some areas for nearly 80 days, demanding direct elections for the city\u2019s leader.",
      "Joshua Wong rose to fame in Hong Kong in 2012 as a high school student leading protests against the introduction of national education in the city\u2019s schools. Two years later, he became world famous as a leader of the Occupy Movement.",
      "In 2016, Wong co-founded a political party named \u201cDemosisto\u201d with fellow young activists Nathan Law and Agnes Chow. In the 2019 pro-democracy movement, Wong helped seek overseas support for the protests. His activism led Beijing to label him an advocate of Hong Kong's independence who \u201cbegged for interference\u201d by foreign forces.",
      "Demosisto disbanded when Beijing imposed the security law in 2020. Wong won in the primary election, but the government postponed the official election, citing public health risks during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Wong has pleaded guilty and asked for a lesser sentence. His lawyer said he hoped \u201che could part with his history and would be able to reform himself\u201d after completing it.",
      "Wu Chi-wai is the former chair of Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party, which some activists saw as too moderate. In 2006, the government awarded Wu a medal of honor for community service.",
      "Wu entered a guilty plea, with his lawyer saying he has been in public service for over 30 years and that he and his party did not seek indiscriminate vetoing of budgets. Three former government officials wrote letters seeking a reduced sentence for him.",
      "Wu's parents passed away during his detention and he could only briefly attend their funerals.",
      "Gordon Ng, a dual citizen of Australia and Hong Kong, was initially named an organizer of the primary by prosecutors, an accusation Ng denied. He pleaded not guilty.",
      "The judges acknowledged in their verdict that Ng did not organize the plan and was not a candidate. However, they pointed to his campaign urging voters to support primary winners through social media posts and a front-page advertisement in the now-shuttered pro-democracy Apple Daily newspaper, founded by Jimmy Lai.",
      "In seeking a lesser sentence, Ng said his support for the primary was linked to his belief that it could address the differences within the pro-democracy camp, which had long been plagued by infighting. He said he never asked candidates to promise to veto budgets.",

    "story": [
      "Survivors of clergy sexual abuse are urging the Vatican to adopt the same zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002",
      "ROME -- Survivors of clergy sexual abuse urged the Vatican on Monday to expand its zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002 to the rest of the world, arguing that children everywhere should be protected from predator priests.",
      "The U.S. norms, adopted at the height of the abuse scandal there, say a priest will be permanently removed from church ministry based on even a single act of sexual abuse that is either admitted to or established under church law.",
      "That \u201cone strike and you\u2019re out\u201d policy in the U.S. has long stood out as the toughest in the church. It is held up by some as the gold standard, by others as excessive and by still others as imperfect but better than most. It was adopted by U.S. bishops as they scrambled to try to regain credibility following the revelations of abuse and cover-up in Boston documented by the Boston Globe\u2019s \u201cSpotlight\u201d series.",
      "Since then, the church abuse scandal has erupted globally, and survivors from around the world said Monday there\u2019s no reason why the U.S. norms couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be applied universally. They called for changes in the church\u2019s in-house canon law and reasoned they could be approved since the Holy See already approved the norms for the U.S. church.",
      "\u201cDespite Pope Francis\u2019 repeated calls for zero tolerance on abuse, his words have yet to lead to any real action,\u201d said Gemma Hickey, a transgender survivor of abuse and the president of the global survivor network Ending Clergy Abuse.",
      "The proposal launched at a press conference was hammered out during an unusual meeting in June in Rome between survivors and some of the Catholic hierarchy's top priestly experts on preventing abuse. It was described by participants at the time as a \u201chistoric collaboration\u201d between two groups that often talk past one another, given victims' deep distrust of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "The priestly participants in that meeting included the Rev. Hans Zollner, who heads the church\u2019s main academic think tank on safeguarding; the No. 2 at the Vatican\u2019s child protection advisory board, Bishop Luis Manuel Ali Herrera; and the Gregorian University\u2019s canon law dean, the Rev. Ulrich Rhode as well as diplomats from the U.S., Australian and other embassies.",
      "However, there was apparently no one from the Vatican legal office, secretariat of state or the discipline section of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which processes all abuse cases worldwide and largely sets policy on applying the church\u2019s canon law \u2014 albeit in secret since its cases are never published.",
      "As a result, it was unclear what would become of the proposed policy changes, given the U.S. norms only came about because U.S. bishops pushed the Vatican to approve them, driven by their outraged flocks and insurance companies.",
      "Nicholas Cafardi, a U.S. canon lawyer who was an original member of the U.S. National Review Board that provided input to the 2002 U.S. norms, said globalizing that policy into universal church law \u201cwould be one of the logical next steps\u201d for Francis to take to continue the fight against abuse.",
      "But Cafardi, author of \u201cBefore Dallas,\u201d about the lead-up to the 2002 Dallas bishops' meeting that approved the norms, said that some bishops today bristle at how the policy limits their authority and freedom. And in a telephone interview, he noted that even in the U.S., the norms are only still in place because the U.S. bishops keep formally asking to keep them, which he acknowledged was a \u201cweakness\u201d in the system.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that a good protection would be \u2018Let\u2019s just make it universal law,\u2019\u201d said Cafardi. \u201cOnce you have that law, you don\u2019t have to worry about the bishops asking for it in country after country. It\u2019s just the law.\"",
      "However, the proposal faces an uphill battle since the Vatican in recent years has repeatedly insisted on \u201cproportionality\u201d in its sentences for abuse, refusing to apply a one-size-fits-all approach and taking into account cultural differences in countries where abuse isn't as openly discussed as it is in the West.",
      "That has resulted in seemingly light punishments for even confirmed cases of abuse which, in the U.S., would have resulted in a priest being permanently removed from ministry.",

      "\u201cIt is obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps, and they have been talking about this, to continue adding fuel to the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions around this conflict,\u201d spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.",
      "The scope of the new firing guidelines isn\u2019t clear. But the change came after the U.S., South Korea and NATO said North Korean troops are in Russia and apparently are being deployed to help Moscow drive Ukrainian troops from Russia\u2019s Kursk border region.",
      "Biden\u2019s decision almost entirely was triggered by North Korea's entry into the fight, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, and was made just before he left for the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru.",
      "Russia also is slowly pushing Ukraine\u2019s outnumbered army backward in the eastern Donetsk region. It has also conducted a devastating aerial campaign against civilian areas in Ukraine.",
      "Peskov referred journalists to a statement from President Vladimir Putin in September in which he said allowing Ukraine to target Russia would significantly raise the stakes.",
      "It would change \u201cthe very nature of the conflict dramatically,\u201d Putin said at the time. \u201cThis will mean that NATO countries \u2014 the United States and European countries \u2014 are at war with Russia.\u201d",
      "Peskov claimed that Western countries supplying longer-range weapons also provide targeting services to Kyiv. \u201cThis fundamentally changes the modality of their involvement in the conflict,\u201d he said.",
      "Putin warned in June that Moscow could provide longer-range weapons to others to strike Western targets if NATO allowed Ukraine to use its allies' arms to attack Russian territory. After signing a treaty with North Korea, Putin issued an explicit threat to provide weapons to Pyongyang, noting Moscow could mirror Western arguments that it\u2019s up to Ukraine to decide how to use them.",
      "\u201cThe Westerners supply weapons to Ukraine and say: \u2018We do not control anything here anymore and it does not matter how they are used,\u2019\" Putin has said. \"Well, we can also say: \u2018We supplied something to someone \u2014 and then we do not control anything.\u2019 And let them think about it.\u201d",
      "Putin has also reaffirmed Moscow\u2019s readiness to use nuclear weapons if it sees a threat to its sovereignty.",
      "Biden's move will \u201cmean the direct involvement of the United States and its satellites in military action against Russia, as well as a radical change in the essence and nature of the conflict,\u201d Russia's Foreign Ministry said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, has raised uncertainty about whether his administration would continue military support to Ukraine. He has also vowed to end the war quickly.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave a muted response Sunday to the approval that he and his government have been requesting for over a year, adding, \"The missiles will speak for themselves.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe longer Ukraine can strike, the shorter the war will be,\u201d Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said Monday ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting marking the 1,000th-day milestone.",
      "Asked whether the United Kingdom would follow the United States in authorizing use of its longer-range missiles, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who chaired the meeting, declined to comment. He said doing so would risk \u201coperational security and can only play into the hands of Putin.\u201d",
      "Consequences of the new policy are uncertain. ATACMS, which have a range of about 300 kilometers (190 miles), can reach far behind the about 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line in Ukraine, but they have relatively short range compared with other types of ballistic and cruise missiles.",
      "The policy change came \u201ctoo late to have a major strategic effect,\u201d said Patrick Bury, a senior associate professor in security at the University of Bath in the United Kingdom.",
      "\u201cThe ultimate kind of impact it will have is to probably slow down the tempo of the Russian offensives which are now happening,\u201d he said, adding that Ukraine could strike targets in Kursk or logistics hubs or command headquarters.",
      "Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, agreed the U.S. move would not alter the war's course, noting Ukraine \"would need large stockpiles of ATACMS, which it doesn\u2019t have and won\u2019t receive because the United States\u2019 own supplies are limited.\u201d",
      "On a political level, the move \u201cis a boost to the Ukrainians and it gives them a window of opportunity to try and show that they are still viable and worth supporting\u201d as Trump prepares to take office, said Matthew Savill, director of Military Sciences at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "The cue for the policy change was the arrival in Russia of North Korean troops, according to Glib Voloskyi, an analyst at the CBA Initiatives Center, a Kyiv-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThis is a signal the Biden administration is sending to North Korea and Russia, indicating that the decision to involve North Korean units has crossed a red line,\u201d he said.",
      "Russian lawmakers and state media bashed the West for what they called an escalatory step, threatening a harsh response.",
      "\u201cBiden, apparently, decided to end his presidential term and go down in history as \u2018Bloody Joe,\u2019\u201d lawmaker Leonid Slutsky told Russian news agency RIA Novosti.",
      "Vladimir Dzhabarov, deputy head of the foreign affairs committee in the upper house of parliament, called it \"a very big step toward the start of World War III\u201d and an attempt to \u201creduce the degree of freedom for Trump.\u201d",
      "Russian newspapers offered similar predictions of doom. \u201cThe madmen who are drawing NATO into a direct conflict with our country may soon be in great pain,\u201d Rossiyskaya Gazeta said.",
      "Some NATO allies welcomed the move.",
      "President Andrzej Duda of Poland, which borders Ukraine, praised the decision as a \u201cvery important, maybe even a breakthrough moment\u201c in the war.",
      "\u201cIn the recent days, we have seen the decisive intensification of Russian attacks on Ukraine, above all, those missile attacks where civilian objects are attacked, where people are killed, ordinary Ukrainians,\u201d Duda said.",
      "Easing restrictions on Ukraine was \u201ca good thing,\u201d said Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna of Russian neighbor Estonia.",
      "\u201cWe have been saying that from the beginning \u2014 that no restrictions must be put on the military support,\u201d he told senior European Union diplomats in Brussels. \u201cAnd we need to understand that situation is more serious (than) it was even maybe like a couple of months ago.\u201d",
      "But Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, known for his pro-Russian views, described Biden\u2019s decision as \u201can unprecedented escalation\u201d that would prolong the war.",

      "Brazil is pushing for concerted action to alleviate hunger as it hosts a summit of the Group of 20 leading economies amid global uncertainty over two major wars and incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump",
      "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil pushed for concerted action to alleviate hunger Monday as it hosted a summit of the Group of 20 leading economies amid global uncertainty over two major wars and incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva welcomed foreign leaders to Rio de Janeiro\u2019s modern art museum Monday morning and delivered an opening address that focused on fighting food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIt is for those of us here, around this table, to face the undelayable task of ending this stain that shames humanity,\u201d Lula told his colleagues. \u201cThat will be our biggest legacy.\u201d",
      "Heightened global tensions and uncertainty about an incoming Trump administration ahead of the summit already had tempered expectations for a strongly worded statement addressing the conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine. Further dimming prospects of consensus, Argentina\u2019s negotiators challenged some of the draft language.",
      "That has left experts anticipating a final document focused on social issues like the eradication of hunger \u2014 one of Brazil\u2019s priorities.",
      "\u201cLaunching the global alliance (against hunger) was Brazil\u2019s main objective. That was the main point, it was Brazil\u2019s first priority. But other priorities have fallen by the wayside without achieving concrete results, which frustrates Brazil a little,\u201d said Paulo Velasco, an international relations professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIt will be difficult to have detailed criticism against Russia or Israel regarding the two wars that could impede consensual support, which is definitely not what Brazil wants.\u201d",
      "After Lulathwarted far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro 's reelection bid in 2022, there was some excitement in the international community at the prospect of the leftist leader and savvy diplomat hosting the G20. Bolsonaro had little interest in international summits, let foreign policy be guided by ideology and clashed with several leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Lula took office and often quoted a catchphrase: \u201cBrazil is back.\"",
      "Under Lula, Brazil has reverted to its decades-old principle of nonalignment to carve out a policy that best safeguards its interests in an increasingly multipolar world, even as his administration's foreign policy has at times raised eyebrows.",
      "For the first time ever, Argentina has signed the G20 declaration while dissociating itself from certain aspects, its presidency said in a statement posted to X. Its objections related to limiting freedom of expression on social media; infringement on national sovereignty by institutions of global governance; and greater state intervention to fight hunger, its statement said.",
      "One official from Brazil and one from another G20 nation say Argentine negotiators most vehemently opposed a clause calling for a global tax on the superrich \u2014 which they had previously accepted, in July \u2014 and another promoting gender equality. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Last month, Argentina alone opposed a declaration of the G20 working group on female empowerment, preventing consensus. While Lula received heads of state Monday with smiles and warm embraces, he and Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei stood at arms' length while briefly shaking hands. Milei is an avid Trump supporter.",
      "Trump\u2019s win in the U.S. presidential election earlier this month and the imminent return of an \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine may also hamper the diplomatic spirit needed for broad agreement on divisive issues, analysts said.",
      "Ambassador Mauricio Lyrio, Brazil\u2019s key negotiator at G20, told reporters earlier this month that Lula's launch of a global alliance against hunger and poverty on Monday is just as important as the final statement. As of Monday, 82 nations had signed on to the plan, Brazil\u2019s government said. It is also backed by organizations including the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",
      "A demonstration Sunday on Rio\u2019s Copacabana beach featured 733 empty plates spread across the sand to represent the 733 million people who went hungry in 2023, according to United Nations data, and calling on leaders to take action.",
      "\u201cBrazil wanted a global deal to fight poverty, a project to finance green transition and some consensus over a global tax for the superrich. Only the first one has survived,\u201d according to Thomas Traumann, a former government minister and a political consultant based in Rio.",
      "Be that as it may, Lula reiterated his call for a tax on billionaires at the start of leaders\u2019 afternoon session.",
      "\"Taxation of 2% on the total assets of superrich individuals could generate funds of about $250 billion per year to be invested in facing up to social and environmental challenges all over the world,\u201d Lula said.",
      "U.S. President Joe Biden attended the summit after a stop in Lima for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. He also traveled over the weekend to Manaus, a city in Brazil's Amazon rainforest. It was the first time a sitting American president set foot in the Amazon.",
      "The White House announced Sunday a $50 million contribution to the Amazon Fund, the most significant international cooperation effort to preserve the rainforest, after a prior $50 million. Biden\u2019s administration announced plans last year to give $500 million.",
      "White House officials have said Biden also would use the summits to press allies to not lose sight of finding an end to the wars in Lebanon and Gaza and to keep up support for Ukraine as it tries to fend off Russia\u2019s invasion. Looming large on Monday was news of Biden's decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of longer-range U.S. missiles to allow that country\u2019s military to strike more deeply inside Russia.",
      "During the summit, Biden pointed to his soon-to-end administration\u2019s efforts on global hunger and poverty. He urged counterparts to redouble efforts to ease those ills, as well as to resolve wars in Sudan, Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe United States strongly supports Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Everyone around this table in my view should, as well,\u201d Biden said.",
      "Biden had intended to be part of the G20's group photo, a set piece at most international summits, but it occurred earlier than scheduled, according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to comment publicly. He missed it, along with Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni and Canada's Justin Trudeau, the current and next leaders of the G7 group.",
      "Any commitments Biden makes at the G20 may be overturned by the next White House administration. Trump\u2019s election may also cause some countries to look toward China as a more reliable partner. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with China's Xi Jinping on Monday, the first meeting between British and Chinese leaders since 2018, seeking to repair relations with Beijing.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin is the summit\u2019s most notable absentee. The International Criminal Court has issued a warrant that obliges member states to arrest him. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attended the meeting.",
      "In a plaza a few blocks away, hundreds of demonstrators gathered to denounce the killings in Gaza, some beating drums and chanting \u201cLong live the fight of the Palestinian people!\u201d Among them were two rabbis who traveled from New York. Israel isn\u2019t a G20 member.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to get the message to the G20, to the leaders of the world,\u201d said Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss, from the Neturei Karta International movement. \u201cIt is so critical. We are witnessing the mass murder of people and it is being perpetuated in the name of my religion, of Judaism. We cannot be silent, we dare not be silent.\u201d",

      "It will \u201callow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States,\u201d the Philippine defense department said.",
      "Neither side provided more details or released a copy of the agreement.",
      "Two Philippine security officials, however, have told The Associated Press that such an agreement, similar to ones Washington has signed with other allied countries, would allow the U.S. to provide the Philippines with higher-level intelligence and more sophisticated weapons, including missile systems.",
      "It would also provide the Philippine military access to U.S. satellite and drone surveillance systems with an assurance that such intelligence and details about sophisticated weapons would be kept highly secure to prevent possible leaks, the two Philippine officials said on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive issue publicly.",
      "Philippine efforts to obtain sophisticated weapons from the U.S. military in the past have been hampered by a lack of such an intelligence deal, including when Filipino forces were scrambling to fight a 2017 siege by Filipino and foreign militants aligned with the Islamic State group in southern Marawi city. Philippine forces, backed by U.S. and Australian spy planes, quelled the uprising after five months.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Typhoon Man-yi left at least seven people dead in a landslide, destroyed houses and displaced large numbers of villagers before blowing away from the northern Philippines, worsening the crisis wreaked by multiple back-to-back storms, officials said Monday.",
      "Man-yi was one of the strongest of the six major storms to hit the northern Philippines in less than a month and had sustained winds of up to 195 kilometers (125 miles) per hour when it slammed into the eastern island province of Catanduanes on Saturday night.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. In Manila and offered his prayers, announcing an additional $1 million in humanitarian aid for typhoon victims. He told Marcos he has authorized U.S. troops to help Filipino forces provide lifesaving aid.",
      "Torrential rains and fierce wind unleashed by Man-yi set off a landslide early Monday in the northern town of Ambaguio in Nueva Vizcaya province that buried a house and killed seven people, including children, and injured three others inside, regional police chief Brig. Gen. Antonio P. Marallag Jr. said.",
      "Army troops, police and villagers were scrambling to search for three other people who were believed to have been entombed in the avalanche of mud, boulders and uprooted trees, Marallag said.",
      "Disaster response officials said they were checking if the deaths of two villagers in a motorcycle accident and an electrocution were directly related to Man-yi\u2019s onslaught so they could be added to the overall death toll. They said a separate search was underway for a couple and their child after their shanty was swept away in rampaging rivers in northern Nueva Ecija province.",
      "More than a million people were affected by the typhoon and two previous storms, including nearly 700,000 who fled their homes and moved to emergency shelters or relatives' homes, according to the Official of Civil Defense.",
      "Nearly 8,000 houses were damaged or destroyed and more than 100 cities and towns were hit by power outages due to toppled electric posts, it said.",

      "Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Shuntaro Tanikawa, who pioneered modern Japanese poetry, poignant but conversational in its divergence from haiku and other traditions, has died. He was 92.",
      "Tanikawa, who translated the \u201cPeanuts\u201d comic strip and penned the lyrics for the theme song of the animation series \u201cAstro Boy,\u201d died Nov. 13, his son Kensaku Tanikawa said Tuesday. The cause of death, at a Tokyo hospital, was old age.",
      "Shuntaro Tanikawa stunned the literary world with his 1952 debut work \u201cTwo Billion Light Years of Solitude,\u201d a bold look at the cosmic in daily life, sensual, vivid but simple in its use of everyday language. Written before Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019 \u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\u201d it became a best-seller.",
      "Tanikawa\u2019s \u201cKotoba Asobi Uta,\u201d or \u201cWord Play Songs,\u201d is a rhythmical experiment in juxtaposing words that sound similar, such as \u201ckappa,\u201d a mythical animal and \u201crappa,\u201d a horn, that makes for a joyful singsong compilation, filled with alliterations and onomatopoeia.",
      "\u201cFor me, the Japanese language is the ground. Like a plant, I place my roots, drink in the nutrients of the Japanese language, sprouting leaves, flowers and bearing fruit,\u201d he said in a 2022 interview with The Associated Press at his Tokyo home.",
      "Tanikawa explored the poetic, not only in the repetitive music of the spoken word but also the magic hidden in little things.",
      "One of his works is titled, \u201cI wanted to talk to you in the kitchen in the middle of the night.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the past, there was something about it being a job, being commissioned. Now, I can write as I want,\u201d he said.",
      "In every work Tanikawa tackled, including the script for Kon Ichikawa\u2019s \u201cTokyo Olympiad, a documentary film of the 1964 Tokyo Games, the respectful love for the beauty of the Japanese language resonates.",
      "He also translated Mother Goose, Maurice Sendak and Leo Lionni. Tanikawa has in turn been widely translated, including English, Chinese and various European languages.",
      "Some of his works were made into picture books for children and they are often featured in Japanese school textbooks. He also incorporated Japanese words derived from foreign origins into his poems like Coca-Cola.",
      "\u201cTanikawa\u2019s poetry reflects a metaphysical and quasi-religious attitude toward experience. In simple, spare language, he sketches profound ideas and emotional truths,\u201d according to the Poetry Foundation, a U.S. literary organization.",
      "Tanikawa was born in 1931, a son of philosopher Tetsuzo Tanikawa, and began writing poetry in his teens, circulating with the famous poets of that era, like Makoto Ooka and Shuji Terayama.",
      "He said he used to think poems descended like an inspiration from the heavens. But, as he grew older, he felt the poems welling up from the ground.",
      "In person, Tanikawa was friendly and unassuming, often reading in public with other poets. He never seemed to take himself too seriously but used to confess his one regret in life was never finishing his education, having dropped out amid stardom at a young age.",
      "His relative isolation from the bleakly serious scholarly poetry scene of postwar Japan likely helped him take his free-verse approach that went on to innovate and define Japanese contemporary poetics.",
      "Tanikawa said he wasn\u2019t afraid of death, implying he perhaps meant to write a poem about that experience, too.",

    "story": [
      "After 1,000 days of war, a makeshift memorial has grown in the heart of Kyiv with thousands of blue-and-yellow flags honoring soldiers who died defending Ukraine",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Before Russia\u2019s invasion, this was an ordinary green lawn in the heart of Ukraine\u2019s capital. Tourists would visit to take photos, and locals would stroll there on weekends.",
      "But 1,000 days of war have transformed it into a makeshift memorial, dotted with blue-and-yellow flags \u2014 each honoring a soldier who died fighting Russia. Many were volunteers who left their civilian lives behind to answer to defend their country.",
      "Their loved ones, left alone with grief, hope their sacrifices won\u2019t be forgotten. They plant small, simple flags, hand-marked with the names and dates they died. Over time, the flags have multiplied, fluttering in the wind as the seasons change and the war drags on.",
      "\u201cI put it so that someone might pass by and see that this person once lived and gave their life for us,\u201d said Svitlana Kirichenko, who traveled from Cherkasy to replace the weathered flag she had planted over a year ago in honor of her son, who died fighting. She carefully placed a new one in its place.",
      "\u201cSo we can live peacefully among our own people, and not have Russians dictate how we should live and what to do.\u201d",
      "Associated Press archives show that the first flags appeared on the lawn in May of the war\u2019s first year, shortly after Russian forces withdrew from the Kyiv region and the capital was no longer under the threat of occupation. Photos from that time show dozens of flags neatly arranged in rows across the grassy field.",
      "As the war continued, the place has transformed. The grass has faded away, replaced by well-worn paths resembling those in a cemetery, winding through thousands of flags. Among them, many portraits have appeared \u2014 brought by relative \u2014 showing confident, smiling faces in military uniforms.",
      "Svitlana Kanevska, cloaked in a black hood against the drizzly autumn rain, bent over a portrait of her boyfriend, Serhii Ivanytskyi, who had died months earlier in eastern Ukraine. The photo \u2014 a selfie he had sent her during one of their chats \u2014 showed him standing in a sunlit Ukrainian field. Kanevska carefully wiped droplets from the image.",
      "Since Serhii joined the army early in the war, their time together had been scarce, mostly confined to messages. He kept his location and activities hidden, and their conversations centered largely on love.",
      "Last December, during a brief leave in Kyiv, they passed by this very memorial. \u201cHe said he felt so sorry for the guys,\u201d Kanevska recalled. He was killed in the summer of 2024.",
      "\u201cYou feel so much pain that you don\u2019t know where to go or what to do,\u201d she said. That\u2019s what brought her here months ago, to place his flag and photo among the countless others. Kanevska, who works nearby, often visits to mourn.",
      "She\u2019s not alone. The place is strewn with fresh and dried flowers, a concentration of grief and an epicenter of Ukrainian history. Independence Square, after all, has long been the heart of Ukraine\u2019s revolutions. For many, it is the only fitting place for their loved ones to be remembered.",
      "City authorities have no control over this memorial. It was created by people themselves, driven by a deep need to honor their fallen in the absence of an official government memorial.",
      "Soldiers and families come here to sit for long stretches, gazing quietly into the distance. New flags are added almost daily.",
      "Nearby, funeral ceremonies take place almost every day, followed by moments of silence. Passersby stop, kneel and observe in quiet reverence. But soon, life in the capital moves on, returning to its usual pace.",
      "The memorial keeps growing with each passing day, a reminder of the price Ukraine pays for its freedom.",
      "\u201cIf someone thinks of him, it brings him light where he is. He knows he hasn\u2019t been forgotten,\u201d said Andrii Pedychenko, who came to the memorial to put a new flag for his friend who was killed in action about one year ago. \u201cEach flag is a tragedy. And it reminds us that this is just a small piece because there wouldn\u2019t be enough space here for everyone.\u201d",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- Australia\u2019s Resolute Mining said Monday it would pay $160 million to Mali\u2019s ruling junta to resolve a tax dispute, more than a week after the company\u2019s CEO and two employees were detained in the West African country.",
      "Earlier this month, the Australian gold mining company\u2019s CEO Terence Holohan and the two others were detained in Mali's capital Bamako on Nov. 8 as they were visiting the country for talks over an unspecified dispute. The government did not say why they were detained.",
      "Andrew Wray, the company\u2019s non-executive chairman, said in a statement published on Resolute Mining\u2019s website that all claims against the company made by Malian authorities, \u201cincluding those related to tax, customs levies, maintenance and management of offshore accounts\u201d are settled.",
      "The company will pay Mali $80 million from \u201cexisting cash reserves,\" with an additional payment of $80 million in the \u201ccoming months,\" he added.",
      "Resolute said the company's CEO and two employees were \u201csafe and well,\u201d and that it was working with Mali's authorities for their release.",
      "The Australian company has been working for years at Mali\u2019s Syama gold mine, a large-scale operation in the country\u2019s southwest. It holds an 80% stake in mine, while the Malian government holds the remaining 20%.",
      "The arrest is the latest controversy in Mali\u2019s foreign-dominated and crucial mining sector, increasingly scrutinized by the military authorities. Four employees of Canadian company Barrick Gold also were detained for days in September.",
      "Mali is one of Africa's leading gold producers, but has struggled for many years with jihadi violence and high levels of poverty and hunger. The military seized power in 2020 and since then the junta has placed foreign mining companies under growing pressure as it seeks to shore up the government's revenues."

      "The defendants are accused of transferring babies to neonatal units of 19 private hospitals where the infants were allegedly kept for prolonged and sometimes unnecessary treatments. At least 10 newborns are alleged to have died in the past year due to neglect or malpractice in facilities that were unprepared to treat them.",
      "Prosecutors at the trial, which opened in Istanbul on Monday, say the defendants also falsified reports to make the babies\u2019 condition appear more serious with the aim obtaining payments from the social security institution.",
      "The main defendants have denied any wrongdoing, insisting they made the best possible decisions and face punishment for unavoidable unwanted outcomes.",
      "The case, which emerged last month, has sparked public outrage and calls for a greater oversight of the health care system. Authorities have since revoked the licenses and closed nine of the 19 hospitals that were implicated in the scandal.",
      "Dr. Firat Sari, the main defendant who operated the neonatal intensive care units of several private hospitals in Istanbul, is facing a sentence of up to 583 years in prison.",
      "He is charged with establishing an organization with the aim of committing a crime, defrauding public institutions, forgery of official documents, and homicide by negligence.",
      "During questioning by prosecutors, Sari denied accusations that the babies were not given the proper care, that the neonatal units were understaffed or that his employees were not appropriately qualified, according to a 1,400-page indictment.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. will allow Ukraine to use American-supplied longer-range weapons to conduct strikes inside Russian territory",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- The U.S. will allow Ukraine to use American-supplied longer-range weapons to conduct strikes deeper inside Russian territory, a long-sought request by Kyiv.",
      "It isn't yet clear if there are limits on Ukraine's use of the Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, as there have been on other U.S. missile systems. Their deployment could \u2014 at least initially \u2014 be limited to Russia's Kursk region, where Ukrainian troops seized territory earlier this year.",
      "Since the first year of the war, Ukrainian leaders have lobbied Western allies to allow them to use advanced weapons to strike key targets inside Russia \u2014 which they hope would erode Moscow\u2019s capabilities before its troops reach the front line and could make it more difficult for the Russian forces to strike Ukrainian territory. It could also serve as a deterrent force in the event of future cease-fire negotiations.",
      "The U.S. has long opposed the move, with President Joe Biden determined to avoid any escalation that he felt could draw the U.S. and other NATO members into direct conflict with nuclear-armed Russia. The Kremlin warned on Monday that the decision adds \u201cfuel to the fire.\u201d",
      "The decision comes in the waning days of Biden\u2019s presidency, before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. Trump has said he would bring about a swift end to the war, which many fear could force unpalatable concessions from Kyiv.",
      "The ballistic missiles, developed by U.S. aerospace and defense company Lockheed Martin, have nearly double the striking distance \u2014 up to 300 kilometers (190 miles) \u2014 of most of the weapons in Ukraine's possession. They carry a larger payload and have more precise targeting for pinpoint attacks on air fields, ammunition stores and strategic infrastructure.",
      "The United States has supplied Ukraine with dozens of ATACMS (pronounced attack-ems) and they have been used to destroy military targets in Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine such as Crimea \u2014 but not on Russian soil.",
      "Biden authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS to strike deeper inside Russia, according to a U.S. official and three other people familiar with the matter.",
      "The longer-range missiles are likely to be used in response to North Korea\u2019s decision to send troops to support Kremlin forces, according to one of the people familiar with the development. Pyongyang\u2019s troops are apparently being deployed to help the Russian army drive Ukrainian forces out of Russia\u2019s Kursk border region, where they launched an incursion in August.",
      "The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the U.S. decision publicly.",
      "It was the second time that Washington has expanded Ukraine's authority to use its U.S.-provided weapons systems inside Russian territory.",
      "In May, after Russia\u2019s offensive into the Kharkiv region threatened to stretch Ukrainian forces thin, Biden permitted the use of HIMARS systems \u2014 with a range of 80 kilometers (50 miles) \u2014 to quell that advance. That decision helped Ukrainian soldiers stabilize the fight for a time by forcing Russian forces to pull back military assets.",
      "Ukraine has been asking its Western allies for longer-range weapons in order to alter the balance of power in a war where Russia is better resourced, and strike with precision air bases, supply depots and communication centers hundreds of kilometers (miles) over the border.",
      "It hopes the weapons would help blunt Russia\u2019s air power and weaken the supply lines it needs to launch daily strikes against Ukraine and to sustain its military ground offensive into Ukraine.",
      "If used in Kursk, the weapons would likely require Russian forces preparing for counterattacks to push back valuable equipment and manpower and complicate battle plans.",
      "In lieu of Western weapons, Ukraine has been regularly striking Russia with domestically produced weapons, with some capable of traveling up to 1,000 kilometers (620 miles), but still lacks sufficient quantities to do serious long-term harm.",
      "Ukrainian leaders are being cautious about the announcement \u2014 and senior U.S. defense and military leaders have persistently argued that it won't be a gamechanger. They also have noted that Russia has moved many key assets out of range.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe one capability is going to be decisive and I stand by that comment,\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said, noting that the Ukrainians have other means to strike long-range targets.",
      "Analysts have also suggested the effect could be limited.",
      "\u201cToday, many in the media are talking about the fact that we have received permission to take appropriate actions. But blows are not inflicted with words. Such things are not announced. The rockets will speak for themselves,\u201d said Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of the announcement.",
      "The effect of the decision depends on the rules set for the weapons' use.",
      "If strikes are allowed across all of Russia, they could significantly complicate Moscow's ability to respond to battlefield demands.",
      "If strikes are limited to the Kursk region, Russia could relocate its command centers and air units to nearby regions, blunting the effect of those logistical challenges. That would also mean many of the valuable targets Ukrainian officials have expressed desire to hit may still be beyond reach.",
      "Either way, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Charlie Dietz has noted the ATACMS wouldn\u2019t be the answer to the main threat Ukraine faces from Russian-fired glide bombs, which are being fired from more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) away, beyond the ATACMS' reach.",
      "In addition, the overall supply of ATACMS is limited, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference \u2014 though some proponents say that even a few strikes deeper inside Russia would force its military to change deployments and expend more of its resources.",
      "Jennifer Kavanagh, director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, said the U.S. decision would not alter the course of the war.",
      "\u201cTo really impose costs on Russia, Ukraine would need large stockpiles of ATACMS, which it doesn\u2019t have and won\u2019t receive because the United States\u2019 own supplies are limited,\" she said. \u201cMoreover, the biggest obstacle Ukraine faces is a lack of trained and ready personnel, a challenge that neither the United States nor its European allies can solve and that all the weapons in the world won\u2019t overcome.\u201d",
      "In addition to it being unclear what, if any, restrictions the U.S. will impose on the weapons\u2019 use, it\u2019s also not known how many the U.S. will give to Ukraine.",
      "While the U.S. has provided ATACMS to Ukraine in various military aid packages, the Defense Department will not disclose how many have been sent or exactly how many of those missiles the Pentagon has. Estimates suggest the U.S. has a number that is in the low thousands.",
      "The recent American election raises questions over how long this policy will be in place. Trump has repeatedly criticized the Biden administration\u2019s spending to support Ukraine \u2014 and could reverse moves like this one.",
      "On the other hand, it\u2019s also not clear whether other allies might step up: The decision may encourage Britain and France to allow Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles, also known as SCALP missiles, with a range of 250 kilometers (155 miles).",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Suspected attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a Panama-flagged bulk carrier traveling through the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, though no damage or injuries were reported, authorities said Monday.",
      "The attacks come as the rebels continue their monthslong assault targeting shipping through a waterway that typically sees $1 trillion in goods pass through it a year over the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and Israel\u2019s ground offensive in Lebanon.",
      "The bulk carrier Anadolu S first had been contacted over VHF radio by someone claiming to be authorities in Yemen, demanding the ship turn around, said the Joint Maritime Information Center, a multinational task force overseen by the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe vessel did not comply with the order and continued its transit,\u201d the center said.",
      "The ship's captain later saw that \u201ca missile splashed in close proximity to the vessel\u201d as it traveled in the southern Red Sea near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait connecting to the Gulf of Aden in the first attack late Sunday night, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in an alert. The attack happened some 30 miles (48 kilometers) west of Yemen port city of Mocha.",
      "On Monday, another attack some 70 miles (112 kilometers) southeast of Aden in the Gulf of Aden similarly saw a missile splash down close to the vessel, the UKMTO said.",
      "\u201cThe vessel and crew are safe and proceeding to its next port of call,\u201d the UKMTO added.",
      "The Houthis did not immediately claim the attacks. However, it can take the rebels hours or even days to acknowledge their assaults.",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign, which also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. The Joint Maritime Information Center said the Anadolu S had an \u201cindirect association to Israel.\u201d However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.",
      "The Houthis have shot down multiple American MQ-9 Reaper drones as well.",
      "In the rebels' last attack on Nov. 11, two U.S. Navy warships targeted with multiple drones and missiles as they were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but the attacks were not successful."

      "PASTEF is projected to win around 131 out of the 165 seats in the National Assembly, according to local media and citizen vote counting platforms, giving Faye\u2019s party an absolute majority. The official results and number of seats won by each party will be announced later this week.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Fossil fuel executive Chris Wright, Donald Trump's choice for Energy secretary, is a strong supporter of oil and gas development, including fracking, a key pillar of the president-elect\u2019s quest for U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market.",
      "Wright has been one of the industry\u2019s loudest voices against efforts to fight climate change, and he could give fossil fuels a boost, including quick action to end a year-long pause on natural gas export approvals by the Biden administration.",
      "CEO of Denver-based Liberty Energy, he describes himself as \u201ca tech nerd turned entrepreneur\u201d and promotes the idea that more fossil fuel production can lift people out of poverty around the globe.",
      "Here are some things to know about Wright.",
      "Wright has been chairman and CEO of Liberty Energy since 2011 and has no experience in government.",
      "Liberty is a major energy industry service provider, with a focus on technology. Wright, who grew up in Colorado, earned an undergraduate degree at MIT and did graduate work in electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley and MIT. In 1992, he founded Pinnacle Technologies, which helped launch commercial shale gas production through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.",
      "He later served as chairman of Stroud Energy, an early shale gas producer, before founding Liberty Resources in 2010.",

      "If confirmed, Wright will join North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, Trump\u2019s choice to be interior secretary, as a key player on energy policy in a second Trump term. Wright will be a member of a new National Energy Council that Burgum will chair. The new panel will seek to establish U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d around the world, Trump said.",
      "The energy council will include all executive branch agencies involved in energy permitting, production, generation, distribution, regulation and transportation, with a focus on \u201ccutting red tape\u201d and boosting domestic energy production, Trump said. The council\u2019s mission represents a near-complete reversal from actions pursued by Democratic President Joe Biden, who has made fighting climate change a top priority.",
      "Trump has pledged to rescind unspent funds in Biden\u2019s 2022 climate law and is widely expected to curb or reverse Biden\u2019s push for more electric vehicles and stricter regulation of carbon pollution from coal-fired power plants.",
      "Wright has won support from influential conservatives, including oil and gas tycoon Harold Hamm.",
      "Hamm, executive chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, a major shale oil company, is a longtime Trump supporter and adviser who played a key role on energy issues in Trump\u2019s first term. Hamm helped organize an event at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in April where Trump reportedly asked industry leaders and lobbyists to donate $1 billion to Trump\u2019s campaign, with the expectation that Trump would curtail environmental regulations if reelected.",
      "Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group that supports fossil fuels, called Wright \u201can excellent choice\u201d for energy secretary. Pyle led Trump\u2019s energy transition team in 2016.",
      "Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry\u2019s top lobbying group, also praised Wright, saying the group looks forward to working with him \u201cto bolster American geopolitical strength\" by lifting Biden's pause on LNG export permits and ensuring \u201copen access\" for American energy around the world.",
      "Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called Wright an energy innovator who played a key role in America\u2019s fracking boom.",
      "Wright has frequently criticized what he calls a \u201ctop-down\u201d approach to climate change by liberal and left-wing groups. He argues that the climate movement around the world is \u201ccollapsing under its own weight.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe Energy Department should be doing all it can to develop and expand the energy sources of the 21st century, not trying to promote the dirty fuels of the last century,\u201d Wong said. \u201cGiven the devastating impacts of climate-fueled disasters, DOE\u2019s core mission of researching and promoting cleaner energy solutions is more important now than ever.\u201d",
      "Lena Moffitt, executive director of Evergreen Action, another environmental group, said Wright has \u201cshown that his loyalty lies with fossil fuel interests. Yet he would be tasked with overseeing billions in clean energy investments that are critical to lowering costs and creating jobs nationwide.

    "story": [
      "A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas is being asked to disqualify a winning bid made by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "A company affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a federal judge on Monday to disqualify a bid by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, alleging fraud and collusion.",
      "The company, First United American Companies, which is affiliated with a Jones website that sells dietary supplements, was the only other bidder at the recent auction, offering $3.5 million. In a filing in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, a lawyer for the company asked the judge to declare it the winning bidder instead of The Onion.",
      "The lawyer, Walter Cicack, claimed that the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the auction improperly colluded with The Onion and families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in naming The Onion the winning bidder. Cicack also alleged the trustee violated rules for the sale set by the judge, and said the company's cash offer was twice the amount of The Onion's.",
      "The bankruptcy auction was held last week as part of the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars. Proceeds from the sale will go to Sandy Hook families and other creditors. Jones filed bankruptcy in 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits filed by the families for calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Chicago-based Global Tetrahedron, issued a statement Monday through a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed he\u2019s lashing out by creating conspiracies, but we\u2019re also not surprised,\u201d he said, referring to Jones.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee appointed to oversee the sale, Christopher Murray, declined to comment Monday. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, Christopher Mattei, also declined to comment.",
      "In a response filed in court later Monday, Murray called the allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d He said the motion by First United American to disqualify The Onion was \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Murray also wrote, \u201cHaving failed in its prior efforts to bully the Trustee and his advisors into accepting its inferior bid, FUAC now alleges, without evidence, collusion and bad faith in an attempt to mislead the Court and disqualify its only competition in the auction.\u201d",
      "Murray filed separate court papers Monday asking the judge to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion.",
      "Monday's filing by First United American Companies included the formal bid submitted by The Onion, revealing that it offered $1.75 million for Infowars along with certain incentives by Sandy Hook families who won their defamation lawsuit against Jones. The families agreed to forgo up to 100% of their share of the Infowars sale proceeds and give it to other Jones creditors.",
      "With the families' offer, other Jones creditors would get a total of $100,000 more than they would get if First United American Companies bought Infowars, according to The Onion's bidding document.",
      "Murray told the bankruptcy judge during a court hearing Thursday that the families' incentives made it a better offer than the one by the Jones-affiliated company.",
      "\u201cThe creditors ended up significantly better off,\u201d Murray told the judge, adding that one of his responsibilities was to maximize value for creditors.",
      "Judge Christopher Lopez, who said he had questions about the sale process and concerns about transparency, ordered a hearing to see exactly what happened with the auction and how the trustee chose The Onion. The date of the hearing has not been set.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Collins posted a series of comments about the auction on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\u201cLong and short of it: We won the bid and \u2014 you\u2019re not going to believe it \u2014 the previous InfoWars folks aren\u2019t taking it well,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Collins said last week that The Onion planned to turn the Infowars website into a parody site, taking aim at conspiracy theorists and other social media personalities while promoting gun violence prevention efforts.",
      "Cicack also said in Monday's court filing that the trustee improperly changed the auction process \u201cfrom a live auction to a secret process.\u201d Cicack said that after sealed bids were submitted Nov. 8, it was expected that there would be a round of live bidding on Nov. 13.",
      "But instead, he said, Murray decided to ask the two bidders to submit another offer as their final and best proposal, which they did. Murray then chose from those final bids without holding a round of live bidding. He alleged Murray violated the auction rules.",
      "Lopez's 20-page order on the sale procedures, issued in September, made such a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "Cicack called the Sandy Hook families' portion of The Onion's bid \u201cMonopoly\u201d money with no value.",
      "\u201cIt is also the product of impermissible collusion with the Onion in an effort to \u2018rig\u2019 the auction with the goal of achieving a specific result desired by the Connecticut Families,\u201d he wrote."

    "summary": "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "French farmers have escalated their protests against the EU-Mercosur trade agreement under negotiation",
      "BEAUVAIS, France -- French farmers escalated protests Monday against the European Union-Mercosur trade agreement under negotiation, citing fears of unfair competition. Backed by their government, they argue the deal would threaten their livelihoods by allowing a surge of South American agricultural imports produced under less stringent environmental standards.",
      "In Beauvais in northern France, dozens of farmers with about 50 tractors disrupted traffic before walling up a government office tasked with enforcing environmental standards. The protesters dumped manure and tires in front of the building and moved to the local prefecture, where they set up a noisy camp with firecrackers.",
      "\u201cThe government slept on its agriculture, so we won\u2019t let them sleep,\" said R\u00e9gis Desrumaux, 54, head of the FDSEA Oise farmer's union. \" Last year, we protested for the same reasons: too much paperwork, overly strict norms, not enough help from the state. Now, with unfair competition from South American products boosted with hormones and GMOs, it\u2019s the final straw.\"",
      "Armelle Fraiture, a 25-year-old who took over her family's 300-cow farm in the Beauvais region earlier in the year, expressed concerns about the prospect of South American beef products hitting the French market.",

      "Kevens Dawson Jr.'s body was found inside the Givaudan Color Sense plant after rescuers returned to the building late in the night at the family's urging, Dawson's girlfriend, Malaika Watson, told reporters Monday.",
      "The Nov. 12 afternoon explosion at the factory that makes colorings for the food industry rocked the surrounding neighborhood, left two workers dead and injured 11. Dozens of homes around the plant in eastern Louisville had their windows shattered and the percussion from the blast knocked pictures off walls and cracked drywall in some homes. Investigators said Monday they believe a cooking vessel in the plant overheated, causing the blast.",

      "Dawson's family said he worked at the plant for just over a year and would have turned 50 years old this week. He had three adult children.",
      "Watson became emotional as she recounted how she was told to go to three different hospitals to see if Dawson had been admitted. She was told there were two workers in critical condition, but neither was Dawson. She returned to the site of the plant at around 7 p.m., but was turned away by officers at the scene.",
      "\u201cI just wanted to go in,\u201d she said.",

      "A special response team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives conducted a multi-day investigation and said Monday that preliminary findings indicate it was a cooking vessel that overheated.

      "Just days after announcing a civil fine against Ford for moving too slowly on a recall, the U.S. government unveiled two investigations into recalls that may not have worked or covered enough vehicles.",
      "The largest of the probes covers about 457,000 Ford Bronco Sport SUVs and Maverick small pickups. In April Ford recalled certain 2021 through 2024 Bronco Sports and 2022 through 2023 Mavericks were recalled because they can suddenly lose power.",
      "There have been five complaints from owners whose vehicles lost power after getting the recall fix, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a document posted Monday. The agency will investigate whether the recall was effective. The power loss has been blamed on degraded 12-volt batteries.",
      "The other probe covers about 113,000 Ford Expeditions from 2019 through 2020. Ford recalled about 78,000 of the SUVs in February because the driver and front passenger seat belts can tighten up and hold people with no crash apparent.",
      "The agency says it has complaints about the problem occurring from three owners whose vehicles were not part of the recall. Investigators will check to see if the recall should be expanded.",
      "Ford said it's cooperating in both investigations.",
      "On Thursday NHTSA announced that Ford Motor Co. will pay a penalty of up to $165 million for moving too slowly on a recall and failing to give the agency accurate recall information.",
      "The agency said the civil penalty is the second-largest in its 54-year history. Only the fine Takata paid for faulty air bag inflators was higher.",
      "NHTSA said Ford was too slow to recall vehicles with faulty rearview cameras, and it failed to give the agency complete information, which is required by the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act.",

      "One of the top remaining vacancies in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s proposed Cabinet is his treasury secretary \u2014 and the views of his top contenders there reflect broader questions about how the president-elect might wield tariffs in his new administr...",
      "WASHINGTON -- President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s decision on a treasury secretary is about far more than whose name will be printed on America\u2019s money.",
      "The choice of how to fill his highest-profile outstanding Cabinet selection will be the clearest indication yet of how he intends to wield import tariffs in his new administration.",
      "The leading candidates for the role have expressed differing perspectives on how Trump should use the protectionist trade policies that he put front and center in his campaign for the White House, while Trump himself has offered seemingly contradictory views.",
      "Billionaire investor Scott Bessent, considered a leading candidate, has talked up tariffs as a negotiating ploy. Another prominent contender, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, has expressed more support for broad tariffs. Lutnick is co-chair of Trump\u2019s transition operation and is helping put forward candidates for key roles, including the Treasury Department.",
      "Trump is also looking at other potential candidates as he decides who can best implement his economic agenda \u2014 and how big a role tariffs will play.",
      "The president-elect, during this year\u2019s campaign, portrayed the taxes on imports as both a negotiating tool to hammer out better trade terms and as a way to generate revenue to fund tax cuts elsewhere.",
      "The Republican has proposed universal tariffs of as much as 20% and taxing Chinese imports at 60% or more, yet his campaign never filled in key details about how tariffs would be imposed and whether the goal was more about funding the government or pressing trade partners.",
      "The two are competing priorities \u2014 achieving sustainable long term revenues from tariffs isn't possible if they're a negotiating tool, and sustaining them for the long term could constrain the growth Trump has promised to bring to the country.",
      "The lack of clarity has spilled over to Trump's choice of treasury secretary, as tariffs run the risk of worsening inflation and also disrupting the stock market gains since the election that have been a point of pride for the president-elect.",
      "Bessent told Bloomberg News in August that he views tariffs as a \u201cone time price adjustment\u201d and \u201cnot inflationary,\u201d and that tariffs imposed during a second Trump administration would be directed primarily at China.",
      "In a Fox News op-ed last week, Bessent said that tariffs are \u201ca useful tool for achieving the president\u2019s foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to U.S. exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\u201d",
      "An advocate for imposing wide-ranging tariffs, Lutnick told CNBC in September that \u201ctariffs are an amazing tool for the president to use \u2014 we need to protect the American worker.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, Elon Musk, who has been an influential voice at Trump's side during the transition, came out in favor of Lutnick on his social media site X.",
      "\u201cMy view fwiw is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas @howardlutnick will actually enact change,\u201d Musk posted. \u201cBusiness-as-usual is driving America bankrupt, so we need change.\u201d",
      "Higher tariffs also carry serious risks for the incoming Trump presidency, despite Trump's promises to the public that they will lead to more factory jobs and stronger growth.",
      "The import taxes could upset trade partners and start a trade war. They could anger investors and cause stocks to slide. They could alienate voters who backed Trump because of frustration over higher prices only to find that their coffee, T-shirts, cars and other goods all cost more.",
      "In August, the economists Mary Lovely and Kimberly Claussing found that a 60% tariff on China and separate 20% universal tariff would cost a typical U.S. household $2,600 annually.",
      "Corporate America is keeping an anxious watch on Trump\u2019s transition operation at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and trying to figure out how to respond in the meantime.",
      "To be sure, picking one or the other doesn\u2019t mean Trump won\u2019t take a different path once in the White House, as was seen in his first term.",
      "That has left companies telling investors that they\u2019re planning on a wide range of scenarios, with many focused on reducing their reliance on China.",
      "When asked what policies Trump would require his treasury secretary to implement on day one, his transition team said it was focused on personnel choices.",
      "\u201cPresident-elect Trump is making decisions on who will serve in his second administration,\" said Karoline Leavitt, the transition spokeswoman and incoming White House press secretary. \"Those decisions will continue to be announced by him when they are made.\u201d",
      "Major companies going into this month's election were accepting of a degree of uncertainty on tariffs, saying that they were making plans for a range of outcomes.",
      "Donald Allan, Jr., CEO of the tool-maker Stanley Black & Decker, said on an Oct. 29 earnings call that his company has been planning for the possibility of higher tariffs since the spring. He stressed there are still a lot of unknowns, but his company was unlikely to move more manufacturing jobs into the United States because \u201cit's just not cost effective to do.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is which scenario is going to play out and exactly how that would be. Is it going be just China? Is it going to be every country?\u201d Allan said. \u201cThose are all things that are to be determined.\"",
      "Timothy Boyle, Chairman and CEO of Columbia Sportswear, said on his Oct. 30 earnings call that his company was \u201cvery concerned\u201d about tariffs despite having a minimal exposure to Chinese imports.",
      "\u201cWe believe the arguments about tariffs improving the domestic production of items such as footwear and apparels are fallacious\u201d Boyle said.",
      "The furnishings and home goods store Williams Sonoma said about half of its imports came from China in 2018 when Trump was last president, a number that has since fallen to 25% and could drop further if tariffs are expanded.",
      "But Constellation Brands, a producer and marketer of alcoholic beverages, noted that its business was up double digits four years in row when Trump was last in the White House. CEO William Newlands played down the risk that Trump would hit Mexico with tariffs, even though Trump has talked about new tariffs on Mexican factories and the country is preparing for that possibility.",
      "Constellation is betting that Trump will mainly aim at China.",
      "\u201cThe general belief is that if there was going to be a situation related to tariffs, it\u2019s highly likely that Mexico is not the main target \u2014 it\u2019s China,\u201d Newlands said.",

      "With Thanksgiving less than two weeks away, food retailers are trying to tempt Americans who haven't recovered from recent price inflation",
      "NEW YORK -- With Thanksgiving less than two weeks away, Walmart, Target, Aldi and other grocers are competing for a place on holiday tables with turkey dinner deals and other promotions to tempt Americans who haven't recovered from recent food price inflation.",
      "Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest food retailer, first bundled the makings of a traditional turkey feast into a meal deal three years ago. This year, the 29-item offer, which includes a frozen turkey and ingredients for side dishes, costs less than $55 and is intended to serve eight. That calculates to less than $7 per person.",
      "Target\u2019s version for four people costs $20, $5 less than the company's 2023 Thanksgiving meal, and includes a frozen turkey, stuffing mix and canned green beans and canned jellied cranberry sauce. Aldi\u2019s offers a frozen Butterball turkey with gravy mix as well as pumpkin ingredients for pumpkin pie and ingredients for side dishes like sweet potato casserole. The German-owned supermarket chain priced it for $47 and said that was less than it charged for the same items in 2019.",
      "Meijer, with more than 500 supercenters in the Midwest, jumped into the fray last week by offering a frozen turkey for 49 cents per pound or lower and a $37 Thanksgiving family meal for a group of four to six.",
      "Comparing the respective menus to determine which represents the best value is difficult since recommended serving sizes and contents vary. But the promotions, introduced earlier than ever and at a time when many households remain put off by higher prices, underscore the importance of Thanksgiving to grocers, analysts said.",
      "While consumer perceptions of grocery prices is based on the cost of staples like eggs and milk, \u201cthe Thanksgiving meal has become essentially a new benchmark,\u201d Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, a global marketing and communications company.",
      "It's the occasion for the second-largest holiday meal for retailers behind the feasts that accompany the winter holidays. Compared with an average, Thanksgiving meal shopping delivered a $2.4 billion sales lift during the week before and after the holiday last year, market research firm Circana said. Shopping for Christmas, Hanukah and New Year's Day meals gave stores a $5.3 billion sales uplift compared with an average week, Circana said.",
      "Walmart launched its offer on Oct. 14, two weeks earlier than last year and plans to make it available through Dec. 24. The two bundles the retailer offered last year contained different items, but Walmart said this year\u2019s selected products cost 3.5% less.",
      "Joan Driggs, a Circana vice president, expects shoppers to buy items on sale for half of what they need to prepare Thanksgiving dinner meal. That's double the amount from 2022, when retailers pulled back on promotions due to limited supplies left over from the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Consumers still aren't seeing discounts as deep as the ones grocers trotted out in pre-pandemic 2019, Driggs said. To attract customers, retailers therefore are creating strategies like meal bundles, which may \u201clessen the stress\u201d for shoppers since they show the cost per person, she said.",
      "Angel Rosario-Sanchez, 24, a New Jersey resident who was at a Walmart store in Secaucus on Wednesday, said he planned to have Thanksgiving with his friends but had not shopped for groceries yet. Seeing the big displays of Thanksgiving products in the store made him want to return to buy some.",
      "\"I always count on Walmart for deals,\u201d said Rosario-Sanchez, who usually selects food from Walmart\u2019s lower-end, Great Value brand. \u201cInflation is too much, and it needs to go back to where it originally was.\u201d",
      "For the past two years, Walmart, Target and others have seen price-conscious shoppers shift more of their purchases to store label brands. In response, retailers have improved their selections or created new food lines brands.",
      "Walmart in April launched Bettergoods, its biggest store-label food brand in 20 years in terms of the breadth of items, to appeal to younger customers who aren't loyal to national brands and want chef-inspired foods that are more affordably priced.",
      "But store brands aren't necessarily cheaper.",
      "Wells Fargo\u2019s Agri-Food Institute, a team of national industry advisors that provides economic insights and research, compared the costs of store brands and national name brands for a typical Thanksgiving dinner. The name-brand versions of cranberry sauce were less expensive than the store brands the team inventoried, while the name brand pumpkin pies versus store brand versions were the same price.",
      "Robin Wenzel, the head of the Wells Fargo institute, thinks the makers of some familiar brands realized they \u201covershot\u201d with some of their post-pandemic price increases and are retrenching.",
      "The Agri-Food Institute's 10-person Thanksgiving menu includes turkey, stuffing, salad, cranberries, dinner rolls and pumpkin pie. Using all name-brand would cost $90 this year, 0.5% less than last year. Preparing the same meal with store-branded food would cost $73, or 2.7% more than a year ago.",
      "That gives shoppers the option to mix and match, Wenzel said.",
      "The latest government snapshot on inflation showed grocery prices rose just 0.1% from September to October and are up just 1.1% over the past year. That\u2019s providing some relief to consumers after food costs surged roughly 23% over the past three years.",
      "For main Thanksgiving entr\u00e9es and beverages, prices are easing, but given the spike in food prices in recent years, consumers may or may not feel it.",
      "A 15-item Thanksgiving meal costs an average of $65.51 this year, down nearly 3% from last year but 42% higher overall than in 2019, retail intelligence provider Datasembly said. For example, a 12-ounce can of jellied cranberry sauce averaged $2.89, which is 1% lower than a year ago but still 90% higher compared with 2019.",
      "A 10-pound frozen turkey averages $10.40 this year, a 19% decrease from 2023 but still 6% higher than in 2019, the data firm said. Prices for some Thanksgiving products are still going up: A 30-ounce box of pumpkin pie mix now costs an average of $5.56, up 6% compared with a year ago and nearly 70% more than five years ago, according to Datasembly.",
      "Like many food retailers, Walmart put a mix of store and name-brand products into its Thanksgiving bundle. The meal deal includes Ocean Spray canned jellied cranberry sauce, and green beans and dinner rolls from the in-house Great Value line. The bundle also includes a white whole frozen turkey from the national brand Shady Brook Farms, and fresh items like a 5-pound pound bag of russet potatoes.",
      "Still, plenty will bypass the bundles at Walmart and elsewhere.",
      "While visiting the Walmart in Secaucus, New Jersey, Nadia Rivest, 70, said she already had shopped at the discounter to buy turkey, fish and chicken for her Thanksgiving meal. But she was only interested in buying fresh items, not canned goods.",
      "\u201cI like red pepper, red tomatoes, something fresh,\u201d she said."

      "Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.",
      "The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, but Trump has suggested he wanted to bring it under tighter White House control, in part to use the agency to punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "Carr has of late embraced Trump's ideas about social media and tech. Carr wrote a section devoted to the FCC in \u201c Project 2025,\u201d a sweeping blueprint for gutting the federal workforce and dismantling federal agencies in a second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "Trump has claimed he doesn\u2019t know anything about Project 2025, but many of its themes have aligned with his statements.",
      "Carr said in a statement congratulating Trump on his win that he believed \"the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth.\u201d",
      "\u201cCommissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans\u2019 Freedoms, and held back our Economy,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHe will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America\u2019s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.\u201d",
      "The five-person commission has a 3-2 Democratic majority until next year, when Trump gets to appoint a new member.",
      "Carr has made appearances on Fox News Channel, including when he slammed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris \u2019 appearance on \u201c Saturday Night Live\u201d the weekend before the election -- charging that the network didn\u2019t offer equal time to Trump.",
      "Also a prolific writer of op-eds, Carr wrote in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last month decrying an FCC decision to revoke a federal award for Elon Musk\u2019s satellite service, Starlink. He said the move couldn\u2019t be explained \"by any objective application of the facts, the law or sound policy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn my view, it amounted to nothing more than regulatory lawfare against one of the left\u2019s top targets: Mr. Musk,\u201d Carr wrote."

      "Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva welcomed foreign leaders to Rio de Janeiro\u2019s modern art museum Monday morning and delivered an opening address that focused on fighting food insecurity.",
      "\u201cIt is for those of us here, around this table, to face the undelayable task of ending this stain that shames humanity,\u201d Lula told his colleagues. \u201cThat will be our biggest legacy.\u201d",
      "Heightened global tensions and uncertainty about an incoming Trump administration ahead of the summit already had tempered expectations for a strongly worded statement addressing the conflicts in the Middle East and between Russia and Ukraine. Further dimming prospects of consensus, Argentina\u2019s negotiators challenged some of the draft language.",
      "That has left experts anticipating a final document focused on social issues like the eradication of hunger \u2014 one of Brazil\u2019s priorities.",
      "\u201cLaunching the global alliance (against hunger) was Brazil\u2019s main objective. That was the main point, it was Brazil\u2019s first priority. But other priorities have fallen by the wayside without achieving concrete results, which frustrates Brazil a little,\u201d said Paulo Velasco, an international relations professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. \u201cIt will be difficult to have detailed criticism against Russia or Israel regarding the two wars that could impede consensual support, which is definitely not what Brazil wants.\u201d",
      "After Lulathwarted far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro 's reelection bid in 2022, there was some excitement in the international community at the prospect of the leftist leader and savvy diplomat hosting the G20. Bolsonaro had little interest in international summits, let foreign policy be guided by ideology and clashed with several leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron. Lula took office and often quoted a catchphrase: \u201cBrazil is back.\"",
      "Under Lula, Brazil has reverted to its decades-old principle of nonalignment to carve out a policy that best safeguards its interests in an increasingly multipolar world, even as his administration's foreign policy has at times raised eyebrows.",
      "For the first time ever, Argentina has signed the G20 declaration while dissociating itself from certain aspects, its presidency said in a statement posted to X. Its objections related to limiting freedom of expression on social media; infringement on national sovereignty by institutions of global governance; and greater state intervention to fight hunger, its statement said.",

They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly.",
      "Last month, Argentina alone opposed a declaration of the G20 working group on female empowerment, preventing consensus. While Lula received heads of state Monday with smiles and warm embraces, he and Argentina's right-wing President Javier Milei stood at arms' length while briefly shaking hands. Milei is an avid Trump supporter.",

Looming large on Monday was news of Biden's decision to ease restrictions on Ukraine\u2019s use of longer-range U.S. missiles to allow that country\u2019s military to strike more deeply inside Russia.",
      "During the summit, Biden pointed to his soon-to-end administration\u2019s efforts on global hunger and poverty. He urged counterparts to redouble efforts to ease those ills, as well as to resolve wars in Sudan, Gaza and Ukraine.",
      "\u201cThe United States strongly supports Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Everyone around this table in my view should, as well,\u201d Biden said.",
      "Biden had intended to be part of the G20's group photo, a set piece at most international summits, but it occurred earlier than scheduled, according to a senior administration official, who was not authorized to comment publicly. He missed it, along with Italy\u2019s Giorgia Meloni and Canada's Justin Trudeau, the current and next leaders of the G7 group.",
      "Any commitments Biden makes at the G20 may be overturned by the next White House administration. Trump\u2019s election may also cause some countries to look toward China as a more reliable partner. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with China's Xi Jinping on Monday, the first meeting between British and Chinese leaders since 2018, seeking to repair relations with Beijing.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin is the summit\u2019s most notable absentee. The International Criminal Court has issued a warrant that obliges member states to arrest him. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov attended the meeting.",
      "In a plaza a few blocks away, hundreds of demonstrators gathered to denounce the killings in Gaza, some beating drums and chanting \u201cLong live the fight of the Palestinian people!\u201d Among them were two rabbis who traveled from New York. Israel isn\u2019t a G20 member.",

      "WILMINGTON, Del. -- A federal judge in Delaware on Monday dismissed a lawsuit filed by former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee against social media giant Meta over advertisements using his name and image to sell CBD products.",
      "Huckabee, a Baptist minister and President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to Israel, claimed Meta allowed and profited from the advertisements that falsely claimed he used and endorsed CBD gummies. CBD, or cannabidiol, is one the main active ingredients in marijuana but does not, by itself, provide the high caused by psychoactive THC.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, argued that it was immune from liability under Section 230 of the Federal Communication Decency Act.",
      "U.S. District Judge Gregory Williams rejected that claim. He concluded, however, that Huckabee, a political commentator and two-time presidential candidate, had failed to allege valid claims for invasion of privacy, unjust enrichment and violation of Arkansas\u2019 Publicity Protection Act.",
      "Williams agreed with Huckabee that, in collecting user data and using algorithms to determine which posts and advertisements appeared at the top of users\u2019 newsfeeds, Meta was an \u201cinformation content provider\u201d that was not immune from liability for the illegitimate ads.",
      "The judge nevertheless determined that Huckabee failed to demonstrate that Meta knew the ads were fake, or that it was at least aware of facts and circumstances that would give rise to such knowledge. Huckabee\u2019s assertion that Meta approved and maintained the ads with actual malice or reckless disregard for their truthfulness was merely a \u201cmere conclusory statement,\u201d Williams wrote.",
      "\u201cIt is not reasonable to infer that Meta entertained serious doubts about the asserted advertisements since Governor Huckabee has publicly denounced marijuana,\u201d the judge wrote. \u201cThere is no allegation that Meta was required to conduct \u2018due diligence\u2019 on the truth of the asserted advertisements. Even if there was, such requirement would be insufficient to infer malice.\u201d"

      "A panel of three judges at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard separate oral arguments in the SpaceX and Amazon lawsuits, which the two companies initiated after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers\u2019 rights and union organizing.",
      "A ruling in favor of the companies could immensely diminish \u2013 or paralyze - the nearly century-old agency, which is tasked with enforcing labor laws and settling labor-related complaints workers lodge against their employers. The issue may eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and has issued rulings curbing the power of government agencies,",
      "The three appellate judges who heard Monday's arguments questioned the legal maneuvering by Amazon and SpaceX to get their cases to the 5th Circuit, where jurists nominated by Republican presidents dominate the appeals court.",
      "A lawyer for the NLRB emphasized during the hearing that both companies filed their appeals after lower courts did not give rulings by requested deadlines.",
      "Michael E. Kenneally, an attorney for SpaceX, retorted that the government was \u201crelying so much on the procedural objections\u201d because of the alleged weakness of its legal argument, a claim that elicited some pushback from the panel.",

      "Among other claims, the company argued in its complaint that agency proceedings deprived it of the right to a trial by a jury.",
      "Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, has become more influential in the past few months after pumping an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Donald Trump as president.",
      "After he was elected, Trump tapped Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new efficiency commission focused on cutting costs across the federal government. Musk has said the new administration will have a \u201cmandate to delete the mountain of choking regulations that do not serve the greater good.\u201d",
      "Amazon's lawsuit against the NLRB is tied to the company\u2019s objections to a union election that took place at a warehouse in New York City in April 2022. The retail giant has accused the agency of improperly interfering in that election, partly by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began.",
      "The Amazon Labor Union ultimately won the election to represent workers, but Amazon has refused to come to the negotiating table.",
      "The company\u2019s attorneys argued in the lawsuit that the NLRB board members who authorized the agency\u2019s complaint later \u201cacted as judges\u201d by denying a review of Amazon's objections, which also came before them. Amazon's lawyers maintained the agency\u2019s structure was unconstitutional because board members are shielded from removal by the U.S. president, among other things.",
      "In a statement issued before Monday's hearing, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo said it was \u201cnothing new for big companies to challenge the authority of the NLRB to enforce workers\u2019 rights so as not to be held accountable for their violations\" of labor law."

    "story": [
      "This year\u2019s successful 9-1 football season for Brigham Young University, the Utah private school run by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has an unexpected player at the helm: its first Jewish quarterback",
      "PROVO, Utah -- Shortly after sunset on Saturday, Rabbi Chaim Zippel clasped an overflowing cup of wine and a tin of smelling spices as he marked the end of the Sabbath with a small Jewish congregation at his home near Provo, which doubles as the county\u2019s only synagogue.",
      "The conclusion of the ceremony known as Havdalah set off a mad dash to change into blue and white fan gear and drive to the football stadium at nearby Brigham Young University, the Utah private school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.",
      "Zippel never expected to become a BYU fan, or even a football follower, but that changed when the school where 98.5% of students belong to the faith known widely as the Mormon church added its first Jewish quarterback to the roster.",
      "With Jake Retzlaff at the helm, the Cougars won nine straight games in what was shaping up to be a storied season before a loss Saturday against the Kansas Jayhawks ended their undefeated run. Even so, BYU \u2014 ranked No. 14 in the AP Top 25 \u2014 could end the season at the top of the Big 12 Conference with a chance to make the College Football Playoff.",
      "Retzlaff has earned a hero\u2019s embrace by rabbis and others in Provo's tiny but tight-knit Jewish community while also becoming a favorite of the broader BYU fan base that lovingly calls him the \u201cBYJew.\u201d",
      "One of just three Jewish students in a student body of 35,000, the quarterback and team co-captain who worked his way into the starting lineup has used his newfound stardom to teach others about his own faith while taking steps to learn more about Judaism for himself.",
      "\u201cI came here thinking I might not fit in with the culture, so this will be a place where I can just focus on school and football,\u201d Retzlaff told The Associated Press. \u201cBut I found that, in a way, I do fit. People are curious. And when everybody around you is so faith-oriented, it makes you want to explore your faith more.\u201d",
      "The junior college transfer from Corona, California, formed a fast friendship with the Utah rabbi when he came to BYU in 2023. The two began studying Judaism fundamentals each week in the campus library, which would help Retzlaff speak confidently about his faith in public and in his many required religion classes.",
      "BYU undergraduates must take classes about the Book of Mormon, the gospel of Jesus Christ and the faith's core belief that families can be together forever if marriages are performed in temples. Retzlaff said he was surprised to find many references to the Jewish people in the Book of Mormon. Some classmates and fans have even called him \u201cthe chosen one,\u201d referring to both his success on the field and a Latter-day Saint belief that members of the Jewish faith are God\u2019s chosen people.",
      "\u201cIt's a lot of respect, honestly. They're putting me on a mantel sometimes, and I'm like, \u2018Whoa guys, I don't know about that,'\" he said with a laugh.",
      "Retzlaff, 21, has embraced becoming an ambassador for his faith in college football and in a state where only 0.2% of residents are Jewish. The redshirt junior wears a silver Star of David necklace on campus and attends dinners on Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest, at the rabbi's house during the offseason.",
      "He led Utah County\u2019s first public Hanukkah menorah lighting last year at Provo\u2019s historic courthouse, brought a kosher food truck to a team weight training and wrapped tefillin with Zippel in the BYU stadium. The tefillin ritual performed by Jewish men involves strapping black boxes containing Torah verses to the arm and forehead as a way of connecting to God.",
      "\u201cI told Jake, I said, after doing this here, after connecting to God on your terms inside the stadium, no amount of pressure will ever get to you,\u201d Zippel said. \u201cI think there's no greater example of finding your corner of the world where you're supposed to make your impact and making that impact.\u201d",
      "Retzlaff is affiliated with the Reform denomination of Judaism, which melds Jewish tradition with modern sensibilities, often prioritizing altruistic values and personal choice over a strict interpretation of Jewish law. He plays football on Friday nights and Saturdays during Shabbat and says sports have become a way to connect with his faith and to inspire young Jewish athletes.",
      "Among them is Hunter Smith, a 14-year-old high school quarterback from Chicago who flew to Utah with his dad, brother and a group of Jewish friends to watch Retzlaff play. The brothers sported Retzlaff's No. 12 jerseys, and their father Cameron wore a \u201cBYJew\u201d T-shirt depicting Retzlaff emerging from a Star of David, the most recognizable symbol of the faith.",
      "\u201cBeing the only Jewish quarterback in my area that I know of, I feel like I get to pave my own path in a way,\" Smith said during Saturday\u2019s game. \u201cJake's the only Jewish quarterback in college football, so he\u2019s someone I can relate to and is like a role model for me, someone I can really look up to.\u201d",
      "When Retzlaff lit Provo's giant menorah last December, Zippel said he was touched to hear the quarterback speak about the importance of his visibility at a time when some Jewish students didn't feel safe expressing their religious identity on their own campuses amid heightened antisemitism in the United States.",
      "His presence has been especially impactful for BYU alumna Malka Moya, 30, who had struggled to navigate her intersecting identities on the campus as someone who is both Jewish and a Latter-day Saint.",
      "\u201cJake feels very comfortable wearing his Star of David all the time,\u201d said Moya, who lives near Provo. \u201cI haven\u2019t always been very comfortable with expressing my Jewish identity. But, more recently, I feel like if he can do it, I can do it.\u201d"

      "\"The Josh Allen experience at this magnitude has been phenomenal,\u201d said Bills wide receiver Amari Cooper, who joined the team last month following a trade with Cleveland. \u201cHe\u2019s a great player \u2014 the old adage, big-time players make big-time plays in big-time situations, and that\u2019s exactly what he did.\u201d",
      "It was another performance that strengthens Allen\u2019s MVP case in a season that began without much hype. The Bills were mostly overlooked in the AFC after falling short in the playoffs again last year and losing several key players in the offseason.",

Allen has always played with something to prove ever since he received no scholarship offers coming out of high school, went to junior college and got just one offer to the University of Wyoming.",
      "\u201cThe league has stars and he\u2019s one of them,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cHe\u2019s just a tremendous talent and some guys are just made to play ball. I\u2019ve been having a lot of joy since I\u2019ve been here \u2014 we\u2019ve won every game. It\u2019s been cool.\u201d",

      "That\u2019s why Allen and coach Sean McDermott downplayed the victory.",
      "\u201cIt means we got to nine wins,\u201d Allen said. \u201cI know from outside perception it\u2019s a really big game and what it means for both fan bases and the league, but it\u2019s Week 11.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "There are few sports journalists working today with a resume as broad as Chris Myers, writes AP reviewer Rob Merrill about Myers\u2019 memoir, \u201cThat Deserves a Wow.\u201d",
      "There are few sports journalists working today with a resume as broad as Chris Myers. From a decade doing everything for ESPN (SportsCenter, play by play, and succeeding Roy Firestone as host of the interview show \u201cUp Close\u201d) to decades of involvement with nearly every league under contract with Fox Sports (NFL, NASCAR, Major League Baseball), the kid from Miami has truly seen and done it all when it comes to sports television.",
      "Which is why it\u2019s a little surprising that his memoir, \u201cThat Deserves a Wow,\u201d isn\u2019t more revealing. It hits all the admittedly very high points \u2014 the first live interview with O.J. Simpson following the civil judgement against him in the Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman murders, the 1989 California earthquake that postponed the World Series for a week, and live on-the-scene reporting from the Centennial Park bombing at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 \u2014 but a lot of it is pulled from transcripts and comes across as a rather dry retelling of what fans will recall seeing on TV.",
      "For readers looking to get into the business, though, there\u2019s some good advice in these pages. Myers knew early on what he wanted to do with his life and began writing down his goals. \u201cGet on the radio. Be an anchor on TV,\u201d he scrawled in lipstick on his mirror as a kid. As he grew, he swapped the mirror for note cards and kept them close to his bed, reading them often as reminders. And as he climbed to a top rung on the TV sports ladder, he followed this adage: \u201cIf you don\u2019t jump at unexpected opportunities, you won\u2019t get more than what\u2019s expected.\u201d That\u2019s the tenet that convinced him to leave ESPN for Fox Sports, which was essentially a network start-up in 1998.",
      "That decision led to a slew of opportunities that brought Myers face-to-face with a galaxy of sports stars. He recalls some of his most memorable on-camera moments, from Tom Brady after winning Super Bowls to Mike Tyson in his heyday to the Boise State player who proposed to his cheerleader girlfriend live on Fox. Unlike many TV sportscasters, Myers never got pigeonholed into a sport, which explains how he became the voice of NASCAR as stock car racing surged in popularity.",
      "Being on TV does have its perks, and Myers\u2019 personal friendships with Bill Murray and Charles Barkley fall into that category. Some of the best chapters recount escapades with each of them, one involving a corned beef sandwich and another Barkley\u2019s prodigious gambling habit. There\u2019s also some real heart here, as most fans will probably have forgotten the personal loss Myers experienced in 2012 when his 19-year-old son Christopher died in a car accident.",
      "\u201cBack then I thought, \u2018Well, there\u2019ll be other days.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realize that that was the only day,\u201d is a line spoken by actor Burt Lancaster as Archie \u201cMoonlight\u201d Graham in the movie \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d and Myers uses it to reflect on how it felt (and still feels) to lose a son. The supportive role played by Rick Hendrick, the legendary owner of Hendrick Motorsports, during that tumultuous time in Myers\u2019 life, is a touching revelation.",
      "In the end, it\u2019s easy to forgive Myers for not dishing more or burning any bridges in his memoir. He admits he\u2019s lived his dream and perhaps the ultimate lesson readers should take from the book is that, sometimes, nice guys do finish first.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- As soon as it left his hands, Julius Randle knew his winning 3-pointer was going in.",
      "Randle got the ball with the Minnesota Timberwolves and Phoenix Suns tied at 117 and 2.1 seconds to play. Minnesota, which battled back from 16 points down, advanced the ball down the court with a timeout to set up one final shot on an inbounds play.",
      "With veteran Joe Ingles coming into the game solely to inbound the ball, he found Randle at the top of the key. Randle took two dribbles, shook defender Josh Okogie, stepped back and fired from 3.",
      "The buzzer sounded just after the ball left Randle's hands. When the shot dropped through the net, the Target Center crowd erupted, and Randle's teammates mobbed him on the court.",
      "\"Really the fun part was just seeing how my teammates celebrate,\u201d Randle said. \u201cWe\u2019re a very connected group, and we\u2019re going to celebrate each others\u2019 success. So for me, that was the coolest part.\u201d",
      "Randle's 35 points were the most he's scored since joining the Wolves in a deal that sent Karl-Anthony Towns to the Knicks and also brought Donte DiVincenzo to Minnesota.",
      "Making the moment extra special for Randle was that both of his sons were at the game. While Randle said his older son is at most games, his younger son typically isn't. But he was in the building along with 18,977 other fans to witness his dad's shot.",
      "\u201cI think this is maybe his second game he's come to. He hates them,\u201d Randle said of his 3-year-old son. \u201cFor him to be here and hit the shot in front of him is pretty cool.\u201d",

      "Unbeaten through 15 games after defeating Charlotte 128-114 on Sunday night, Cleveland will try to become just the second team to go 16-0 on Tuesday when it visits the defending champion Celtics, who bounced the Cavs from the playoffs last season.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s great for the NBA, right?\" said Atkinson, the only coach to win his 15 games with a new team. \"Everybody is going to be watching, and I know our guys are anxious. I know they remember last year. We\u2019re going well. They\u2019re going well. It\u2019s great for the league. Great for our franchise. We\u2019re excited.\u201d",
      "Despite resting All-Star guard Donovan Mitchell against the Hornets, the Cavs followed a familiar formula in joining the Golden State Warriors (2015-16), Houston Rockets (1993-94) and Washington Capitols (1948-49) as the only teams to open 15-0.",
      "Darius Garland scored 25 points, Ty Jerome added 24 while starting in Mitchell's spot and the Cavs got a combined 44 points and 26 rebounds from forward Evan Mobley and center Jarrett Allen to hold off the Hornets.",
      "They also extended the longest winning streak in team history and have given Cleveland sports fans something to be excited about in the midst of a football season that crashed long ago for the Browns.",

      "As has been the case in almost every game, the Cavs got positive minutes and moments from everyone Atkinson put on the floor. They also overcame some adversity as both Isaac Okoro and Dean Wade were forced out in the second half with ankle injuries.",
      "Wade, who has made seven starts, left Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in a walking boot. Atkinson doesn't know if Wade or Okoro will be available against the Celtics, but Mitchell should be back after missing his first game \u2014 a planned absence.",

      "Atkinson feels the same way. If the Cavs have title aspirations, this a chance for them to see if they're real.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be a great test for us,\u201d he said. \"They obviously play a different style, five-out with five shooters so it's going to be a real good test for us.

      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Daniel Jones' tenure as the New York Giants starting quarterback is over.",
      "The Giants benched the struggling 27-year-old on Monday and coach Brian Daboll plans to start fan favorite Tommy DeVito against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers this week in an attempt to end a five-game losing streak.",
      "Not only was Jones benched, Daboll said he will be the No. 3 quarterback for the final seven games, while fellow veteran Drew Lock remains the backup.",
      "\u201cObviously not playing the way any of us want to play, and that on all of us,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cBut felt like this was a decision that we needed to make here to try to spark things, change things up and we went with Tommy again.\u201d",
      "Daboll said he spoke with the quarterbacks Monday but he would not disclose what was said although he said Jones wanted to remain the starter. Daboll refused to comment on his talks with co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch.",
      "They will have decisions to make as the Giants (2-8) appear headed for a second straight losing season.",
      "Obviously one will be Jones' future \u2014 he has two years and $80 million left on his contract \u2014 along with that of Daboll and general manager Joe Schoen, who also was hired in 2022.",
      "By not playing Jones the rest of the season, the Giants are trying to avoid an injury. If he were hurt and unable to play at the start of next season, it would trigger a $23 million guarantee on his contract.",
      "Daboll said Jones, who was the No. 6 overall pick in the 2019 draft, will stay with the team the rest of the season.",
      "Derek Carr left the Las Vegas Raiders late last season after he was benched for the final two games.",
      "\u201cWe had a talk right before the meeting today,\u201d Daboll said referring to Jones. \"Never easy. Got a lot of respect for for how he goes about his business, for how Drew does for how he does. Those aren\u2019t easy conversations,\u201d",
      "Daboll had hinted there might be a change after the Giants headed into their bye week following an overtime loss to the Carolina Panthers (3-7) in Germany on Nov. 10. The coaching staff reviewed film during the week, discussed the situation and decided to change things.",
      "Daboll said other players might get more playing time in a late evaluation.",
      "Jones has eight touchdown passes and seven interceptions this season. He is 3-13 in his past 16 starts and New York ranks last in the league in scoring, averaging 15.6 points per game.",
      "Jones got a four-year, $160 million contract after leading the Giants to a surprising playoff appearance in Daboll\u2019s first season in 2022. He saw limited action last season because of a neck injury and later an ACL tear. He played behind a poor offensive line in 2023 and has been inconsistent this season.",
      "Hired after developing Josh Allen in Buffalo, Daboll never could get Jones back to his 2022 form. That season, Jones had 15 touchdown passes, seven rushing TDs, five interceptions and hit 67% of his passes. In his career, Jones has 70 touchdowns and 47 interceptions.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just not on Daniel you know that\u2019s on me, that\u2019s on an entire offensive performance,\u201d Daboll said. \"So again making this decision to try to spark it to give Tommy an opportunity again, he did some nice things when he was in there and he played as a rookie. And I know he\u2019s he\u2019s eager for the opportunity.\u201d",
      "DeVito had been listed as the third quarterback every game this season but jumped ahead of Lock, largely because the New Jersey product nicknamed \u201cTommy Cutlets\" was 3-3 as a rookie free agent starter out of Illinois after Jones and backup Tyrod Taylor were hurt last season.",
      "Daboll said DeVito has had more than 700 snaps in the preseason and as a starter last year. He added he has practiced well this season and has a greater knowledge of the offense in his second season.",
      "\u201cWe'll do everything to get him ready, Daboll said.",

      "NEW YORK -- Doc Rivers was right. It still cost him $25,000.",
      "Rivers, the coach of the Milwaukee Bucks, was fined by the NBA on Sunday, a day after he publicly criticized the officiating that led to the deciding points in a 115-114 loss to the Charlotte Hornets.",

    "story": [
      "A report released Monday by Pew Research Center says about one in five Americans regularly get their news from so-called news influencers on social media",
      "About one in five Americans \u2013 and a virtually identical share of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 regularly get their news from digital influencers who are more likely to be found on the social media platform X, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The findings, drawn from a survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults and an analysis of social media posts posted this summer by influencers, provide an indication of how Americans consumed the news during the height of the U.S. presidential campaign that President-elect Donald Trump ultimately won.",
      "The study examined accounts run by people who post and talk regularly about current events - including through podcasts and newsletters - and have more than 100,000 followers on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X or TikTok. They include people across the political spectrum, such as the progressive podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen and conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro, as well as non-partisan personalities like Chris Cillizza, a former CNN analyst who now runs his own newsletter.",
      "The report found that news influencers posted mostly about politics and the election, followed by social issues like race and abortion and international events, such as the Israel-Hamas war. Most of them \u2013 63% - are men and the majority \u2013 77% - have no affiliation, or background, with a media organization. Pew said about half of the influencers it sampled did not express a clear political orientation. From the ones that did, slightly more of them identified as conservative than as liberal.",
      "During the campaign, both parties and presidential campaigns had courted influencers, including creators who weren't very political, to compete for voters who are increasingly getting most of their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "The Republican and Democratic national conventions had credentialed influencers to cover their events this past summer. Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Alex Cooper for her \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast and talked a little Bay Area basketball with the fellows on \u201cAll the Smoke.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump hung out with the bros on the \u201cBussin\u2019 With the Boys,\u201d \u201cFlagrant\u201d and the popular podcaster Joe Rogan as part of a series of appearances targeting young male voters.",
      "\u201cThese influencers have really reached new levels of attention and prominence this year amid the presidential election,\u201d Galen Stocking, senior computational social scientist at Pew Research Center, said in a statement. \u201cWe thought it was really important to look at who is behind some of the most popular accounts \u2013 the ones that aren\u2019t news organizations, but actual people.\u201d",
      "Even though 85% of news influencers have a presence on X, many of them also have homes on other social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.",
      "Racial minorities, young adults and adults with a lower income were more likely to get their news from news influencers, according to the report. Most of the people surveyed by Pew said news influencers have helped them better understand current events, while roughly a quarter say what they hear has not made much of a difference. A small share \u2014 9% \u2014 say influencers have confused them more.",
      "Media analysts have long been concerned about how influencers - most of whom don't have to abide by editorial standards - could fuel misinformation, or even be used by America's adversaries to churn out content that fits their interests. On social media, though, some influencers have positioned themselves as figures presenting neglected points of view.",
      "Pew, which is doing the study as part of an initiative funded by the Knight Foundation, said 70% of the survey respondents believe the news they get from influencers is somewhat different than what they hear elsewhere. Roughly a quarter said it was \u201cextremely or very different.\u201d",
      "The report found TikTok is the only one of the major platforms where influencers who identify as right-leaning do not outnumber those who are more liberal. Pew said news influencers on the short-form video app were more likely than those on other sites to show support for LGBTQ+ rights or identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The platform also had the smallest gender gap for news influencers.",

    "story": [
      "A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas is being asked to disqualify a winning bid made by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "A company affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a federal judge on Monday to disqualify a bid by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, alleging fraud and collusion.",
      "The company, First United American Companies, which is affiliated with a Jones website that sells dietary supplements, was the only other bidder at the recent auction, offering $3.5 million. In a filing in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, a lawyer for the company asked the judge to declare it the winning bidder instead of The Onion.",
      "The lawyer, Walter Cicack, claimed that the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the auction improperly colluded with The Onion and families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in naming The Onion the winning bidder. Cicack also alleged the trustee violated rules for the sale set by the judge, and said the company's cash offer was twice the amount of The Onion's.",
      "The bankruptcy auction was held last week as part of the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars. Proceeds from the sale will go to Sandy Hook families and other creditors. Jones filed bankruptcy in 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits filed by the families for calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Chicago-based Global Tetrahedron, issued a statement Monday through a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed he\u2019s lashing out by creating conspiracies, but we\u2019re also not surprised,\u201d he said, referring to Jones.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee appointed to oversee the sale, Christopher Murray, declined to comment Monday. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, Christopher Mattei, also declined to comment.",
      "In a response filed in court later Monday, Murray called the allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d He said the motion by First United American to disqualify The Onion was \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Murray also wrote, \u201cHaving failed in its prior efforts to bully the Trustee and his advisors into accepting its inferior bid, FUAC now alleges, without evidence, collusion and bad faith in an attempt to mislead the Court and disqualify its only competition in the auction.\u201d",
      "Murray filed separate court papers Monday asking the judge to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion.",
      "Monday's filing by First United American Companies included the formal bid submitted by The Onion, revealing that it offered $1.75 million for Infowars along with certain incentives by Sandy Hook families who won their defamation lawsuit against Jones. The families agreed to forgo up to 100% of their share of the Infowars sale proceeds and give it to other Jones creditors.",
      "With the families' offer, other Jones creditors would get a total of $100,000 more than they would get if First United American Companies bought Infowars, according to The Onion's bidding document.",
      "Murray told the bankruptcy judge during a court hearing Thursday that the families' incentives made it a better offer than the one by the Jones-affiliated company.",
      "\u201cThe creditors ended up significantly better off,\u201d Murray told the judge, adding that one of his responsibilities was to maximize value for creditors.",
      "Judge Christopher Lopez, who said he had questions about the sale process and concerns about transparency, ordered a hearing to see exactly what happened with the auction and how the trustee chose The Onion. The date of the hearing has not been set.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Collins posted a series of comments about the auction on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\u201cLong and short of it: We won the bid and \u2014 you\u2019re not going to believe it \u2014 the previous InfoWars folks aren\u2019t taking it well,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Collins said last week that The Onion planned to turn the Infowars website into a parody site, taking aim at conspiracy theorists and other social media personalities while promoting gun violence prevention efforts.",
      "Cicack also said in Monday's court filing that the trustee improperly changed the auction process \u201cfrom a live auction to a secret process.\u201d Cicack said that after sealed bids were submitted Nov. 8, it was expected that there would be a round of live bidding on Nov. 13.",
      "But instead, he said, Murray decided to ask the two bidders to submit another offer as their final and best proposal, which they did. Murray then chose from those final bids without holding a round of live bidding. He alleged Murray violated the auction rules.",
      "Lopez's 20-page order on the sale procedures, issued in September, made such a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "Cicack called the Sandy Hook families' portion of The Onion's bid \u201cMonopoly\u201d money with no value.",
      "\u201cIt is also the product of impermissible collusion with the Onion in an effort to \u2018rig\u2019 the auction with the goal of achieving a specific result desired by the Connecticut Families,\u201d he wrote."

      "Authorities say only six monkeys are still on the loose after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Six monkeys were still on the loose early Monday after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research, according to authorities.",
      "Two more Rhesus macaques were trapped Sunday outside the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, bringing the total of recovered monkeys to 37 of the 43 that escaped, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post.",
      "Both monkeys recaptured Sunday were examined and were in \u201cexcellent condition,\u201d said Westergaard, who was present when they were recovered.",
      "\u201cI can attest with absolute certainty that their spirits were high and they showed all the outward signs of being happy well-adjusted monkeys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very pleased that the animals recovered thus far are in such good condition, and that they show no ill effects from their outdoor adventure.\u201d",
      "All the monkeys taken back to the compound have been fed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and monkey biscuits, which are a high protein Purina Monkey Chow that is specially formulated for the rhesus macaques, Westergaard said.",
      "Two other monkeys were spotted near the traps Sunday afternoon and Alpha Genesis planned to begin trapping efforts before dawn Monday and continue through the day.",
      "Forty-three monkeys made a break for it Nov. 6 after an employee at what locals call \u201cthe monkey farm\u201d did not fully lock their enclosure, police said.",
      "There are three gates keeping the monkeys inside their containment area and a worker is supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure allowing the primates to escape, Westergaard told WCSC-TV last week.",
      "Westergaard said it appears the worker made a mistake and did not intentionally leave the gates where the monkeys could escape.",
      "\u201cMy understanding is that immediately after the incident occurred, the employee\u2019s supervisor approached her and stated that she could be terminated if it was determined that there was no structural failure which led to the escape,\u201d Westergaard told the TV station. \u201cI am told at that point the employee walked off the job and has not returned.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis has said efforts to recover all the monkeys will continue for as long as it takes at its compound about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "On Monday, a group called Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent another letter to federal officials asking for fines and further inspection of Alpha Genesis for animal mistreatment.",
      "The letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture said a monkey was found dead with its head stuck in a fence and a second strangled in gauze used to secure water bottles. The letter also details several earlier escapes, including one where a monkey had its arm ripped off and another had its arm broken by a tranquilizer dart.",
      "The incidents involved about 30 monkeys and happened in 2022 or earlier. The letter includes emails and other documents from Alpha Genesis given to the group by someone inside the company, wrote Michael Budkie, the group's executive director.",
      "\u201cThis is not animal care, this is neglect and abuse. Though these violations may be back a couple of years ... there is no reason to assume that such a broad set of violations will be totally remedied,\u201d Budkie wrote.",
      "Alpha Genesis did not return a phone call or email asking about the letter.",
      "The USDA has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020. The facility\u2019s most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues and veterinarians found minor problems in only one of the facility\u2019s past six inspections.",
      "Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe Rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The monkeys pose no risk to public health, Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police have all said. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers.",
      "If people encounter the monkeys, they are advised to stay away from them \u2014 and to not fly drones in the area. The company said they are skittish and might run away from where they are gathered."

      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump on Sunday named Brendan Carr, the senior Republican on the Federal Communications Commission, as the new chairman of the agency tasked with regulating broadcasting, telecommunications and broadband.",
      "Carr is a longtime member of the commission and served previously as the FCC's general counsel. He has been unanimously confirmed by the Senate three times and was nominated by both Trump and President Joe Biden to the commission.",
      "The FCC is an independent agency that is overseen by Congress, but Trump has suggested he wanted to bring it under tighter White House control, in part to use the agency to punish TV networks that cover him in a way he doesn\u2019t like.",
      "Carr has of late embraced Trump's ideas about social media and tech. Carr wrote a section devoted to the FCC in \u201c Project 2025,\u201d a sweeping blueprint for gutting the federal workforce and dismantling federal agencies in a second Trump administration produced by the conservative Heritage Foundation.",
      "Trump has claimed he doesn\u2019t know anything about Project 2025, but many of its themes have aligned with his statements.",
      "Carr said in a statement congratulating Trump on his win that he believed \"the FCC will have an important role to play reining in Big Tech, ensuring that broadcasters operate in the public interest, and unleashing economic growth.\u201d",
      "\u201cCommissioner Carr is a warrior for Free Speech, and has fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans\u2019 Freedoms, and held back our Economy,\u201d Trump said in a statement on Sunday. \u201cHe will end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America\u2019s Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America.\u201d",
      "The five-person commission has a 3-2 Democratic majority until next year, when Trump gets to appoint a new member.",

      "Also a prolific writer of op-eds, Carr wrote in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last month decrying an FCC decision to revoke a federal award for Elon Musk\u2019s satellite service, Starlink. He said the move couldn\u2019t be explained \"by any objective application of the facts, the law or sound policy.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn my view, it amounted to nothing more than regulatory lawfare against one of the left\u2019s top targets: Mr. Musk,\u201d Carr wrote."

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Disgruntled X users are again flocking to Bluesky, a newer social media platform that grew out of the former Twitter before billionaire Elon Musk took it over in 2022. While it remains small compared to established online spaces such as X, it has emerged as an alternative for those looking for a different mood, lighter and friendlier and less influenced by Musk.",
      "Championed by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, Bluesky was an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That invite-only period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other features. The platform resembles Musk\u2019s X, with a \u201cdiscover\u201d feed and a chronological feed for accounts that users follow. Users can send direct messages and pin posts, as well as find \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide a curated list of people and custom feeds to follow.",
      "Bluesky said in mid-November that its total users surged to 15 million, up from roughly 13 million at the end of October, as some X users look for an alternative platform to post their thoughts and talk to others online. The post-election uptick in users isn\u2019t the first time Bluesky has benefited from people leaving X. The platform gained 2.6 million users in the week after X was banned in Brazil in August \u2014 85% of them from Brazil, the company said. About 500,000 new users signed up in one day in October, when X signaled that blocked accounts would be able to see a user\u2019s public posts.",
      "Across the platform, new users \u2014 among them journalists, left-leaning politicians and celebrities \u2014 have posted memes and shared that they were looking forward to using a space free from advertisements and hate speech. Some said it reminded them of the early days of Twitter more than a decade ago.",
      "Despite Bluesky\u2019s growth, X posted after the election that it had \u201cdominated the global conversation on the U.S. election\u201d and had set new records.",
      "Bluesky, though, has bigger ambitions than to supplant X. Beyond the platform itself, it is building a technical foundation \u2014 what it calls \u201ca protocol for public conversation\u201d \u2014 that could make social networks work across different platforms \u2014 also known as interoperability \u2014 like email, blogs or phone numbers.",
      "Currently, you can\u2019t cross between social platforms to leave a comment on someone\u2019s account. Twitter users must stay on Twitter and TikTok users must stay on TikTok if they want to interact with accounts on those services. Big Tech companies have largely built moats around their online properties, which helps serve their advertising-focused business models.",
      "Bluesky is trying to reimagine all of this and working toward interoperability."

    "story": [
      "The refugee organization, the International Rescue Committee, is testing some artificial intelligence tools to try to increase the number of displaced people they can reach with critical information",
      "NEW YORK -- As the International Rescue Committee copes with dramatic increases in displaced people in recent years, the refugee aid organization has looked for efficiencies wherever it can \u2014 including using artificial intelligence.",
      "Since 2015, the IRC has invested in Signpost \u2014 a portfolio of mobile apps and social media channels that answer questions in different languages for people in dangerous situations. The Signpost project, which includes many other organizations, has reached 18 million people so far, but IRC wants to significantly increase its reach by using AI tools \u2014 if they can do so safely.",
      "Conflict, climate emergencies and economic hardship have driven up demand for humanitarian assistance, with more than 117 million people forcibly displaced in 2024, according to the United Nations refugee agency. The turn to artificial intelligence technologies is in part driven by the massive gap between needs and resources.",
      "To meet its goal of reaching half of displaced people within three years, the IRC is testing a network of AI chatbots to see if they can increase the capacity of their humanitarian officers and the local organizations that directly serve people through Signpost. For now, the pilot project operates in El Salvador, Kenya, Greece and Italy and responds in 11 languages. It draws on a combination of large language models from some of the biggest technology companies, including OpenAI, Anthropic and Google.",
      "The chatbot response system also uses customer service software from Zendesk and receives other support from Google and Cisco Systems.",
      "If they decide the tools work, the IRC wants to extend the technical infrastructure to other nonprofit humanitarian organizations at no cost. They hope to create shared technology resources that less technically focused organizations could use without having to negotiate directly with tech companies or manage the risks of deployment.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to really be clear about where the legitimate concerns are but lean into the optimism of the opportunities and not also allow the populations we serve to be left behind in solutions that have the potential to scale in a way that human to human or other technology can\u2019t,\" said Jeannie Annan, International Rescue Committee\u2019s Chief Research and Innovation Officer.",
      "The responses and information that Signpost chatbots deliver are vetted by local organizations to be up to date and sensitive to the precarious circumstances people could be in. An example query that IRC shared is of a woman from El Salvador traveling through Mexico to the United States with her son who is looking for shelter and for services for her child. The bot provides a list of providers in the area where she is.",
      "More complex or sensitive queries are escalated for humans to respond.",
      "The most important potential downside of these tools would be that they don't work. For example, what if the situation on the ground changes and the chatbot doesn\u2019t know? It could provide information that's not just wrong, but dangerous.",
      "A second issue is that these tools can amass a valuable honeypot of data about vulnerable people that hostile actors could target. What if a hacker succeeds in accessing data with personal information or if that data is accidentally shared with an oppressive government?",
      "IRC said it's agreed with the tech providers that none of their AI models will be trained on the data that the IRC, the local organizations or the people they are serving are generating. They've also worked to anonymize the data, including removing personal information and location.",
      "As part of the Signpost.AI project, IRC is also testing tools like a digital automated tutor and maps that can integrate many different types of data to help prepare for and respond to crises.",
      "Cathy Petrozzino, who works for the not-for-profit research and development company MITRE, said AI tools do have high potential, but also high risks. To use these tools responsibly, she said, organizations should ask themselves, does the technology work? Is it fair? Are data and privacy protected?",
      "She also emphasized that organizations need to convene a range of people to help govern and design the initiative \u2014 not just technical experts, but people with deep knowledge of the context, legal experts, and representatives from the groups that will use the tools.",
      "\u201cThere are many good models sitting in the AI graveyard,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause they weren\u2019t worked out in conjunction and collaboration with the user community.\u201d",
      "For any system that has potentially life-changing impacts, Petrozzino said, groups should bring in outside experts to independently assess their methodologies. Designers of AI tools need to consider the other systems it will interact with, she said, and they need to plan to monitor the model over time.",
      "Consulting with displaced people or others that humanitarian organizations serve may increase the time and effort needed to design these tools, but not having their input raises many safety and ethical problems, said Helen McElhinney, executive director of CDAC Network. It can also unlock local knowledge.",
      "People receiving services from humanitarian organizations should be told if an AI model will analyze any information they hand over, she said, even if the intention is to help the organization respond better. That requires meaningful and informed consent, she said. They should also know if an AI model is making life-changing decisions about resource allocation and where accountability for those decisions lies, she said.",
      "Degan Ali, CEO of Adeso, a nonprofit in Somalia and Kenya, has long been an advocate for changing the power dynamics in international development to give more money and control to local organizations. She asked how IRC and others pursuing these technologies would overcome access issues, pointing to the week-long power outages caused by Hurricane Helene in the U.S. Chatbots won't help when there's no device, internet or electricity, she said.",
      "Ali also warned that few local organizations have the capacity to attend big humanitarian conferences where the ethics of AI are debated. Few have staff both senior enough and knowledgeable enough to really engage with these discussions, she said, though they understand the potential power and impact these technologies may have.",
      "\u201cWe must be extraordinarily careful not to replicate power imbalances and biases through technology,\u201d Ali said. \u201cThe most complex questions are always going to require local, contextual and lived experience to answer in a meaningful way.\u201d",

      "A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 has been sentenced to five years in prison",
      "WASHINGTON -- A computer expert who stole bitcoin worth billions of dollars at current prices \u2014 and then spent years laundering some of the hacked cryptocurrency with help from his wife \u2014 was sentenced on Thursday to five years in prison.",
      "Ilya Lichtenstein masterminded one of the largest-ever thefts from a virtual currency exchange before he and his wife, Heather Rhiannon Morgan, carried out an elaborate scheme to liquidate the stolen funds, according to federal prosecutors.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Lichtenstein that his theft was \u201cmeticulously planned\u201d and not an impulsive act.",
      "\u201cIt's important to send a message that you can't commit these crimes with impunity, that there are consequences to them,\u201d she said.",
      "Lichtenstein, who gets credit for the two years and nine months that he has spent in jail since his February 2022 arrest, expressed remorse for \u201cwasting my talents on crime instead of a positive contribution to society.\u201d He said he hopes that he can apply his expertise to fight cybercrime when he gets out of prison.",
      "\u201cI want to take full responsibility for my actions and make amends any way I can,\u201d he said.",
      "The judge is scheduled to sentence Morgan on Monday. Lichtenstein pleaded with the judge to spare his wife from prison, blaming himself for her involvement.",
      "In August 2016, Lichtenstein hacked into a virtual currency exchange, Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, and stole approximately 120,000 bitcoin. It was worth approximately $71 million at the time of the hack and would be valued at more than $7.6 billion at current market prices, according to prosecutors.",
      "Several months later, Lichtenstein began moving the stolen bitcoin in a string of complex transactions designed to conceal its path across a series of accounts and platforms. He enlisted his wife\u2019s help in cleaning the stolen funds.",
      "Lichtenstein, an entrepreneur and cryptocurrency investor, is a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia and grew up in a Chicago suburb. Morgan, a business owner and writer, adopted the alter ego \u201c Razzlekhan \u201d for performing rap songs and recording videos for her music.",
      "Lichtenstein and Morgan were living in New York City when they were arrested in February 2022. They had been living in San Francisco around the time of the hack.",
      "Prosecutors recommended a five-year prison sentence for Lichtenstein, who pleaded guilty in August 2023 to one count of money laundering conspiracy. They recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Morgan, who pleaded guilty to the same charge.",
      "\u201cNeither the hack nor the laundering scheme was an impulsive decision. The defendant (Lichtenstein) spent months attempting to gain access to Bitfinex\u2019s infrastructure and get the accesses and permissions he needed in order to orchestrate his hack,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lichtenstein told his wife about the hack over three years later, but he initially solicited her help in laundering the proceeds \u201cwithout explaining exactly what he was doing,\u201d according to prosecutors.",
      "Morgan \u201cwas certainly a willing participant and bears full responsibility for her actions, but she was a lower-level participant,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "During family trips to Kazakhstan and Ukraine, Lichtenstein met with couriers who delivered him money that he smuggled back into the U.S.",
      "\u201cOver half a decade, the defendant engaged in what IRS agents described as the most complicated money laundering techniques they had seen to date,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "Bitcoin is the largest and oldest cryptocurrency, which is digital money that typically isn\u2019t backed by any government or banking institution. Transactions get recorded with technology called a blockchain.",
      "The couple successfully laundered about 21 percent of the funds stolen from Bitfinex. The laundered money was worth at least $14 million at 2016 prices. Its value would have exceeded $1 billion at the time of their 2022 arrest.",
      "Authorities seized the remaining funds, collectively valued at over $6 billion at current prices.",
      "\u201cHe became one of the greatest money launderers that the government has encountered in the cryptocurrency space,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "An attorney for Bitfinex said the hack \u201cdevastated\u201d its finances and its reputation with its customers, with the stolen funds accounting for approximately 36% of the company's assets at the time of theft.",
      "\u201cBitfinex had to take unprecedented and immediate action to ensure that any losses from the Hack would ultimately be borne by Bitfinex and its shareholders alone, not its customers,\u201d the lawyer, Barry Berke, wrote in a letter to the judge.",
      "A prosecutor said Lichtenstein immediately began cooperating with federal authorities after his arrest, helping them with other cybercrime investigations.",
      "Over 96% of the stolen funds have been recovered, with help from Lichtenstein, according to defense attorney Samson Enzer. The \u201cvast bulk\u201d of the stolen money was never spent, the lawyer said.",
      "\u201cThis is not an evil person,\u201d Enzer said. \u201cThis is a good person who made some very bad mistakes.\u201d",

      "It's auction time for Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "Conspiracy theory purveyor Infowars and most of its assets went on the auction block Wednesday, with Alex Jones waiting to see if he will be allowed to stay or if he will get kicked off its online platforms.",
      "The private auction was being held as part of Jones' personal bankruptcy, which resulted from the nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuit judgments a judge and jurors ordered the bombastic internet show and radio host to pay to families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for repeatedly telling his audience that the Connecticut massacre of 20 children and six adults was a hoax staged by crisis actors. Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the defamation verdicts.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee had said sealed bids would be opened at 10:30 a.m. CST so the winning bidder or bidders could be chosen. But Jones appeared to be getting impatient on his show as hours passed without any word on the results.",
      "\u201cI just want to know: Is this our last day here or not?\" he said.",
      "He later wrote on the social media platform X that the trustees told him the results will be released Thursday morning.",
      "Both Jones' supporters and detractors expressed interest in submitting bids. They included Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and President-elect Donald Trump, and progressive media groups that have been critical of Jones. He said he could be allowed to stay and keep using Infowars' platforms if allies won the bidding but that he could be kicked out and Infowars shut down if opponents bought it.",
      "Jones, based in Austin, Texas, said he set up a new studio, websites and social media accounts just in case. His personal social media in his name \u2014 including his account on X, with more than 3 million followers \u2014 were not up for sale. Court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "Jones revealed Wednesday that he worked with a group that put in a bid, but did not provide any details.",
      "\u201cThe folks I\u2019m working with, who put in (a) substantive bid to try to save Infowars and continue it in the future, have been given no information on the other bidders. That\u2019s all secret,\" he said in a video posted on X.",
      "Everything from Jones\u2019 studio desk to Infowars\u2019 name, video archive, social media accounts, and product trademarks and inventory were up for sale. Buyers could even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. . Any unsold items will be auctioned off next month.",
      "Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets, including real estate as well as guns and other personal belongings, also are being sold as part of the bankruptcy.",
      "Prospective buyers submitted sealed bids and confidentiality agreements by last Friday. The bankruptcy trustee, attorney Christopher Murray, appointed by the Justice Department, could have held new rounds of bidding Wednesday to boost prices above the sealed bids.",
      "Jones said Murray decided to choose from among the sealed bids. Jones said he was frustrated with that decision and learned about changes to the auction process only on Monday. A judge's order in September gave the trustee wide authority and said new bidding rounds on Wednesday were optional.",
      "Murray also could reject bids, even the highest ones, if he deemed them \u201ccontrary to the best interests of the Debtor\u2019s estate, FSS (Infowars parent company Free Speech Systems) and their creditors.\u201d",
      "Families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control. Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 conspiracies and threats by his followers."

    "summary": "Japan&rsquo;s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country&rsquo;s north-central region from starting",
    "story": [
      "Japan\u2019s nuclear watchdog has formally disqualified a reactor in the country\u2019s north-central region from starting",
      "TOKYO -- Japan's nuclear watchdog on Wednesday formally disqualified a reactor in the country's north-central region from restarting, the first rejection under safety standards that were reinforced after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. The decision is a setback for Japan as it seeks to accelerate reactor restarts to maximize nuclear power.",
      "The Nuclear Regulation Authority said the Tsuruga No. 2 reactor is \u201cunfit\u201d as its operator failed to address safety risks stemming from the presence of possible active fault lines, which can potentially cause earthquakes, underneath it.",
      "Tsuruga No. 2, operated by the Japan Atomic Power Co., is the first reactor to be rejected under safety standards adopted in 2013 based on lessons from the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi meltdown disaster following a massive earthquake and tsunami.",
      "\u201cWe reached our conclusion based on a very strict examination,\u201d NRA chairperson Shinsuke Yamanaka told reporters.",
      "The verdict comes after more than eight years of safety reviews that were repeatedly disrupted by data coverups and mistakes by the operator, Yamanaka said. He called the case \u201cabnormal\u201d and urged the utility to take the result seriously.",
      "The decision is a blow to Japan Atomic Power because it virtually ends its hopes for a restart. The operator, which is decommissioning its other reactor, Tsuruga No. 1, had hoped to put No. 2 back online, but it would require an examination of dozens of faults around the reactor to prove their safety.",
      "\u201cThe decision is extremely regrettable,\" Japan Atomic Power said in a statement. It said it will continue efforts to restart.",
      "An NRA safety panel concluded three months ago it could not rule out the possibility of active fault lines about 300 meters (330 yards) north of the No. 2 reactor stretching to right underneath the facility, meaning the reactor cannot be operated.",
      "Japan\u2019s government in 2022 adopted a plan to maximize the use of nuclear energy, pushing to accelerate reactor restarts to secure a stable energy supply and meet its pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that safety is the prerequisite for nuclear plant operation and that the government respects the scientific and highly technical decision by the watchdog. He said the government's position to promote nuclear energy is unchanged.",
      "Concern about the government\u2019s revived push for nuclear energy grew after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit Japan\u2019s Noto Peninsula on Jan. 1, 2024, killing more than 400 people and damaging more than 100,000 structures. The quake caused minor damage to two nearby nuclear facilities, and evacuation plans for the region were found to be inadequate.",
      "Building key nuclear facilities, such as reactors, directly above active fault lines is prohibited in earthquake-prone Japan.",
      "Yamanaka said the NRA is not immediately ordering a decommissioning because the reactor, which is offline and its spent fuel safely cooled, will not pose a major threat.",
      "If the utility decides to reapply, it must address not only the faults issue but it also must implement adequate safety measures for the entire plant, Yamanaka said. Providing scientific proof of the status of faults underneath key nuclear facilities is difficult, but other operators that obtained restart permits all cleared the requirement, he noted.",
      "The Tsuruga No. 2 reactor first started commercial operation in February 1987 and has been offline since May 2011. The operator rejected the NRA panel's 2013 on-site inspection results, which concluded that the faults under the No. 2 reactor were active, and applied for a restart in 2015.",
      "Of more than 50 commercial reactors, 27 have applied for restarts and 17 of them have been approved so far under the post-Fukushima safety standard."

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A tech consultant charged with murder in Cash App founder Bob Lee\u2019s stabbing death sparred with the lead prosecutor at trial Thursday, interrupting questions asked of him with his own questions as he was grilled on his testimony.",
      "Nima Momeni, 40, had to be told several times by the judge to provide responsive answers.",
      "He broke his public silence after 18 months when he took the witness stand Wednesday to explain how Lee was found staggering on a deserted downtown San Francisco street at 2:30 a.m. on April 4, 2023, dripping a trail of blood and calling for help. He later died at a hospital.",
      "Momeni testified Lee, 43, suddenly pulled a knife on him after he cracked a \u201cbad joke\u201d suggesting Lee should spend his last night in the city with family instead of trying to visit a strip club. He said Lee later walked away, showing no signs he was injured.",
      "His testimony stunned Lee's father, brother and ex-wife, who have been a steadfast presence in the criminal trial. They say Lee was big-hearted and gentle, and close to his two children and ex-wife.",
      "\u201cWhat you have seen is Nima be aggressive on the stand, you\u2019ve seen him just trying to take control of this room, his arrogance and his entitlement are on full display here,\u201d said the victim's brother, Timothy Oliver Lee, speaking with reporters outside the court room Thursday.",
      "\u201cThis is insane,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of this is ridiculous.\u201d",
      "The trial is in its fifth week. Momeni faces 26 years to life if convicted.",
      "Lee\u2019s death stunned the tech community as fellow executives and engineers penned tributes to the charismatic entrepreneur\u2019s generosity and brilliance. He was chief product officer of cryptocurrency platform MobileCoin when he died.",
      "Prosecutors say Momeni planned the April 4 attack after a dispute over his younger sister, Khazar Momeni, with whom Lee was friends. Momeni had picked up his sister from the home of a drug dealer introduced to her by Lee, and she said she may have been sexually assaulted after ingesting a date-rape drug called GHB.",
      "They say Momeni was angry with Lee so he took a knife from his sister\u2019s condo, and after the pair was kicked out of her place at 2 a.m., he drove Lee to a secluded area and stabbed him three times and then fled.",
      "Omid Talai, the assistant district attorney, grilled Momeni on Thursday on details of exactly how the attack unfolded. He asked Momeni why he did not call police after the attack and learning Lee had died, and why he did not respond to his sister's text asking where he had dropped off Lee.",
      "Momeni said he did not learn of Lee\u2019s death until the following day and was puzzled by his sister\u2019s query. He said he thought Lee could have been stabbed by someone else shortly after he saw him walk off, unharmed.",
      "In response to questions, Momeni said he didn't know what the prosecutor was getting at, accused him of misrepresenting his statements and said he had already answered.",
      "At one point, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Alexandra Gordon said that the prosecutor had no obligation to provide him with a printout of the texts he was questioning him about or to put them on the multimedia screen.",
      "\u201cGotcha,\u201d said Momeni, dressed in a blue suit and tie. \u201cThank you for clarifying.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors have video showing Lee and Momeni leaving Khazar Momeni's condo after 2 a.m. and driving off together in Momeni\u2019s BMW. Video also shows the two men getting out of the car in an isolated spot by the Bay Bridge.",
      "Prosecutors say that is where Momeni stabbed Lee, while the defense says that is where Lee attacked Momeni, erratic and aggressive from a multi-day bender of cocaine, ketamine and drinking.",
      "A knife recovered from the area where Lee was stabbed showed Momeni's DNA on the handle, but the defense said the handle should have been tested for fingerprints, namely Lee\u2019s.",
      "Momeni said he and Lee were on friendly terms when they left his sister's condo, but prosecutors say the defendant grilled the entrepreneur earlier in the evening about what might have happened to his sister at the drug dealer's apartment.",
      "The prosecutor pointed out multiple times Thursday that Momeni was questioning him the way he grilled Lee.",
      "Nima Momeni was 14 when his mother, Mahnaz Tayarani, took him and Khazar to the U.S., fleeing Iran and a husband who had inflicted years of abuse and violence on the family, she wrote in a letter submitted to the court in support of her son\u2019s pre-trial release.",
      "She has sat on one side of the courtroom while Lee's family members sit on the other."

      "BAKU, Azerbaijan -- For the third straight year, efforts to fight climate change haven't lowered projections for how hot the world is likely to get \u2014 even as countries gather for another round of talks to curb warming, according to an analysis Thursday.",
      "At the United Nations climate talks, hosted in Baku, Azerbaijan, nations are trying to set new targets to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases and figure out how much rich nations will pay to help the world with that task.",
      "But Earth remains on a path to be 2.7 degrees Celsius (4.9 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than pre-industrial times, according to Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists and analysts who study government policies and translate that into projections of warming.",
      "If emissions are still rising and temperature projections are no longer dropping, people should wonder if the United Nations climate negotiations \u2014 known as COP \u2014 are doing any good, said Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s an awful lot going on that\u2019s positive here, but on the big picture of actually getting stuff done to reduce emissions ... to me it feels broken,\u201d Hare said.",
      "The world has already warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times. That's near the 1.5-degree (2.7 F) limit that countries agreed to at 2015 climate talks in Paris. Climate scientists say the atmospheric warming, mainly from human burning of fossil fuels, is causing ever more extreme and damaging weather including droughts, flooding and dangerous heat.",
      "Climate Action Tracker does projections under several different scenarios, and in some cases, those are going up slightly.",
      "\u201cThis is driven highly by China,\u201d said Sofia Gonzales-Zuniga of Climate Analytics. Even though China's fast-rising emissions are starting to plateau, they are peaking higher than anticipated, she said.",
      "Another upcoming factor not yet in the calculations is the U.S. elections. A Trump administration that rolls back the climate policies in the Inflation Reduction Act, and carries out the conservative blueprint Project 2025, would add 0.04 degree Celsius (0.07 Fahrenheit) to warming projections, Gonzales-Zuniga said. That's not much, but it could be more if other nations use it as an excuse to do less, she said.",
      "\u201cFossil fuels and emissions are not peaking,\u201d said Sherry Rehman, chair of climate and environment committee in Pakistan\u2019s senate. After 29 years of climate talks, Rehman said countries are \u201cstill talking in bumper stickers.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe need a transformative solution. We need strong delivery,\u201d Rehman said.",
      "The major battle in Baku is over how much rich nations will pay for developing countries to decarbonize their energy systems, cope with future harms of climate change and pay for damage from warming's extreme weather.",
      "A special independent group of experts commissioned by United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres issued its own estimate of costs and finances on Thursday, calling for a tripling of the old commitment. It said about $1 trillion a year is needed by developing nations from all outside sources, not just government grants.",
      "\u201cAdvanced economies need to demonstrate a credible commitment\u201d to helping poor nations, the report said.",
      "Negotiations on a grand total and structuring the overall amount have taken \u201ca step back\u201d when a draft of just a few pages that was worked on for a year was rejected and the latest proposal with many options has more than 30 pages, said top European negotiator Veronika Bagi of Hungary. European Commission negotiator Jacob Werksman said there\u2019s a \u201cvery significant gap\u2033 between what rich and poor nations propose.",
      "German climate envoy Jennifer Morgan said \u201cprivate investment has to be brought to the table\u201d in order to fulfill developing countries needs. But Mariana Paoli of Christian Aid said any number that comes out of negotiations that's not based in publicly-financed grants \u201cwill be meaningless.\u201d",
      "Relying on the private sector means climate cash will not be \u201cneeds based, it will be profit-driven,\" she said, adding that crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and bank bailouts proves that public funds are available.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s about fairness, it\u2019s about justice,\u201d she said.",
      "Getting climate cash is personal for many activists from vulnerable nations, like Sandra Leticia Guzman Luna, who is from Mexico and the director of the climate finance group for Latin America and the Caribbean. \u201cWe are observing the climate impacts causing a lot of costs, not only economic costs but also human losses,\u201d she said.",

      "In April shareholders rebuffed efforts by activist investor Nelson Peltz to claim seats on the company board, standing firmly behind Iger as he tries to energize the company after a rough stretch.",

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia plans to require social media platforms to act to prevent online harms to users such as bullying, predatory behavior and algorithms pushing destructive content, the government said Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe Digital Duty of Care will place the onus on digital platforms to proactively keep Australians safe and better prevent online harms,\u201d Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said in a statement.",
      "The proposed changes to the Online Safety Act were announced before the government next week introduces to Parliament world-first legislation that would ban children younger than 16 from platforms including X, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok.",
      "Critics have argued that removing children from social media reduced incentives for platforms to provide safer online environments.",
      "Social media has been blamed for an increase in children taking their own lives and developing eating disorders due to bulling and exposures to negative body images.",
      "Rowland said making tech companies legally responsible for keeping Australians safe was an approach already adopted by Britain and the European Union.",
      "Digital businesses would be required to take reasonable steps to prevent foreseeable harms on their platforms and services. The duty of care framework would be underpinned by risk assessment and risk mitigation, and informed by safety-by-design principles, the minister said.",
      "Legislating a duty of care would mean services can\u2019t \u201cset and forget.\u201d Instead, their obligations would mean they need to continually identify and mitigate potential risks, as technology and service offerings change and evolve, she said.",
      "The categories of harm in the legislation include harm to young people and mental well-being, promotion of harmful practices and illegal activity.",
      "The government has not said when the duty of care legislation will be introduced to Parliament or outlined the punishment for breaches.",

      "Swinburne University digital media expert Belinda Barnet described the duty of care as a \u201cgreat idea.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite pioneering to expect that platforms that host Australian users would have a duty of care responsibility in terms of the content they show and the experiences they offer,\u201d Barnet said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s making the platforms take responsibility and that just simply doesn\u2019t happen at the moment. There\u2019s an assumption that they\u2019re a neutral third party. They\u2019re not responsible for the impact of that content,\u201d Barnet added.",

Previous studies, including data from NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, suggested the far side might also have a volcanic past.

The reality is this ban, if implemented, is just kicking the can down the road for when a young person goes on social media,\u201d Leo added.",

    "title": "'Shock and awe': What Trump's 'border czar' has said he plans to do starting on Day 1",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 18:57:50 -0500",
    "summary": "Based on media appearances and public forums, here's what former acting ICE director Tom Homan has said he will do starting Day 1 as the nation's new \"border czar.\"",
    "story": [
      "Homan has been tapped to oversee mass deportations in the new administration.",
      "Last week, while appearing on Donald Trump Jr.'s podcast, the president-elect's son asked incoming \"border czar\" Tom Homan what border and immigration-related action the public can expect to see on Day 1 of the new Trump administration.",
      "\"Shock and awe,\" Homan responded. \"Shock and awe,\" he repeated with a smile.",
      "Homan, who served as the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first Trump administration, has suggested he's been waiting more than two years for this moment.",
      "At a public event last year, he recounted how, over dinner in Las Vegas in the middle of 2022 -- several months before former President Donald Trump announced his reelection bid -- Trump confided in Homan that he was going to run for the White House again and asked if he could count on Homan to return with him.",
      "As Homan recalled, he told Trump, \"I'll tell you what, sir, I'm so pissed off I'll come back for free.\"",
      "In the two years since then, Homan has used media appearances, public forums and even a nonprofit charity he launched to make his case for a return to Trump's aggressive approach to border security and immigration enforcement, often wielding personal stories, government statistics and merciless rhetoric to warn that violent criminals, potential terrorists and other major threats are streaming across the border.",
      "According to Homan, current immigration policies are \"national suicide,\" President Joe Biden is \"treasonous,\" and \"something is coming.\" Homan's critics have called his views \"cruel\" and \"cold.\"",
      "As Homan sees it, he's simply passionate about border security because of everything he's experienced in his nearly four decades as a Border Patrol agent and top-level ICE official.",
      "\"I'm excited. We're already working on these plans,\" he said on Trump Jr.'s podcast last week.",
      "But what has Homan said the new Trump administration's border efforts and immigration policy will actually entail?",
      "Here's a comprehensive look at what Homan's public statements have indicated about his possible plans, and why -- despite his detractors -- he insists it's the right approach.",
      "Though numbers started to slow this past year, under the Biden administration, key border-related numbers surged to record levels, with nearly 9 million migrant encounters along the southwest border since Biden took office, more than 2 million more border-crossers reportedly detected but never captured, and more than 300 migrants stopped at the border with names matching known or suspected terrorists on a government watchlist.",
      "While Homan has promised to execute \"the biggest deportation operation this country has ever seen,\" he has also acknowledged the breadth of that operation largely depends on how much money Congress provides for it.",
      "With Republicans about to control both the House and Senate, the new Trump administration could have significant flexibility to conduct its operation. But \"it all depends on the resources we're given,\" especially because a bigger operation needs more officers and more detention beds for those being deported, Homan has said.",
      "\"Congress is going to have to give a massive amount of detention beds,\" he said.",
      "ICE's current funding allows for less than 50,000 beds -- and though ICE has long relied on privately-run detention facilities to help house migrants, that multimillion-dollar business could grow under Trump's expected enforcement expansion.",
      "Homan has said ICE may have to detain some migrants for as long as several weeks.",
      "\"What people don't understand is we can't just put [them on] a plane,\" he said. \"There's a process we have to go through. You have to contact the country, they have to agree to accept them, then they got to send you travel documents. And that takes several days to several weeks. So we need detention assets.\"",
      "To boost ICE's ranks, Homan has suggested the administration could move officers from other agencies to assist. And in recent days, Trump has indicated he will seek help from the U.S. military by declaring a national emergency, though Trump did not offer any details. In the past, members of the National Guard have been deployed to the border to help with surveillance or administrative tasks -- not to make arrests.",
      "\"The bottom line is: Can Tom Homan remove 10 million people in a year? No. I'm not going to lie to you,\" Homan said on a podcast last year. \"But we're going to be out there looking for them [and] when we find them, remove them.\"",
      "Homan has promised a \"targeted\" approach, at first prioritizing known or suspected national security threats, migrants with criminal histories who are already detained by local law enforcement, and \"fugitives\" who were already ordered removed by a federal judge.",
      "Appearing on Fox News on Monday, Homan said he's traveling to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate later this week \"to put the final touches on the plan.\u201d",
      "Homan has previously vowed whatever they ultimately do will be \"humane.\"",
      "\"We can do this right ... because we can't lose the faith of the American people,\" he said.",
      "Homan has also said that the Trump administration must finish building the wall along the southwest border and must pressure so-called \"sanctuary cities\" to help flag criminal migrants in their custody.",
      "Homan has strongly disputed claims that he created the highly controversial policy that separated thousands of children from their parents during the first Trump administration, when he was acting ICE director.",
      "However, he has publicly expressed support for it, telling CBS News in the run-up to the election that child separation \"needs to be considered, absolutely.\"",
      "In April 2018, when the first Trump administration was still developing its \"zero tolerance\" approach to illegal immigration, Homan and two counterparts in other agencies signed a memo recommending that, among other potential measures, the Trump administration should seriously consider prosecuting \"all amenable adults\" crossing the border illegally, including parents crossing with their families.",
      "\"[It] would likely have the most effective impact,\" the memo said.",
      "The next month, when then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions held a press conference in San Diego to publicly declare that parents who unlawfully brought their children across the border would be prosecuted and separated from their children, Homan told reporters that his department \"stands shoulder to shoulder\" with Sessions.",
      "However, at the same press conference, Homan disputed that the Trump administration had \"created new policy.\"",
      "\"This has always been the policy,\" he said. \"Every law enforcement agency in this country separates parents from their children when they're arrested for a crime. ... That child can't go into a U.S. [jail].\"",
      "\"The policy remains the same, there's just going to be more of what we've been doing,\" he said.",
      "A subsequent report from the Justice Department's inspector general concluded that Sessions \"was a driving force in the DHS decision to begin referring family unit adults for prosecution,\" and that what he pushed created a change in \"DHS practice\" dating back to at least 1992.",
      "Over just two months in 2018, more than 3,000 children were separated from their families, \"and issues regarding reuniting children with a parent remain,\" said the report, issued in January 2021, nearly three years after the \"zero tolerance\" policy was implemented.",
      "The policy sparked an international uproar, with some of its most ardent critics saying it amounted to \"torture carried out in the name of the American people.\" Media reports captured the trauma suffered by children who were taken from their parents. Under such pressure, then-President Trump ultimately reversed the policy.",
      "In his 2020 memoir, Homan wrote that despite \"the screaming\" over the Trump administration's approach, \"during the few weeks the zero-tolerance policy was actually enforced, illegal crossings at the Rio Grande Valley went down over 20 percent.\"",
      "\"How many women were saved from exploitation? How many kids were not abused or killed by coyotes? How many bad guys did we prevent from entering our communities? We'll never know the exact number, but we made a difference,\" Homan wrote.",
      "Pressed by CBS News last month about whether family separations will happen under Trump's next administration, Homan said one way to avoid them is to deport children and their parents -- \"Families can be deported together,\" he said.",
      "By the time Trump took office in 2017, the government's limited capacity to detain migrants made it common practice for U.S. authorities to release nonviolent border-crossers claiming asylum into the United States while they waited for their cases to be heard by a judge -- a practice that has become known as \"catch and release.\"",
      "But a backlog of cases, driven by a shortage of immigration court judges, has meant that after being released, asylum cases can take years to resolve, with no guarantee that migrants will actually show up in court or leave voluntarily if they lose their cases.",
      "While the first Trump administration took steps to limit \"catch and release,\" the practice has expanded under the Biden administration as it's faced an unprecedented influx of migrants.",
      "\"End catch and release, that needs to happen Day One,\" Homan said last week of Trump's second term. \"Because if you end 'catch and release,' they'll stop coming.\"",
      "To illustrate how migrants are exploiting the practice, Homan has often pointed to government data showing that, as he puts it, \"nearly nine out of ten never get relief from the U.S. courts because they don't qualify\" for asylum. He has said those nine out of 10 asylum-seekers are \"committing fraud.\"",
      "But the statistics are complicated: Instead of showing that nine out of 10 asylum claims in court are denied, they show that a significant portion of asylum claims are never formally filed with an application, are abandoned, or are derailed in court for other unclear reasons. Under the Biden administration, more asylum claims have actually been granted in court than explicitly denied.",
      "Nevertheless, Homan has long said that anyone with a legitimate claim of asylum shouldn't try to enter the country through a desert or across a river -- they should go to an official port of entry.",
      "\"If you have a clear claim to asylum, go to the port of entry where you're safe,\" he said at the May 2018 press conference in San Diego. \"This isn't just about law enforcement, this is about saving lives.\"",
      "According to Homan, part of ending \"catch and release\" is reinstating the \"Remain in Mexico\" program launched under the first Trump administration, which blocked asylum seekers on the southwest border from entering the United States while their asylum cases were pending.",
      "On Trump Jr.'s podcast last week, Homan said he believes that pushed migrants to stop coming, \"and so the 'Remain in Mexico' program has to be put back in place.\"",
      "In a campaign video last year, Trump said that \"on Day 1 of my new term in office,\" he will end the court-backed tradition of birthright citizenship, which for centuries has automatically bestowed U.S. citizenship to anyone born inside the United States, regardless of their parents' status.",
      "Trump suggested the practice stems from \"a historical myth and a willful misinterpretation\" of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which states that, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\"",
      "\"As part of my plan to secure the border,\" Trump said in the campaign video, \"I will sign an executive order making clear to federal agencies that under the correct interpretation of the law, going forward the future children of illegal aliens will not receive automatic U.S. citizenship.\"",
      "\"My policy will choke off a major incentive for continued illegal immigration,\" he added.",
      "Homan has echoed that sentiment, saying on a podcast last year, \"One thing that we're going to have this president do ... [is] end birthright citizenship.\"",
      "Both Homan and Trump have said ending birthright citizenship will also put an end to so-called \"birth tourism,\" when pregnant women from overseas travel to the United States so they can give birth on U.S. soil and ensure their new child is granted U.S. citizenship.",
      "In his campaign video, Trump said his Day 1 executive order will end that \"unfair practice\" and, according to him, its abuse by parents who then \"jump the line and get green cards for themselves and their family members\" -- part of a practice known as \"chain migration.\"",
      "In his 2020 book, entitled \"Defend the Border and Save Lives,\" Homan said \"chain migration\" leads to an \"uncontrollable increase in legal immigration.\" But he supported \"chain migration\" for spouses and children, writing, \"The family household is the building block of our society, and we must support policies that keep this unit intact.\"",
      "In last year's campaign video, Trump said his executive order will stipulate that at least one parent of a U.S. citizen child will have to be a citizen or legal permanent resident themselves in order for the rest of the family to qualify for immigration benefits.",
      "Part of Homan's approach is to discourage employers from hiring undocumented immigrants in the first place.",
      "During a recent appearance on Fox News, he said \"worksite operations have to happen,\" particularly because -- according to him -- so many undocumented immigrants found at targeted worksites were either sex-trafficked or forced into labor.",
      "But he has also said that employers should be legally required to use E-Verify, an online U.S. government system that enables employers to confirm the employment eligibility of their employees.",
      "All federal contractors and vendors are required to use it, and several states require every employer within the state to use it -- but across the country E-Verify is still a largely voluntary program.",
      "As Homan describes it, broader usage of the system would help diminish a significant driver of illegal migration by making it harder for undocumented immigrants to find work. \"We got to establish E-Verify so they can't get a job as easy,\" he said on a podcast last year.",
      "Homan has recognized that critical parts of the U.S. economy like farming, construction and meatpacking often rely on undocumented workers -- \"but that's a stupid reason not to enforce our laws,\" he wrote in his 2020 book.",
      "Nevertheless, Homan has said that the U.S. government -- while still enforcing immigration laws -- should also expand current programs or establish new ones that would allow more immigrants to work inside the country temporarily",
      "\"If there are jobs up here that we need these people for, then create a program, and bring them in legally,\" he told WWNY-TV in Watertown, New York, last week. \"That way they're not paying the criminal cartels, they're not swimming across the river. \u2026 I much prefer that than people entering illegally, because it's a dangerous thing to do.\"",
      "As Homan makes plans to get to work on Day 1 of a new Trump administration, several sources familiar with the matter have told ABC News that executive orders will be a substantial part of the approach.",
      "\"If you want to secure the border, do it with the stroke of a pen, just like President Trump did,\" Homan said on a podcast earlier this year, referring to executive actions taken in Trump's first term.",
      "At least some of the measures Homan has advocated could be advanced through executive orders.",
      "On a podcast in February, Homan said he's also \"going to push\" for either an executive order or new legislation that \"clearly\" bans someone who disobeys a judge's deportation order from ever receiving any form of future legal immigration status.",
      "\"If after due process you've been ordered removed by a federal judge, and you don't leave, you will never qualify for another immigration benefit the rest of your life,\" Homan said -- adding that the proposal could even ban them from getting a tourist visa.",
      "\"If that was actually in effect, a lot of people would leave on their own because many of them have U.S. citizen children,\" and they don't want to rule out being able to return to the United States someday, the former ICE official said.",
      "\"Big things are coming in the weeks ahead,\" Homan wrote on X this past week.",

      "It's now clear why.",
      "His Cabinet picks of Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary and former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence raised eyebrows and alarms. But his selection of now former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general prompted audible gasps from House Republicans huddled behind closed doors and later public bewilderment from some GOP senators.",
      "ABC News Chief Washington Correspondent Jonathan Karl reports Trump will move full steam ahead, seeing the nominations as a critical test of loyalty for the new Republican leadership on Capitol Hill.",
      "If that loyalty fails, Karl reports, Trump's team is eyeing a nuclear option to bypass Congress altogether: having lawmakers adjourn, or forcing them to adjourn, so he could install his picks without the \"advise and consent\" confirmation process in the Senate -- a key legislative power also called for in the Constitution.",
      "It would be a maneuver in line with Trump's push for more unchecked executive power in his second term, something Karl calls part of his \"dictator on Day 1\" strategy.",
      "\"This kind of contrivance, I think, would be unprecedented,\" said Harry Litman, a former U.S. attorney and deputy assistant attorney general who teaches constitutional law.",
      "Experts who spoke with ABC News could not recall a time when the Senate and House agreed to recess solely for the purpose of allowing a president to place controversial figures in powerful government positions.",

      "Should a nominee face seemingly insurmountable headwinds, Trump could ask both chambers to recess in order to make the appointments himself. But what happens if the House and Senate don't see eye to eye on a recess?",
      "Article II Section 3 of the Constitution provides for a president to adjourn Congress should there be a \"case of disagreement.\"",
      "The provision reads, in part: \"On extraordinary Occasions ... in Case of Disagreement ... with respect to the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall think proper.\"",
      "That's never been done before, said Josh Chafetz, a constitutional law professor at Georgetown University.",
      "If Trump were to go that route, it would likely face legal challenges and potentially wind up before the Supreme Court.",
      "In 2014, the Supreme Court weighed in on the issue of recess appointments after then-President Barack Obama used a short break in congressional business to place officials on the National Labor Relations Board.",
      "The decision in NLRB v. Noel Canning ultimately gave the president power to fill vacancies in recesses greater than 10 days.",
      "But Justice Anton Scalia, in a concurring opinion, argued against the broad guidelines the justices set.",
      "\"The Court's decision transforms the recess-appointment power from a tool carefully designed to fill a narrow and specific need into a weapon to be wielded by future Presidents against future Senates,\" Scalia wrote.",
      "Joining his concurrence were three conservative justices who still sit on the bench: Chief Justice John Roberts, Justice Samuel Alito and Justice Clarence Thomas.",
      "\"For any untried stratagem of the sort Trump may be contemplating, there will be an uncertain outcome in the Supreme Court,\" Litman said.",
      "But Chafetz noted that the current Supreme Court has taken a broad view of presidential authority, like earlier this year in its immunity ruling.",
      "\"This Supreme Court is one that is very invested in executive power,\" Chafetz said. \"It's also a Supreme Court that has been very friendly to Trump generally, and so I would be surprised if they stepped in to block recess appointments under those circumstances.\"",
      "Recess appointments have been used by past presidents to fill administration roles, including more than 100 times by Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. Bush and Obama made recess appointments at the \"deputy\" level but not for Cabinet posts.",
      "No recess appointments were made by the previous Trump administration or the Biden administration.",
      "During his first term, Trump floated the idea as he expressed frustration with Senate Democrats opposing some of his nominees, but he never carried it out.",
      "This time, he would be trying to do so while Republicans have a trifecta: control of the White House, the Senate and the House.",
      "\"That's his own party revolting and balking,\" Litman said, \"and if he's somehow able to bypass that, that's an even greater amassing of power on his part.\"",
      "Chafetz called it a \"dominance play\" from Trump.",
      "\"He wants to show that he can make the Senate abase itself, right?\" he said. \"He wants the entire Republican conference in the Senate to do this thing that's a show of fealty to him that involves not just the act of confirming his nominees, but actually adjourning itself so as to give up its power and let him do this unilaterally.\"",

      "\u201cThis will directly impact people\u2019s pocketbooks,\u201d one expert said.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has promised a major escalation of the nation\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Trump has proposed tariffs of between 60% and 100% on Chinese goods, and a tax of between 10% and 20% on every product imported from all U.S. trading partners.",
      "Economists widely forecast that tariffs of this magnitude would increase prices paid by U.S. shoppers, since importers typically pass along a share of the cost of those higher taxes to consumers.",
      "Trump's tariffs would cost the average U.S. household about $2,600 per year, according to an estimate from the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Some products would likely undergo much more significant price increases than others, experts told ABC News, pointing to items like electronics and toys that rely heavily on imports.",
      "\u201cThis will directly impact people\u2019s pocketbooks,\u201d Rob Handfield, a professor of operations and supply-chain management at North Carolina State University, told ABC News.",
      "In response to ABC News' request for comment, the Trump transition team rebuked concern about potential price increases as a result of his tariff proposals.",
      "\"In his first term, President Trump instituted\u00a0tariffs\u00a0against China that created jobs, spurred investment, and resulted in no inflation. President Trump will work quickly to fix and restore an economy that puts American workers by re-shoring American jobs, lowering inflation, raising real wages, lowering taxes, cutting regulations, and unshackling American energy,\" Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the transition team, told ABC News in a statement.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about which products will be most impacted by Trump\u2019s tariffs:",
      "Electronics",
      "Smartphones, tablets and laptops are among the array of electronics that would see price increases as a result of tariffs, experts said. Video cameras, headphones and video game consoles would also be impacted.",
      "\u201cElectronics are basically ubiquitous,\u201d Raymond Robertson, a professor of trade and public policy at Texas A&M University, told ABC News. \u201cI don\u2019t know how this wouldn\u2019t be incredibly disruptive.\u201d",
      "Prices of laptops and tablets could rise as much as 46%, while smartphone prices could jump 26%, according to a study published last month by the Consumer Technology Association, a trade group that represents tech firms.",
      "Many of those goods are imported from China, which would face the steepest tariffs under Trump\u2019s proposal, Handfield said. Since Trump plans to also impose tariffs on all imported goods, manufacturers would not be able to circumvent the tariffs by shifting production to other countries, he added.",
      "Imports account for roughly 90% of video and audio electronic equipment sold to U.S. consumers, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis found in 2017. Meanwhile, 88% of electronic computers and 78% of small electric appliances are imported, the BEA said.",
      "\u201cThe prices of electronics would definitely go up,\u201d Handfield said.",
      "Clothes",
      "Jeans, T-shirts, sweatshirts and a host of other apparel items are set to go up in price if Trump\u2019s tariffs take effect, experts said.",
      "The U.S. imports more than 80% of clothing items offered up by retailers, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data last year showed.",
      "For decades, the U.S. has increasingly relied on apparel manufacturers in China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and other low-cost markets abroad, said Jason Miller, a professor of supply-chain management at Michigan State University.",
      "\u201cObviously, and not surprisingly, apparel is very strongly imported,\u201d Miller said.",
      "The price of a set of 500 apparel goods ranging from swimwear to gloves to baby clothes could rise as much as 20% in response to the potential tariffs, according to a study earlier this month by the National Retail Federation, a trade association that represents retailers.",
      "After the proposed tariffs, a $50 woman\u2019s cotton sweater could cost consumers as much as $60 while the price of men\u2019s jeans could rise from $80 to $96, the NRF found.",
      "Toys",
      "Dolls, stuffed animals and board games are among a group of toys highly vulnerable to tariff-related price increases, experts said.",
      "Imports account for about 90% of toys and dolls sold to U.S. consumers, U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data in 2017 showed.",
      "Top U.S. toy makers are \u201cvery, very dependent on China,\u201d Handfield said. \u201cAlmost all toys are manufactured in Asia.\u201d",
      "The price of toys could soar as much as 55%, amounting to about $14 billion in lost U.S. consumer spending power, the NRF found.",
      "The price of a $50 tricycle could jump an additional $28, while a plush toy could climb from $17 to $27.",
      "Economists face challenges forecasting the exact price increase since it remains unclear whether firms involved in the supply chain for products, such as toys, will take on a share of the added cost by relinquishing some profits or will pass along all of the cost to customers, Miller said.",
      "The current body of academic research, however, suggests that many companies will add the full cost of tariffs onto the consumer.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 14:36:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Advocacy groups opposing Donald Trump's plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants are pre-drafting lawsuits that could be filed as soon as he takes office.",

      "Trump has vowed to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "Immigration advocacy groups and Democratic leaders are seeking to disrupt President-elect Donald Trump's plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants by pre-drafting lawsuits that could be filed as soon as he takes office.",
      "Trump has vowed carry out what he calls \"the largest deportation operation\" in the country's history, and has pledged to reinstate and expand his controversial ban on people coming into the U.S. from certain majority-Muslim countries as part of his immigration policy.",
      "On Monday, he re-emphasized on Truth Social that he is prepared to declare a national emergency and use military assets to carry out his promise of mass deportation.",
      "Several immigration advocates and Democratic leaders told ABC News they have spent months preparing for the prospect of another Trump presidency and the expected crackdown on immigrants that Trump and his newly tapped border czar Tom Homan have promised.",
      "Homan, who has embraced Trump's pledge to undertake mass deportations on \"Day 1\" of the new administration, oversaw the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) during the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" enforcement that separated parents from their children at the border.",
      "\"In California, we've been thinking about the possibility of this day for months and in some cases, years, and been preparing and getting ready by looking at all of the actions Trump said he will take,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta told ABC News.",
      "Bonta said his team has prepared briefs on several immigration issues that Trump mentioned on the campaign trail. including mass deportations, birthright citizenship, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and sanctuary cities.",
      "\"There will be pain and harm inflicted by him. It is not all avoidable, but to get to our immigrant communities in ways that are in violation of the law, they're going to have to go through me, and we will stop them in courts using our legal tools given to us,\" Bonta said.",
      "The California attorney general claims that 80% of the state's legal challenges against the immigration executive orders and policies from Trump's first term were successful.",
      "\"We're very confident that we will block major efforts by the federal administration, that we will be able to blunt some of the worst of it,\" Bonta said.",
      "The 24 Democratic state attorneys general across the United States hope to present a unified front to block the Trump administration's immigration policy by using his first term as a blueprint, according to Sean Rankin, the president of the Democratic Attorneys General Association.",
      "\"When we look at immigration, we know that that is something that the president has talked about over and over and over again,\" Rankin told ABC News. \"At this point, we're not connecting dots. We're following flashing arrows. It's very easy to see where they're going to go.\"",
      "One of Homan's targets in his mass deportation plan are sanctuary states and cities -- places that have enacted laws designed at protecting undocumented immigrants. The policies, which vary by state, generally prohibit city officials from cooperating with the federal immigration authorities.",
      "\"They better get the hell out of the way,\" Homan said last week, regarding the governors of sanctuary states. \"Either you help us or get the hell out of the way, because ICE is going to do their job.\"",
      "Leaders in several sanctuary cities have said they are going to fight back using all the tools legally available to protect immigrant communities.",
      "\"We have been doing the work in this office to prepare for a lot of different hypotheticals and we will be prepared to face those with every tool that we have,\" said Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson at a press conference last week.",
      "Ferguson told reporters that between 2017 and 2021, his legal team defeated 55 \"illegal actions\" and policies from the Trump administration. But while his office has been preparing litigation for months, Ferguson said he believes the second Trump administration will also be better prepared than the first one.",
      "\"One of many reasons why we were successful with our litigation against the Trump administration was they were often sloppy in the way they rolled out and that provided openings to us to prevail,\" Ferguson told reporters. \"In court this time around, I anticipate that we will see less of that, and that is an important difference.\"",
      "In addition to considering the use of the military to carry out deportations, Trump and his allies have suggested using an obscure section of the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts -- a set of 18th century wartime laws -- to immediately deport some migrants without a hearing.",
      "Lee Gelernt, the deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Immigrants' Rights Project, told ABC News that they have been preparing for the potential use of the military to conduct deportations.",
      "\"They're going to try and use the military, under the alien enemies act, to summarily deport people,\" Gelernt said. \"We will try and challenge it immediately.\"",
      "Gelernt, who led the ACLU's legal response to family separations in Trump's first term, said he expects the upcoming Trump administration to be \"worse for immigrants\" than the first.",
      "\"The Trump team has apparently been preparing for four years to implement anti-immigrant policies, and the rhetoric in the country has gotten so much more polarized than it was in 2016,\" Gelernt said.",
      "During Trump's first term, Gelernt said groups like the ACLU were caught off-guard with some of his executive orders like the travel ban -- but this time around, the organization has been preparing litigation for almost a year. In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld Trump's controversial ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries, which the Biden administration later eliminated. Since then, Trump has appointed two Supreme Court justices.",
      "\"We are plotting out our challenges with much more advanced preparation, and we are doing our best to coordinate among all the various NGOs [non-governmental organizations] around the country,\" Gelernt said.",
      "\"As litigators, we've been convening, we've been preparing, we've been trying to anticipate the unimaginable as we walk into the next four years,\" said Alina Das, co-director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at the New York University School of Law.",

    "story": [
      "Sgt. DeRicko Gaither made the complaint about the tattoo in 2021.",
      "The National Guardsman who in 2021 pegged Pete Hegseth as a potential \"insider threat\" clarified in an interview with ABC News that his complaint targeted\u00a0a \"Deus Vult\" tattoo on the former Fox News host's arm -- not a cross on his chest, as Hegseth has repeatedly claimed.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump last week tapped Hegseth to lead the Department of Defense. He listed Hegseth's experience as a veteran and his media experience as his reasons for the choice.",
      "As\u00a0Reuters\u00a0and The\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0first reported, Sgt. DeRicko Gaither sent an image of the \"Deus Vult\" tattoo to Maj. Gen. William Walker shortly before President Joe Biden's inauguration. The phrase, which translates from Latin to \"God wills it,\" has been co-opted by white nationalist groups, experts have said.",
      "\"This information is quite disturbing, sir,\" Gaither wrote in the email to Walker, who has not responded to ABC News' request for comment. \"This falls along the lines of (an) Insider Threat.\"",
      "Hegseth claimed in his book \"The War on Warriors\" that his \"orders were revoked\" ahead of Biden's inauguration because fellow service members had flagged a tattoo of the Jerusalem Cross on his chest as a white nationalist symbol.\u00a0As a result, Hegseth wrote, he resigned from the military.",
      "But Gaither clarified in a text message to ABC News that his complaint targeted the \"Deus Vult\" tattoo, despite\u00a0\"the narrative that has been out there.\"",
      "\"Just so we are clear. This has NOTHING to do with the Jerusalem Cross tattoo on his chest,\"\u00a0Gaither wrote in the text.\u00a0\"This has everything to do with the 'DEUS VULT' Tattoo on his inner bicep.\"",
      "Gaither\u2019s sensitivity to what he described as the \"disturbing\" imagery in Hegseth's tattoos came at a time when the military was grappling with the fact that\u00a0dozens of active and former\u00a0service members had participated in the Jan. 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Gaither, who confirmed to ABC News the contents of his complaint -- which he wrote just one week after Jan. 6, emphasized that\u00a0\"this wasn't then and isn't now a personal attack towards Pete Hegseth.\"",
      "\"The information received and [the] email sent on January 14th was the protocol that had to be followed because of the position assignment that I was assigned to,\"\u00a0explained Gaither, who was at the time assigned as the Guards' head of security. \"The protocol was followed and would be followed again if this issue involved any other service member, myself included.\"",
      "As ABC News has reported,\u00a0Hegseth fired back\u00a0at the initial coverage of this matter in The Associated Press by claiming it was \"Anti-Christian bigotry.\"",
      "\"They can target me \u2014 I don\u2019t give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD,\" Hegseth wrote on X.",

    "story": [
      "Officials and experts spoke with ABC News about what he hopes to achieve.",
      "So far, President-elect Donald Trump's proposed nominations and appointments to the highest ranks of government have included no shortage of unconventional and even controversial selections.",
      "But when it comes to the positions that will drive American foreign policy, Trump has opted for more conventional conservative picks, selecting Republicans with long track records of staunch support for Israel and hawkish views on U.S. adversaries, including Iran.",
      "As Trump prepares to enter the Oval Office and confront intractable conflicts in the Middle East, ABC News spoke to officials and experts about what the team the president-elect has chosen says about how he'll approach the troubled region and what he hopes to achieve.",
      "Almost as soon as it became clear that Trump had won the White House again, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shared his congratulations on what he called \"history's greatest comeback.\"",
      "In the run-up to the election, Netanyahu made little effort to hide his preference for Trump, believing that although the former president could be capricious, he was likely to give Israel free rein to manage its national security and prosecute its wars against Hamas and Hezbollah, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Now, Netanyahu's bet appears poised to pay off.",
      "Trump announced he had tapped former Arkansas governor and two-time candidate for the Republican Party presidential nomination Mike Huckabee to be his ambassador to Israel.",
      "Huckabee, a Baptist minister, has little experience with Middle Eastern policy, but he has made dozens of trips to Israel, including hosting tours to holy sites in the country. He has also made several public comments supporting Israeli expansion into the occupied West Bank, refusing to say the Palestinian territory is \"occupied.\"",
      "\"There are certain words I refuse to use. There is no such thing as a West Bank. It's Judea and Samaria,\" Huckabee said in 2017, using the Israeli terms for the territory that is internationally recognized as the West Bank .",
      "\"There's no such thing as a settlement. They're communities. They're neighborhoods. They're cities,\" he added.",
      "While Huckabee has insisted \"I won't make the policy, I will carry out the policy of the president\" as envoy to Israel, some believe his selection indicates the second Trump administration might end the long U.S. pursuit of a two-state solution to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.",
      "Khaled Elgindy, the director of the Middle East Institute's Program on Palestine and Palestinian-Israeli Affairs at the Middle East Institute, says he also believes U.S. support for Israeli annexation of the West Bank and permanent occupation of the Gaza strip may be \"imminent\" when Trump takes power.",
      "\"If nothing else, under Trump, the United States will continue to provide unlimited weapons to Israel but without any of the pretense about concern for civilian lives, U.S. law, or international law that prevailed during the Biden administration,\" he said.",
      "\"Unlike Joe Biden, who projected occasional displeasure with Benjamin Netanyahu's government and its conduct in Gaza and the West Bank, the Trump administration is unlikely to object to any Israeli violations on the ground,\" Elgindy added.",
      "Trump has also named another champion of Israel, New York GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik as his pick to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "In the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, Stefanik has been an outspoken critic of the U.N.\u2019s handling of the conflict. She also made headlines for taking on university presidents during a congressional probe into antisemitism on college campuses in 2023.",
      "However, retired U.S. Army Col. Seth Krummrich, former chief of staff for special operations of U.S. Central Command and the vice president of the security firm Global Guardian, says that rather than siding with Israel's hardliners, Trump will move Netanyahu toward the middle in pursuit of broader, regional deals with Arab states.",
      "\"If he can get compromise on a two-state solution, President Trump will be in a position to create and to get exactly what he wants, which is normalized relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia,\" he said.",
      "Establishing diplomatic ties between Israel and Saudi Arabia has been the single aim driving the Biden administration's Middle East policy both before and after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel. But during his first term in office, Trump also worked toward integrating Israel with Arab states and ultimately oversaw the brokering of the Abraham accords, which includes bilateral agreements between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and Bahrain.",
      "Krummrich says Trump's largely like-minded foreign policy Cabinet selections, including his nominee for secretary of state, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, will put the incoming administration in a place to capitalize on relationships that were forged during his first term in the Oval Office.",
      "\"As he has reloaded his team this time, he has executors. He doesn't have debaters,\" Krummrich says.",
      "One of the president-elect\u2019s first staffing decisions was to appoint Steve Witkoff, a real estate mogul who was golfing with Trump at Mar-a-Lago when he was the target of an apparent attempted assassination in September.",
      "Like Huckabee, Witkoff is a strong supporter of Israel with limited foreign policy expertise. But although his negotiation experience centers on property sales rather than peace deals, some experts think an entrepreneurial approach to the region could play to the incoming administration\u2019s benefit.",
      "Ibrahim Al-Assil, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, says that although leaders of Arab states are wary of the volatility Trump brings to the geopolitical landscape, they have often responded favorably to Trump\u2019s preferred, business-like brand of diplomacy.",
      "\"Gulf leaders, particularly those from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have long appreciated Trump's direct, transactional approach to foreign policy,\" Al-Assil said. \"They believe they can navigate complex issues with a president who values relationships over bureaucratic norms.\"",
      "When it comes to Iran, Trump's first term in office was defined by his \"maximum pressure\" campaign, as he withdrew from an Obama-era nuclear deal with the country and sought to weaken the regime by ramping up sanctions and eliminating the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani.",
      "This time, Trump appears prepared to push Iran even harder, lining his Cabinet with similarly minded Iran hawks like Rubio and his pick for national security adviser, Florida GOP Rep. Mike Waltz.",
      "\"Trump's incoming national security team has promised to ratchet up economic pressure on Tehran once again. His administration will likely exert far less restraint than the Biden administration on Israel's campaign to degrade Iran and its proxies' capabilities,\" said Suzanne Maloney, vice president and director of the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution.",
      "But she warns the second Trump administration may have trouble replicating the success of its first sanctions campaign.",
      "\"The early success of Trump's 'maximum pressure' sanctions relied on the willingness of major powers such as China to abide by them; that has long since eroded,\" she said, adding that dismantling evasion networks will also pose a challenge.",
      "However, Krummrich says if Trump's team can bring Israel and Saudi Arabia together, it would deal a devastating blow to Tehran.",
      "\"If Israel and Saudi Arabia align and normalize relationships, that absolutely isolates Iran,\" he said. \"Getting the Abraham accords to be fully realized ... that will absolutely change the landscape of the Middle East.\"",

      "Hovde doubled down on claims of voting inconsistencies he made last week.",

      "Hovde, who last week said he was weighing whether to request a recount due to \"voting inconsistencies,\" maintained in his statement that the ballots may lack \"integrity\" and \"legitimacy.\"",
      "\"I have heard from numerous supporters urging me to challenge the election results. However, without a detailed review of all the ballots and their legitimacy, which will be difficult to obtain in the courts, a request for a recount would serve no purpose, because you will just be recounting the same ballots, regardless of their integrity,\" Hovde said in a video posted on X. \"As a result, and my desire to not add to political strife, through a contentious recount, I've decided to concede the election.\"",
      "As of noon on Monday, with 99% of the vote counted, Baldwin led Hovde by .9%, or about 27,000 votes of the 3.3 million cast.",
      "But Hovde on Monday also doubled down on claims of voting \"inconsistencies\" he made last week, including his assertion there was an \u201cimprobable\u201d dump of absentee ballots in Milwaukee on Election Night that were overwhelming for Baldwin and that Democrats engaged in voter deception.",
      "\"The results from election night were disappointing, particularly in light of the last minute absentee ballots that were dropped in Milwaukee at 4 a.m. flipping the outcome. There are many troubles around these absentee ballots and their timing, which I addressed in my last statement,\" he said on Monday.",
      "\u201cI am proud that we received 1.6, 4 million votes, more than any Republican in Wisconsin history aside from President Trump's total on Tuesday night. Furthermore, if not for Democratic operatives placing a phony American first candidate on the ballot to deceive voters and siphon off over 28,000 votes, I would have won this race,\u201d he said.",
      "The Milwaukee Election Commission swiftly pushed back in a statement last week on what it called Hovde\u2019s \u201cbaseless claims\u201d about election integrity, describing his central allegation of voting inconsistencies as \u201cexpected and routine.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe MEC celebrates the dedication of Milwaukee residents to participate in the democratic process and is fully confident that Mr. Hovde\u2019s accusations lack any merit. Milwaukee voters can rest assured: the MEC conducted a fair, accurate, and secure election that fully protects voter rights and preserves the democratic process,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Hovde on Monday said that his plans are to return to his work in business. He also said that any \u201cfair-minded\u201d person would also be disappointed in the race\u2019s outcome but he did not regret running.",
      "\u201cAfter running from morning to night for nine months and leaving it all on the field, I will take a much needed break, then return to my businesses and foundation and find other ways to make a positive impact,\u201d Hovde said.",
      "\u201cAny fair minded person would say no, obviously the outcome is not what I had hoped for, but I do not regret entering this race. I'm passionate about our country and the future we are leaving our children and grandchildren,\u201d he said."

      "With President-elect Donald Trump's vows to radically revise the United States' immigration system during his second term, Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas, said deportations should narrowly focus on convicted criminals.",
      "\"You know, if we're going after the guy that's picking tomatoes or the nurse at the local hospital and we're not going after the convicted criminal, then our government has failed us,\" Gonzales told ABC News' Martha Raddatz in an interview on \"This Week.\"",
      "Trump has promised a mass deportation operation beginning on \"day one\" of his second term, saying he would carry out these plans with the help of local law enforcement and the national guard. There are nearly 11 million people in the United States without permanent legal status, according to the Pew Research Institute and the American Immigration Center.",
      "Amidst these threats, Gonzales said \"legal immigration should never be mixed with these hardened criminals.\"",
      "\"Our country was built on those fleeing persecution,\" he said. \"And it would be just absolutely terrible if we don't protect those that are doing it the right way.\"",
      "Gonzales, a Navy veteran, was elected to Congress in 2020. He represents Texas' 23rd Congressional District, which includes the largest swath of border territory of any House district, running 800 miles along Texas' southwestern border with Mexico.",
      "After narrowly surviving a primary challenge from the right this year, Gonzales won re-election earlier this month with around 60% of the vote.",

      "Pressed on the feasibility of Trump's plans, Gonzales responded, \"We need to focus on talking about the convicted criminal aliens,\" and to provide resources for finding them and deporting them.",
      "\u201cAnd you do that by making sure that these task forces have the resources they need. You pull local, state and federal resources to go after these criminals, you find them, you deport them.\u201d",
      "Many of Trump's selections for his second term team have made clear their hardline views on immigration, including his pick for deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, who said that \"America is for Americans and Americans only\" at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally in October.",
      "Pressed on Miller's statement, Gonzales responded that \"This American first movement is very real, because they feel as if lots of Americans are doing all the things they're supposed to do, and somehow they're in the back of the line.\"",
      "He called for an end to division and said, \"We got to get back to everybody rowing in the same direction.\"",
      "Asked about Trump's appointment of former Rep. Matt Gaetz for attorney general, someone Gonzales once called a \"scumbag,\" the congressman replied that \"I want him to do good things for our country\" and emphasized the need for unity.",
      "Trump's appointment for secretary of defense Pete Hegseth has stirred up controversy with past comments that women should not serve in the military.",

      "Speaker's short-term plan could cause a funding fight in Trump's first 100 days.",
      "After a weekend spent with President-elect Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson laid out a tentative plan on Sunday to keep the government funded that, if passed, could tee up a funding fight in the earliest days of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "During an appearance on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Johnson said if the House can\u2019t finish individual funding bills then \u201cwe\u2019ll have a temporary measure. I think that would go into the first part of next year and allow us the necessary time to get this done.\u201d",
      "Congress must take some action to avert a government shutdown before Dec. 20, when current funding will expire.",
      "But the plan Johnson outlined is far from what other Republicans in both the House and Senate have previously advocated for. Many Republicans were hopeful Congress would act during the lame duck session to fund the government through the end of the fiscal year in October.",
      "How Congress proceeds in the next few weeks could set the table for what Trump\u2019s earliest legislative actions will be.",
      "The plan Johnson outlined would see current government funding levels extended through March, giving a Republican-controlled Congress the ability to shape a funding bill almost immediately after Trump assumes the presidency.",
      "Though Johnson said he\u2019ll continue to work to fund the government before the December deadline, he ultimately endorsed a short term funding bill that would kick the deadline into next spring.",
      "\u201cI think that would be ultimately a good move because the country would benefit from it, because then you'd have Republican control. And we'd have a little more say in what those spending bills are,\u201d Johnson told Fox News.",
      "If Congress waits until the spring to fund the government, Republicans will control the House, Senate and White House, possibly buying them more leverage in negotiations, but it hasn\u2019t always worked out that way.",
      "Trump was handed this sort of situation as he entered office for his first term. In December 2016, with Trump having clinched the presidency and Republicans preparing to take control of both the House and Senate the next month, Congress decided to kick the deadline to fund the government to April 2017.",
      "But that extended funding deadline didn\u2019t necessarily buy Republican major wins. Though Trump did have more ability to influence that funding bill as a result of the delay, he still ended up having to make concessions, including a delay in funding of his border wall, in order to get the government funded in time. Congress, hamstrung by a pending funding deadline, spent much of Trump\u2019s first 100 days squabbling over funding rather than focusing on building out new policy.",
      "Ultimately, Trump signed a largely bipartisan funding bill into law in early May, averting a government shutdown by mere hours.",
      "Johnson\u2019s proposal could also potentially protect him from a public funding fight with his far-right flank just weeks before the House will once again vote on whether Johnson keeps his gavel, though these members are also generally opposed to short-term funding bills like the one Johnson is pitching.",
      "Trump endorsed Johnson last week to lead House Republicans in the 119th Congress, calling him a \u201cgood guy.\u201d",
      "Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted from his role largely because of his failure to enact budget cuts palatable to his far-right members.",
      "Keeping a low profile with a short-term funding extension may, therefore, be just what Johnson needs headed into the speaker election.",
      "Johnson\u2019s pitch is in sharp difference from what other Republicans have telegraphed in recent weeks.",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise told reporters he wants to pass government funding through the end of September 2025 to avoid any delays in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.",
      "Senate Republicans have similarly expressed interest in locking in a deal to keep the government funded through to October.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine is the top Republican appropriator in the Senate. Last week, before Johnson outlined his plan, Collins said she would continue to advocate for Congress to fund the government through September with regular-order appropriations bills instead of a short-term bill like the one Johnson is proposing.",
      "\u201cIn my judgment that is better for the incoming administration because that gives them a clean slate, and they can start focusing on the budget for Fiscal Year '26,\u201d Collins said last week.",
      "Democrats also have cards to play. The government funding deadline falls before the new Congress is sworn in and before Trump is inaugurated. With the Senate in their control, Democrats are better positioned to negotiate a full-year funding bill that locks in their priorities now than they will be in the new year.",
      "But any effort to complete a full year\u2019s worth of funding bills will need to be quickly expedited to get things completed before the deadline. The Senate has still not passed any of the individual funding bills, and top appropriators need to agree on a top-line funding bill.",

    "title": "Why Biden's Ukraine ATACMS green light might mean peace talks pressure for Putin",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 08:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "It is perhaps on the diplomatic front that ATACMS will make the largest impact.",
    "story": [
      "Kyiv will now be allowed to fire the American weapon into the Kursk region.",
      "LONDON -- Ukraine is expected to soon begin using American-made ATACMS missiles to hit military targets in Russia's western Kursk region, after President Joe Biden lifted restrictions on Kyiv's use of the long-range weapon following months of pressure.",
      "Three U.S. officials confirmed to ABC News on Sunday that Biden had authorized Ukraine to use the ATACMS -- officially called the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System -- in Russia's western Kursk region.",
      "There, Moscow's troops -- now supported by North Korean forces, according to U.S. officials -- have been fighting to defeat a Ukrainian incursion since August. Kyiv's forces in Kursk are already using American- and European-made armored vehicles, including tanks.",
      "Ukrainian troops have been using the cluster munition and unitary variants of the ATACMS since October 2023 to hit Russian targets on occupied Ukrainian territory. The White House withheld permission for Ukraine to strike within Russia for fear of retaliation from Moscow and concerns about available stocks.",
      "Approval to use the 190-mile-range weapon to hit targets in Kursk is politically significant. Biden will soon be out of the White House, and President-elect Donald Trump's apparent skepticism towards continued aid to Kyiv has raised concerns of a sudden drop-off in U.S. aid.",
      "The ATACMS green light in Kursk might produce relatively limited battlefield results, experts told ABC News, though the looming future threat to other Russian regions may increase pressure on Moscow in any revived peace talks.",
      "The Institute for the Study of War think tank said in its Sunday evening update that the \"partial lifting\" of restrictions on Western long-range weapon use in Kursk \"will not completely deprive Russian forces of their sanctuary in Russian territory, as hundreds of military objects remain within ATACMS range in other Russian border regions.\"",
      "Ivan Stupak, a former officer in the Security Service of Ukraine, told ABC News the decision -- while a \"decisive\" White House move -- will not \"change anything on a global scale.\"",
      "\"The number of missiles and targets on Russian territory are strictly limited,\" Stupak added. \"It could help to eliminate 1-2,000 Russian servicemen and about 150 units of heavy equipment,\" he continued, and help \"significantly slow down Russia's rolling advance in the Kursk region.\"",
      "Dan Rice, who served as a special adviser to former Ukrainian commander-in-chief Gen. Valery Zaluzhnyi and has been involved in Kyiv's push for several advanced American weapons, said the White House decision was \"slow, deliberate and telegraphed.\"",
      "\"The ATACMS' 300-kilometer maximum range doesn't reach that far,\" added Rice, who is now the president of the American University Kyiv. \"It can't reach airfields, factories or energy infrastructure deep within Russia.\" Longer-range weapons like Tomahawk cruise missiles, Rice added, would help stop intensifying Russian missile and drone strikes.",
      "A senior U.S. defense official confirmed to ABC News on Monday that Ukraine has not yet used any ATACMS missiles on Russian soil.",
      "Stupak said Ukrainian commanders would be best served targeting major military warehouses, repair centers and airfields, rather than concentrations of Russian or North Korean manpower.",
      "The \"rockets will speak for themselves,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a Monday post to social media.",
      "It is perhaps on the diplomatic front that ATACMS will make the largest impact.",
      "European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Monday he hoped European nations would follow suit. Discussions are ongoing as to restrictions on Kyiv's use of long-range British-French Storm Shadow/SCALP cruise missiles inside Russia, while Ukraine is still pushing Germany to provide Taurus cruise missiles.",
      "In Moscow, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told journalists that the reported White House decision would represent \"a qualitatively new round of tension and a qualitatively new situation from the point of view of the involvement of the United States in this conflict.\"",
      "Washington, D.C., Peskov added, is adding \"fuel to the fire.\"",
      "The Russian Foreign Ministry directed reporters to previous comments made by President Vladimir Putin. In September, Putin said approval for long-range strikes using Western weapons within Russia would mean \"that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries are at war with Russia.\"",
      "Trump's presidential election victory has revived discussions of cease-fire and peace talks, the president-elect having vowed to end the war in 24 hours by forcing Zelenskyy and Putin to the negotiating table.",
      "Moscow is intensifying its long-range and ground attacks, seemingly to strengthen its hand if talks do indeed resume once Trump returns to the Oval Office.",
      "Ukrainian military analyst Sergey Bratchuk wrote on Telegram that Biden's decision is \"a great move,\" though comes \"very late.\"",
      "The president, he added, \"just strengthened his negotiating position. Now the map of long-range strikes is on the table and we will have to reckon with it, whether Russia wants it or not.\"",
      "Oleksandr Merezhkko -- a member of the Ukrainian parliament and the chair of the body's foreign affairs committee -- concurred that the approval \"gives us a better chance to win the war.\"",
      "\"It would be better to lift any restrictions on the use of Western weaponry deep into the territory of Russia,\" he told ABC News. \"It would allow us better defense of our territory. Such a move might force Putin to negotiate in earnest.\"",
      "\"He doubles down when he sees weakness,\" Merezhko added of Putin. \"The only way to restrain him is to respond to his actions with more strength.\"",

    "story": [
      "A lawyer for Hegseth said the former Fox News host was a \"blackmail\" victim.",
      "Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump's pick for defense secretary, paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault in 2017 as part of a settlement agreement, an attorney for Hegseth said in a statement on Saturday.",
      "Tim Parlatore, a lawyer for the former Fox News star, said in the statement that Hegseth settled in December 2020 only because he feared his career would suffer if her allegations were made public. Parlatore said Hegseth was the victim of \"blackmail\" and \"false claims of sexual assault\" by an unidentified woman after a Republican women's convention in California on Oct. 7, 2017.",
      "\"Knowing that it was the height of the MeToo movement and any public accusation would result in his immediate termination from Fox, Mr. Hegseth ultimately decided to enter into a settlement for a significantly reduced amount,\" according to the statement.",
      "In Parlatore's telling, Hegseth met the woman an event after-party, where he became \"visibly intoxicated.\" The woman \"led him by the arm to his hotel room\" where the two engaged in a \"consensual sexual encounter.\"",
      "\"The complainant was the aggressor in initiating sexual activity,\" Parlatore wrote.",
      "As ABC News has previously reported, the woman filed a police report days later but no charges were filed. Two years later, according to Parlatore, the woman \"began to make noise about filing a lawsuit against Mr. Hegseth.\" Her co-workers \"warned us of the threat,\" prompting Hegseth and his legal team to send her a cease-and-desist letter.",
      "Parlatore did not reveal the amount of the settlement.",
      "According to The Washington Post, Parlatore's statement -- which was first reported  by the newspaper -- came after a friend of the alleged victim sent a memo to Trump transition officials last week drawing their attention to the incident.",
      "The memo, which ABC News has not obtained or reviewed, reportedly said that the woman -- who was described by the Post as a then-30-year-old conservative group staffer -- was responsible for ensuring that Hegseth made it back to his hotel room at the end of the night.",
      "In a post on X, Trump\u2019s team said the president-elect is standing by Hegseth.",
      "\u201cMr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed,\u201d Stephen Cheung, Trump\u2019s communications director, said. \u201cWe look forward to his confirmation as United States Secretary of Defense.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s team has not replied to ABC News\u2019 request for comment. The person who sent the memo to the transition team did not respond to requests for comment from The Post.",
      "According to the memo, two other women summoned her over when Hegseth became \"pushy about his interest in taking them upstairs to his room.\"",
      "After the two other women left, the woman \"didn't remember anything until she was in Hegseth's hotel room and then stumbling to find her hotel room.\" The next day, she \"had a moment of hazy memory of being raped the night before, and had a panic attack,\" the memo read.",
      "The woman then went to an emergency room where a rape-kit examination \u201cwas positive for semen,\u201d the Post reported the memo said.",
      "Monterey city officials said in a statement that police investigated a \"sexual assault\" that allegedly occurred in the early morning hours of Oct. 8, 2017, at a Hyatt Regency. The incident did not involve a weapon, but the victim allegedly suffered \"contusions to right thigh.\"",
      "Hegseth is not identified in the city's statement as the alleged assailant. The victim\u2019s name and age are listed as \"confidential.\"",
      "A police report was filed days later, on Oct. 12. A Monterey Superior Court spokesperson told ABC News on Thursday there no records on file with Hegseth\u2019s name as a party."

    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue",
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.",
      "The airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.",
      "The airline's shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.",
      "Those were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.",
      "It\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.",
      "Those were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.",
      "Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "ROME -- The ancient Roman Colosseum will be the venue of gladiator fights \u2014 albeit staged \u2014 for the first time in two millennia under a $1.5 million sponsorship deal with Airbnb that aims to promote \u201ca more conscious tourism.\u201d",
      "But some visitors to the monument Thursday, as well as housing activists, were skeptical about the value of the arrangement, citing ongoing controversies in many cities over the role of short-term rental platforms in fueling overtourism and limiting affordable housing for residents and students.",
      "Under the deal announced by Airbnb and the Colosseum on Wednesday, the sponsorship by the short-term rental giant will cover the renewal of an educational program inside the ancient Roman amphitheater covering the history of the structure and gladiators.",
      "Eight of the platform's users and their plus-ones will be able to participate in faux gladiator fights after the Colosseum's closing time on May 7-8, taking the same underground route used by gladiators in ancient Rome to reach the arena. People can apply for the experience on Nov. 27 at no cost, and the \u201cgladiators\u201d will be chosen by lottery.",
      "The superintendent of the Colosseum Archaeological Park, Alfonsina Russo, told The Associated Press that the deal is in conjunction with the release of Ridley Scott's new film \u201cGladiators II,\" which opened in Italy on Thursday.",
      "Russo characterized the sponsorship arrangement as one of the many such deals to help finance projects at the park.",
      "The Italian fashion brand Tod's, for example, has funded a multimillion renovation of the Roman monument, including a cleaning, replacing the locking system of arches with new gates and redoing the subterranean areas.",

      "Tourists from other European cities grappling with overtourism also took issue with the deal.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that the purpose of the Colosseum today is to be a tourist attraction, but not to create an amusement park within it,\u201d said Jaime Montero, a tourist visiting from Madrid. \u201cIn the end, tourism eats the essence of the cities, here in Rome, as in other capitals.\u201d",
      "Visiting from Naples, Salvatore Di Matteo saw the deal as \u201cyet another takeover of the territory\u201d by big companies.",
      "\"If they start to touch sacred monuments such as the Colosseum here in Rome, it is obviously something that should make us think and is, in any case, a bit worrying,\" he said.",

      "Authorities say only six monkeys are still on the loose after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research",
      "YEMASSEE, S.C. -- Six monkeys were still on the loose early Monday after dozens escaped earlier this month from a South Carolina compound that breeds the primates for medical research, according to authorities.",
      "Two more Rhesus macaques were trapped Sunday outside the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee, bringing the total of recovered monkeys to 37 of the 43 that escaped, Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard said in a statement relayed by Yemassee Police in a social media post.",
      "Both monkeys recaptured Sunday were examined and were in \u201cexcellent condition,\u201d said Westergaard, who was present when they were recovered.",
      "\u201cI can attest with absolute certainty that their spirits were high and they showed all the outward signs of being happy well-adjusted monkeys,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are very pleased that the animals recovered thus far are in such good condition, and that they show no ill effects from their outdoor adventure.\u201d",
      "All the monkeys taken back to the compound have been fed peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and monkey biscuits, which are a high protein Purina Monkey Chow that is specially formulated for the rhesus macaques, Westergaard said.",
      "Two other monkeys were spotted near the traps Sunday afternoon and Alpha Genesis planned to begin trapping efforts before dawn Monday and continue through the day.",
      "Forty-three monkeys made a break for it Nov. 6 after an employee at what locals call \u201cthe monkey farm\u201d did not fully lock their enclosure, police said.",
      "There are three gates keeping the monkeys inside their containment area and a worker is supposed to lock and latch one gate before opening another, but all three gates and latches were left unsecure allowing the primates to escape, Westergaard told WCSC-TV last week.",
      "Westergaard said it appears the worker made a mistake and did not intentionally leave the gates where the monkeys could escape.",
      "\u201cMy understanding is that immediately after the incident occurred, the employee\u2019s supervisor approached her and stated that she could be terminated if it was determined that there was no structural failure which led to the escape,\u201d Westergaard told the TV station. \u201cI am told at that point the employee walked off the job and has not returned.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis has said efforts to recover all the monkeys will continue for as long as it takes at its compound about a mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee and about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "On Monday, a group called Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent another letter to federal officials asking for fines and further inspection of Alpha Genesis for animal mistreatment.",
      "The letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture said a monkey was found dead with its head stuck in a fence and a second strangled in gauze used to secure water bottles. The letter also details several earlier escapes, including one where a monkey had its arm ripped off and another had its arm broken by a tranquilizer dart.",
      "The incidents involved about 30 monkeys and happened in 2022 or earlier. The letter includes emails and other documents from Alpha Genesis given to the group by someone inside the company, wrote Michael Budkie, the group's executive director.",
      "\u201cThis is not animal care, this is neglect and abuse. Though these violations may be back a couple of years ... there is no reason to assume that such a broad set of violations will be totally remedied,\u201d Budkie wrote.",
      "Alpha Genesis did not return a phone call or email asking about the letter.",
      "The USDA has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020. The facility\u2019s most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues and veterinarians found minor problems in only one of the facility\u2019s past six inspections.",
      "Humans have been using the monkeys for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe Rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "The monkeys pose no risk to public health, Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police have all said. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical facilities and other researchers.",
      "If people encounter the monkeys, they are advised to stay away from them \u2014 and to not fly drones in the area. The company said they are skittish and might run away from where they are gathered."

      "Survivors of clergy sexual abuse are urging the Vatican to adopt the same zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002",
      "ROME -- Survivors of clergy sexual abuse urged the Vatican on Monday to expand its zero-tolerance policy that it approved for the U.S. Catholic Church in 2002 to the rest of the world, arguing that children everywhere should be protected from predator priests.",
      "The U.S. norms, adopted at the height of the abuse scandal there, say a priest will be permanently removed from church ministry based on even a single act of sexual abuse that is either admitted to or established under church law.",
      "That \u201cone strike and you\u2019re out\u201d policy in the U.S. has long stood out as the toughest in the church. It is held up by some as the gold standard, by others as excessive and by still others as imperfect but better than most. It was adopted by U.S. bishops as they scrambled to try to regain credibility following the revelations of abuse and cover-up in Boston documented by the Boston Globe\u2019s \u201cSpotlight\u201d series.",
      "Since then, the church abuse scandal has erupted globally, and survivors from around the world said Monday there\u2019s no reason why the U.S. norms couldn\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be applied universally. They called for changes in the church\u2019s in-house canon law and reasoned they could be approved since the Holy See already approved the norms for the U.S. church.",
      "\u201cDespite Pope Francis\u2019 repeated calls for zero tolerance on abuse, his words have yet to lead to any real action,\u201d said Gemma Hickey, a transgender survivor of abuse and the president of the global survivor network Ending Clergy Abuse.",
      "The proposal launched at a press conference was hammered out during an unusual meeting in June in Rome between survivors and some of the Catholic hierarchy's top priestly experts on preventing abuse. It was described by participants at the time as a \u201chistoric collaboration\u201d between two groups that often talk past one another, given victims' deep distrust of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "The priestly participants in that meeting included the Rev. Hans Zollner, who heads the church\u2019s main academic think tank on safeguarding; the No. 2 at the Vatican\u2019s child protection advisory board, Bishop Luis Manuel Ali Herrera; and the Gregorian University\u2019s canon law dean, the Rev. Ulrich Rhode as well as diplomats from the U.S., Australian and other embassies.",
      "However, there was apparently no one from the Vatican legal office, secretariat of state or the discipline section of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, which processes all abuse cases worldwide and largely sets policy on applying the church\u2019s canon law \u2014 albeit in secret since its cases are never published.",
      "As a result, it was unclear what would become of the proposed policy changes, given the U.S. norms only came about because U.S. bishops pushed the Vatican to approve them, driven by their outraged flocks and insurance companies.",
      "Nicholas Cafardi, a U.S. canon lawyer who was an original member of the U.S. National Review Board that provided input to the 2002 U.S. norms, said globalizing that policy into universal church law \u201cwould be one of the logical next steps\u201d for Francis to take to continue the fight against abuse.",
      "But Cafardi, author of \u201cBefore Dallas,\u201d about the lead-up to the 2002 Dallas bishops' meeting that approved the norms, said that some bishops today bristle at how the policy limits their authority and freedom. And in a telephone interview, he noted that even in the U.S., the norms are only still in place because the U.S. bishops keep formally asking to keep them, which he acknowledged was a \u201cweakness\u201d in the system.",
      "\u201cIt seems to me that a good protection would be \u2018Let\u2019s just make it universal law,\u2019\u201d said Cafardi. \u201cOnce you have that law, you don\u2019t have to worry about the bishops asking for it in country after country. It\u2019s just the law.\"",
      "However, the proposal faces an uphill battle since the Vatican in recent years has repeatedly insisted on \u201cproportionality\u201d in its sentences for abuse, refusing to apply a one-size-fits-all approach and taking into account cultural differences in countries where abuse isn't as openly discussed as it is in the West.",
      "That has resulted in seemingly light punishments for even confirmed cases of abuse which, in the U.S., would have resulted in a priest being permanently removed from ministry.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Clinton's presidential library and museum is planning a major update and expansion as it celebrates 20 years of being open",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Twenty years since Bill Clinton opened his presidential library and museum before a rain-soaked crowd, the area around the glass and steel facility has been transformed.",
      "The museum fueled development around Little Rock's once-sleepy downtown, with a former industrial area to its east blossoming into an entertainment district. Next to the building, cyclists and runners regularly cross what was once a railroad bridge spanning the Arkansas River.",
      "But little has changed inside the museum, which features many of the same exhibits unveiled two decades ago: touchscreen displays where visitors can pull up Clinton's daily schedules, replicas of the Oval Office and Cabinet Room, electronic tickers scrolling with the 42nd president's accomplishments.",
      "That's about to change, as library officials are marking the 20th anniversary of its opening and planning for a major update and expansion that will add Hilary Rodham Clinton's personal archives.",
      "\u201cWe need to refresh the current exhibits, the technology,\u201d Stephanie Streett, the executive director of the Clinton Foundation said.. \u201cThe story is not going to change, the story of the Clinton administration and the work he did.\u201d",
      "But library officials are looking at how to add context to major decisions that were made during the Clinton administration. The changes comes as views have evolved among fellow Democrats about some of Clinton's accomplishments, including his 1994 crime bill. Library officials say they plan to revisit some of those decisions and their impact on today.",
      "\u201cIt does remain an interesting era, and the Clinton administration obviously shaped the 1990s,\u201d Jay Barth, the library's director, said. \u201cSo I think that's the story we tell, the interplay between that era of the 1990s and this administration.\u201d",
      "Library officials haven't given a timeline or cost for the planned expansion. Streett said it would also include more community spaces for events, programs and student groups.",
      "Clinton remains an active political figure and has evolved into a elder statesman figure in the Democratic Party, delivering a primetime speech and campaigning on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the presidential election. His library turned 20 on Monday, the day before he releases a memoir about his years since leaving office in 2001.",
      "The expansion will allow the library to tell more about Hillary Rodham Clinton. She has remained a high-profile figure since her time as first lady through her work in the Senate, as secretary of state and her two unsuccessful presidential bids.",
      "The expansion will include an institute that will serve as a hub for the former first lady\u2019s nonprofit and advocacy work. Hillary Clinton\u2019s papers from her time as first lady are already held in the presidential library\u2019s archives.",
      "\u201cI think it is a fascinating, distinctive story that really resonates with a different audience, a slightly younger audience, but really an audience of all ages because of how important her role was in American life,\u201d Barth said.",
      "The library is the centerpiece of a 29-acre (nearly 12-hectare) park that was once a warehouse district. The campus includes the University of Arkansas' Clinton School of Public Service.",
      "More than 5 million people have visited the center since the facility opened in a ceremony that drew dignitaries and celebrities. The library remains a major draw for the city, with tour groups regularly visiting it and local groups holding events at the facility's great hall.",
      "The tourism attention is what library planners had hoped for when the site, located next to an interstate in the city's downtown, was chosen.",
      "\u201cWe knew we would get the political attention because of the Clinton presidency,\u201d said Skip Rutherford, the former head of the Clinton Foundation who oversaw the library's planning, construction and opening. \u201cWe knew there would be the political attention, both good and bad. What we hoped for was we\u2019d get the tourism attention.\u201d",
      "The library is marking the opening's anniversary with a series of events in early December that will include a conversation with the former president about his new book. The library has also been selling souvenirs to mark the occasion. They include a Christmas ornament that features the image of an umbrella \u2014 a reminder of the soggy opening ceremony \u2014 as well as mugs and postcards with images from that day.",
      "A week after the election, the library's visitors included Mary Jordan from Phoenix, who stopped by on the way home from North Carolina. Jordan said visiting the library made her appreciate even more Clinton's presidency and his ideals.",
      "\u201cIt certainly makes me appreciate America and what we stand for and our democracy, and I hope we never lose that,\u201d she said."

      "SEATTLE -- SEATTLE (AP) \u2014 Boeing said in a notice filed with Washington's Employment Security Department on Monday that it has so far laid off 2,199 workers in the state, among job cuts that will eventually total about 17,000 across the company.",
      "The aerospace giant announced in October that it planned to cut about 10% of its workforce in the coming months as it struggles to recover from financial and regulatory troubles as well as a strike by its machinists that lasted nearly two months.",
      "The planned cuts include workers at Boeing facilities across the country, from Washington to Missouri to Arizona to South Carolina, The Seattle Times reported. They also appeared to impact workers in all three of Boeing\u2019s divisions: commercial airplanes, defense and global services.",
      "Before the layoff notices delivered last week, Boeing had 66,000 workers in Washington.",
      "Among the layoffs so far are notices that went out last week to more than 400 members of Boeing's professional aerospace labor union, the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, or SPEEA. The workers will remain on the payroll through mid-January.",
      "Boeing\u2019s unionized machinists began returning to work earlier this month following the strike.",
      "The strike strained Boeing\u2019s finances. But CEO Kelly Ortberg said on an October call with analysts that it did not cause the layoffs, which he described as a result of overstaffing.",
      "Boeing, based in Arlington, Virginia, has been in financial trouble since two crashes of its 737 Max jetliner killed 346 people in 2018 and 2019. The company's fortunes and reputation took a further hit when a panel blew off the fuselage of an Alaska Airlines plane in January.",
      "Production rates slowed to a crawl, and the Federal Aviation Administration capped production of the 737 MAX at 38 planes per month, a threshold Boeing had yet to reach when the machinists' strike halted assembly lines."

      "Figures released Monday by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement show the casinos and their online partners won $213.6 million in October, surpassing September's previous record of $208 million.",
      "When in-person casino winnings, internet and sports betting revenue are included, the nine casinos, two horse tracks that take sports bets and their online partners won just under $500 million in October, an increase of 2.6% from a year ago.",
      "But internet and sports betting money is not solely for the casinos to keep; it must be shared with outside parties including sports books and tech platforms. For that reason, the casinos consider money won from in-person customers to be their core business.",
      "And that business continues to lag for two-thirds of the casinos. Only three casinos \u2014 Borgata, Hard Rock and Ocean \u2014 won more from in-person gamblers last month than they did in October 2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.",
      "The swing toward internet gambling and away from in-person casino gambling accelerated during the pandemic, and is becoming a more permanent feature of New Jersey's gambling landscape.",
      "Jane Bokunewicz, director of the Lloyd Levenson Institute at Stockton University, which studies the Atlantic City gambling industry, said the trend is becoming more obvious.",
      "\u201cDespite a historically dry and very mild October, brick-and-mortar gaming operators in Atlantic City did not see strong gains over 2023, instead declining by 8.5% year-over-year,\u201d she said.",
      "But total revenue for the casinos was up over 9% from a year ago, \u201cin no small part due to internet gaming, which continued a record streak,\u201d she said.",
      "James Plousis, chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, noted that internet revenue surpassed in-person casino revenue for the first time in October, excluding the few months in 2020 when the physical casinos were closed due to the pandemic.",
      "He also noted that internet gambling revenue exceeded $200 million for the second straight month.",
      "\u201cThese two accomplishments are emblematic of the importance of online gaming as a component of the evolving casino business,\u201d he said.",
      "In terms of in-person gambling revenue, Borgata won $53.4 million, down 6.1% from a year earlier; Hard Rock won $40.8 million, down 1%; Ocean won $32.8 million, down over 24%; Tropicana won $17.6 million, up 7.4%; Harrah's won $15.7 million, down 11.5%; Caesars won just under $15 million, up 4.1%; Resorts won $12 million, down over 9%; Bally's won $11.4 million, down 7.8%; and Golden Nugget won $9.6 million, down over 20%.",

      "ATHENS, Ga. -- A Georgia appeals court on Monday canceled oral arguments that were scheduled for next month on the appeal of a lower court ruling allowing Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis to continue to prosecute the election interference case she brought against President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Trump and other defendants had asked the Georgia Court of Appeals to hold oral arguments in the case, and the court had set those arguments for Dec. 5. But in a one-line order with no further explanation, the appeals court said that hearing \u201cis hereby canceled until further order of this Court.\u201d",
      "A Fulton County grand jury in August 2023 indicted Trump and 18 others, accusing them of participating in a sprawling scheme to illegally try to overturn the 2020 presidential election in Georgia. Four defendants have pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors, but Trump and the others have pleaded not guilty.",
      "But with Trump set to return to the White House in January, the future of the case against the once and future president was already in question even if the Court of Appeals ultimately says Willis shouldn't be disqualified.",
      "Trump and other defendants filed the appeal seeking to get Willis and her office removed from the case and to have the case dismissed. They argue that a romantic relationship Willis had with special prosecutor Nathan Wade created a conflict of interest. Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee in March found that no conflict of interest existed that should force Willis off the case, but he granted a request from Trump and the other defendants to seek an appeal of his ruling from the Court of Appeals.",
      "McAfee wrote that \u201creasonable questions\u201d over whether Willis and Wade had testified truthfully about the timing of their relationship \u201cfurther underpin the finding of an appearance of impropriety and the need to make proportional efforts to cure it.\u201d He allowed Willis to remain on the case only if Wade left, and the special prosecutor submitted his resignation hours later.",
      "The allegations that Willis had improperly benefited from her romance with Wade resulted in a tumultuous couple of months in the case as intimate details of Willis and Wade\u2019s personal lives were aired in court in mid-February."

      "The Small Business Administration has run out of money for a program that provides low-interest loans for businesses, nonprofits and homeowners trying to rebuild after a disaster. Biden is seeking $2 billion for that program. Several other agencies would also receive emergency funds if Congress agrees to the full request.",
      "Lawmakers were expecting a hefty number from the administration. Johnson, R-La., said Congress will evaluate the request and \u201cwe\u2019ll make sure we deliver for the hurricane victims and the people that have suffered from that.\u201d",
      "Johnson had also visited western North Carolina after Hurricane Helene to assess the damage. At the time, he said Congress would act in a bipartisan fashion to help communities recover, but he also said it would be \u201dthe appropriate amount that the federal government should do.\u201d",
      "With many Republicans campaigning on reducing federal spending, there could be some debate about portions of Biden's request. The federal government doesn't help with every disaster. It generally gets involved only if the needs are above the ability of a community or state to handle.",
      "Republicans are also outraged that a FEMA employee directed workers helping hurricane survivors not to go to homes with yard signs supporting Donald Trump's presidential campaign. The agency's leader, Administrator Deanne Criswell, said the employee was fired and the directive was a clear violation of the agency's core values to help people regardless of political affiliation.",
      "The Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to hear Wednesday from the heads of several of the government agencies that would receive funding through Biden's request. It's possible that emergency aid could be attached to any spending bill designed to keep federal agencies operating after current funding expires Dec. 20.",
      "Biden noted that Congress had provided more than $90 billion in aid after Hurricane Katrina nearly two decades ago, and more than $50 billion after Hurricane Sandy in 2013. He urged Congress to take \u201cimmediate action.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust as the Congress acted then, it is our sworn duty now to deliver the necessary resources to ensure that everyone in communities reeling from Hurricanes Helene and Milton \u2014 and those still recovering from previous disasters \u2014 have the Federal resources they need and deserve,\u201d Biden wrote.",

    "story": [
      "A federal bankruptcy judge in Texas is being asked to disqualify a winning bid made by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars",
      "A company affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones asked a federal judge on Monday to disqualify a bid by the satirical news outlet The Onion to buy Jones' Infowars at a bankruptcy auction, alleging fraud and collusion.",
      "The company, First United American Companies, which is affiliated with a Jones website that sells dietary supplements, was the only other bidder at the recent auction, offering $3.5 million. In a filing in federal bankruptcy court in Houston, a lawyer for the company asked the judge to declare it the winning bidder instead of The Onion.",
      "The lawyer, Walter Cicack, claimed that the bankruptcy trustee overseeing the auction improperly colluded with The Onion and families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut in naming The Onion the winning bidder. Cicack also alleged the trustee violated rules for the sale set by the judge, and said the company's cash offer was twice the amount of The Onion's.",
      "The bankruptcy auction was held last week as part of the liquidation of Jones\u2019 assets, including Infowars. Proceeds from the sale will go to Sandy Hook families and other creditors. Jones filed bankruptcy in 2022 after he was ordered to pay nearly $1.5 billion in defamation lawsuits filed by the families for calling the 2012 shooting that killed 20 children and six educators a hoax staged by actors to increase gun control.",
      "Ben Collins, CEO of The Onion\u2019s parent company, Chicago-based Global Tetrahedron, issued a statement Monday through a spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re obviously disappointed he\u2019s lashing out by creating conspiracies, but we\u2019re also not surprised,\u201d he said, referring to Jones.",
      "The bankruptcy trustee appointed to oversee the sale, Christopher Murray, declined to comment Monday. A lawyer for the Sandy Hook families, Christopher Mattei, also declined to comment.",
      "In a response filed in court later Monday, Murray called the allegations \u201cbaseless.\u201d He said the motion by First United American to disqualify The Onion was \u201ca disappointed bidder\u2019s improper attempt to influence an otherwise fair and open auction process.\u201d",
      "Murray also wrote, \u201cHaving failed in its prior efforts to bully the Trustee and his advisors into accepting its inferior bid, FUAC now alleges, without evidence, collusion and bad faith in an attempt to mislead the Court and disqualify its only competition in the auction.\u201d",
      "Murray filed separate court papers Monday asking the judge to approve the sale of Infowars to The Onion.",
      "Monday's filing by First United American Companies included the formal bid submitted by The Onion, revealing that it offered $1.75 million for Infowars along with certain incentives by Sandy Hook families who won their defamation lawsuit against Jones. The families agreed to forgo up to 100% of their share of the Infowars sale proceeds and give it to other Jones creditors.",
      "With the families' offer, other Jones creditors would get a total of $100,000 more than they would get if First United American Companies bought Infowars, according to The Onion's bidding document.",
      "Murray told the bankruptcy judge during a court hearing Thursday that the families' incentives made it a better offer than the one by the Jones-affiliated company.",
      "\u201cThe creditors ended up significantly better off,\u201d Murray told the judge, adding that one of his responsibilities was to maximize value for creditors.",
      "Judge Christopher Lopez, who said he had questions about the sale process and concerns about transparency, ordered a hearing to see exactly what happened with the auction and how the trustee chose The Onion. The date of the hearing has not been set.",
      "Jones has been criticizing the sale process on his show and social media sites, calling it \u201crigged\u201d and a \u201cfraud.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, Collins posted a series of comments about the auction on X, formerly known as Twitter.",
      "\u201cLong and short of it: We won the bid and \u2014 you\u2019re not going to believe it \u2014 the previous InfoWars folks aren\u2019t taking it well,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Collins said last week that The Onion planned to turn the Infowars website into a parody site, taking aim at conspiracy theorists and other social media personalities while promoting gun violence prevention efforts.",
      "Cicack also said in Monday's court filing that the trustee improperly changed the auction process \u201cfrom a live auction to a secret process.\u201d Cicack said that after sealed bids were submitted Nov. 8, it was expected that there would be a round of live bidding on Nov. 13.",
      "But instead, he said, Murray decided to ask the two bidders to submit another offer as their final and best proposal, which they did. Murray then chose from those final bids without holding a round of live bidding. He alleged Murray violated the auction rules.",
      "Lopez's 20-page order on the sale procedures, issued in September, made such a live bidding round optional. And it gave broad authority to Murray to conduct the sale, including the power to reject any bid, no matter how high, that was \u201ccontrary to the best interests\u201d of Jones, his company and their creditors.",
      "Cicack called the Sandy Hook families' portion of The Onion's bid \u201cMonopoly\u201d money with no value.",
      "\u201cIt is also the product of impermissible collusion with the Onion in an effort to \u2018rig\u2019 the auction with the goal of achieving a specific result desired by the Connecticut Families,\u201d he wrote."

      "\u201cThis is a matter of grave concern that, most respectfully, must be addressed immediately,\u201d the lawyers told Judge Arun Subramanian, who already has scheduled a bail hearing for Friday for Combs. They requested an \u201cimmediate hearing\u201d so prosecutors can explained who authorized the search of Combs' cell, where personal effects and paperwork were seized.",

      "Miyares said in a video that he is running for attorney general to continue his tenure as Virginia\u2019s top prosecutor and near-decade experience as a politician. The announcement quiets questions about whether Miyares would run to succeed Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is term-limited by the state constitution.",

      "Miyares, 48, was elected in 2021 after serving as a local attorney and member of the House of Delegates from Virginia Beach. He defeated two-term Democrat Mark Herring, and quickly fashioned what had been a liberal office into a conservative enterprise.",

      "Also vying for the role are Democrats Jay Jones, a former state delegate from Norfolk, and Henrico County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Shannon Taylor, both of whom have been critical of Miyares. It's the second time Jones is seeking the Democratic nomination for attorney general. In 2021, he lost in a primary against Herring.",

      "Miyares is the only Republican currently running for his party\u2019s nomination, making the Democratic primary winner his likely opponent in a general election, unless another conservative challenges him.",
      "He had widely been seen in political circles as a possible gubernatorial candidate in 2025, along with Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who launched her campaign in September. During an interview in 2023, Miyares declined to say whether he was considering a run but said he's always flattered\u201d when he\u2019s asked the question.",
      "On Monday, Youngkin endorsed both Earle-Sears and Miyares in their campaigns, and said in a statement that the attorney general \u201cvigorously defends the laws of the Commonwealth.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe has never backed down when it comes to standing up for Virginians,\u201d Youngkin said. \u201cHe is an exceptional Attorney General.\u201d",
      "Miyares has developed a reputation in Virginia as a conservative stalwart, clashing with progressive prosecutors in Northern Virginia who touted a commitment to a reformed criminal justice system. In his tenure, he has developed a program in partnership with local governments in the state to target violent repeat offenders. His office also brought charges against Loudoun County officials after a student was charged in two sexual assaults at separate schools, though a judge overturned their only successful conviction following the high-profile investigation.",
      "Miyares also has deeper ties to key players in Washington, raising his national profile. Miyares\u2019 former communications director, Victoria LaCivita, is the daughter of Chris LaCivita, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s campaign co-chair. Victoria LaCivita left his office in 2024 to work for the Trump campaign in Michigan.",
      "As first reported by the Richmond Times-Dispatch, Miyares was also a Virginia co-chair of Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, and Rubio headlined a fundraiser for Miyares in December 2017. Both Rubio and Miyares are children of Cuban immigrants.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve worked to protect the American dream because it\u2019s personal for me,\" Miyares said in his campaign video, later adding: \"And as a child of an immigrant, one of the proudest things I get to do is to attend the naturalization ceremony and welcome these new Virginians home.\u201d",

      "Talmika Bates will receive $967,000 from the city of Brentwood, located about 60 miles (100 km) east of San Francisco in Contra Costa County, her attorneys announced Friday.",

      "The settlement comes six months after a federal judge stripped the officer handling the police K-9 of some of his qualified immunity protection, because the extended amount of time he allowed his dog to bite Bates could be considered by a jury as excessive force, her attorneys said.",

    "story": [
      "A report released Monday by Pew Research Center says about one in five Americans regularly get their news from so-called news influencers on social media",
      "About one in five Americans \u2013 and a virtually identical share of Republicans and Democrats \u2013 regularly get their news from digital influencers who are more likely to be found on the social media platform X, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The findings, drawn from a survey of more than 10,000 U.S. adults and an analysis of social media posts posted this summer by influencers, provide an indication of how Americans consumed the news during the height of the U.S. presidential campaign that President-elect Donald Trump ultimately won.",
      "The study examined accounts run by people who post and talk regularly about current events - including through podcasts and newsletters - and have more than 100,000 followers on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, X or TikTok. They include people across the political spectrum, such as the progressive podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen and conservative podcaster Ben Shapiro, as well as non-partisan personalities like Chris Cillizza, a former CNN analyst who now runs his own newsletter.",
      "The report found that news influencers posted mostly about politics and the election, followed by social issues like race and abortion and international events, such as the Israel-Hamas war. Most of them \u2013 63% - are men and the majority \u2013 77% - have no affiliation, or background, with a media organization. Pew said about half of the influencers it sampled did not express a clear political orientation. From the ones that did, slightly more of them identified as conservative than as liberal.",
      "During the campaign, both parties and presidential campaigns had courted influencers, including creators who weren't very political, to compete for voters who are increasingly getting most of their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "The Republican and Democratic national conventions had credentialed influencers to cover their events this past summer. Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Alex Cooper for her \u201cCall Her Daddy\u201d podcast and talked a little Bay Area basketball with the fellows on \u201cAll the Smoke.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump hung out with the bros on the \u201cBussin\u2019 With the Boys,\u201d \u201cFlagrant\u201d and the popular podcaster Joe Rogan as part of a series of appearances targeting young male voters.",
      "\u201cThese influencers have really reached new levels of attention and prominence this year amid the presidential election,\u201d Galen Stocking, senior computational social scientist at Pew Research Center, said in a statement. \u201cWe thought it was really important to look at who is behind some of the most popular accounts \u2013 the ones that aren\u2019t news organizations, but actual people.\u201d",
      "Even though 85% of news influencers have a presence on X, many of them also have homes on other social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.",
      "Racial minorities, young adults and adults with a lower income were more likely to get their news from news influencers, according to the report. Most of the people surveyed by Pew said news influencers have helped them better understand current events, while roughly a quarter say what they hear has not made much of a difference. A small share \u2014 9% \u2014 say influencers have confused them more.",
      "Media analysts have long been concerned about how influencers - most of whom don't have to abide by editorial standards - could fuel misinformation, or even be used by America's adversaries to churn out content that fits their interests. On social media, though, some influencers have positioned themselves as figures presenting neglected points of view.",
      "Pew, which is doing the study as part of an initiative funded by the Knight Foundation, said 70% of the survey respondents believe the news they get from influencers is somewhat different than what they hear elsewhere. Roughly a quarter said it was \u201cextremely or very different.\u201d",
      "The report found TikTok is the only one of the major platforms where influencers who identify as right-leaning do not outnumber those who are more liberal. Pew said news influencers on the short-form video app were more likely than those on other sites to show support for LGBTQ+ rights or identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community. The platform also had the smallest gender gap for news influencers.",

      "Testimony is continuing in the trial of the man accused of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley",
      "ATHENS, Ga. -- An FBI special agent testified Monday that electronic location data seems to place Georgia nursing student Laken Riley and the man accused of killing her in the same wooded area at the time of her death.",
      "Jose Ibarra, 26, is charged with murder and other crimes in Riley\u2019s death in February. He waived his right to a jury trial, meaning Athens-Clarke County Superior Court Judge H. Patrick Haggard is hearing the case and will alone decide on Ibarra's guilt or innocence.",
      "The killing of the 22-year-old woman added fuel to the national debate over immigration during this year's presidential campaign when federal authorities said Ibarra illegally entered the U.S. in 2022 and was allowed to stay in the country while he pursued his immigration case.",
      "FBI Special Agent James Burnie told the court Monday that he reviewed location data from Ibarra's cellphone and Riley's cellphone and smart watch. GPS data from Riley's watch very precisely puts her inside the wooded area with running trails where her body was found on Feb. 22. Pings between Ibarra's phone and cell towers and the fact his phone wasn't making any Wi-Fi connections at the time indicate he was also likely in the woods, Burnie said.",
      "Prosecutors also played a recording of a jail phone call from May between Ibarra and his wife, Layling Franco. FBI specialist Abeisis Ramirez, who translated the call from Spanish, testified that Ibarra told Franco that he had been at the University of Georgia looking for work, and that his wife repeatedly said she was fed up and that she wanted him to tell the truth.",
      "Franco \"continues to ask, \u2018What happened with the girl?\u2019\" and said Ibarra \u201cmust know something,\u201d Ramirez said. He responds: \u201cLayling, enough.\" Ramirez said Franco told Ibarra that it's crazy that police only found his DNA.",
      "Ibarra is charged with one count of malice murder, three counts of felony murder and one count each of kidnapping, aggravated assault, aggravated battery, hindering an emergency telephone call, tampering with evidence and being a peeping Tom.",
      "Ibarra took selfies of himself early on the day Riley was killed, according to testimony from an FBI agent who analyzed data from cellphones seized from the apartment where Ibarra lived with his two brothers and two other people. In the photos, Ibarra is wearing a black Adidas baseball cap and a dark hooded jacket.",
      "A few hours before Riley was killed, a man in a black Adidas baseball cap was captured on surveillance video at the door of a first-floor apartment in a University of Georgia housing complex. A female graduate student who lived there testified Monday that she heard someone trying to get inside her apartment when she was in the shower. As she looked through the peephole, the person ducked and walked away, but then she saw the same person peering into her window, she said.",
      "Police officers using a grainy screen shot from the surveillance video approached a man wearing a black Adidas cap the day after the killing. That turned out to be Diego Ibarra, one of Jose Ibarra's brothers.",
      "University of Georgia police Sgt. Joshua Epps testified that he was called to question Diego Ibarra outside the apartment where the Ibarras lived. Epps testified that the brother had no obvious recent injuries.",
      "Outside the apartment, police also questioned Argenis Ibarra, Jose Ibarra and Rosbeli Elisbar Flores Bello. Epps and Corporal Rafael Sayan, who speaks Spanish and helped with the questioning, testified that they noticed scratches on Jose Ibarra.",
      "When asked why his knuckles were red, Jose Ibarra told them it was because of the cold but didn't really explain several scratches on his arms, Sayan said.",
      "Security video from the apartment complex showed a man wearing a shirt with a distinctive pattern throwing something into a trash bin. A crime scene specialist from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation testified there was a lot of clothing in the one-room apartment but that she didn't find that shirt in the apartment and didn't find any bloody clothing.",
      "A police officer testified Friday that he found a dark hooded jacket in the trash bin seen in the video and that testing revealed Riley's blood on the hoodie.",
      "Flores Bello identified the man in the video as Jose Ibarra and confirmed that identification on the witness stand Monday. She said she had previously seen him wearing the dark hooded jacket and thought it was strange that he threw it away.",
      "Testifying through of an interpreter, Bello said she met Ibarra in Queens, New York. Ibarra's brother, Diego, lived in Athens and had been urging Ibarra to move there, saying they would find work. She traveled with Ibarra to join his brother in Georgia. She said they went to the Roosevelt Hotel, which served as an intake center for migrants, to ask for a \u201chumanitarian flight\u201d to Georgia in September 2023. When they arrived in Atlanta, a friend of Diego Ibarra picked them up and drove them to Athens.",
      "Riley was a student at Augusta University College of Nursing, which also has a campus in Athens, about 70 miles (113 kilometers) east of Atlanta."

      "High Street job losses are \"inevitable\", prices will rise, and shops will close as the result of the tax increases in the Budget and other rising costs, a group of the biggest retailers in the UK is warning.",
      "Tesco, Amazon, Greggs, Next, and dozens of other chains are urging the Treasury to reconsider some of the measures.",
      "In a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves, they said the \"cumulative burden\" of the Budget changes, and other policies already in the pipeline, would amount to an additional \u00a37bn in costs next year.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson said the government had had to \"make difficult choices to fix the foundations of the country\".",
      "Measures in the Budget, in particular a rise in the tax that firms pay on their staff's wages, have been met with a tide of criticism from business, who argue it will hold back growth.",
      "But concerns have been loudest among retailers and hospitality businesses, where many young people find their first jobs. Firms in those sectors are also facing higher costs from next year's rise in the minimum wage.",
      "The government has defended its tax rises as necessary to avoid cuts to public services, and the rise in the minimum wage, with a bigger boost for younger workers and apprentices, has been welcomed by trades unions.",
      "But the letter from the group of businesses belonging to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said: \"The sheer scale of new costs and the speed with which they occur create a cumulative burden that will make job losses inevitable, and higher prices a certainty.\"",
      "It added that with profit margins typically between 3% and 5% in the sector it would \"not be possible to absorb such significant cost increases over such a short timescale\".",
      "\"The effect will be to increase inflation, slow pay growth, cause shop closures, and reduce jobs, especially at the entry level.\"",

      "From next April, all large businesses will have to pay higher National Insurance Contributions (NICs) for every member of staff they employ. Employer NICs will start at a lower threshold than now- at \u00a35,000 instead of \u00a39,100. And the rate will rise from 13.8% to 15%. The BRC calculates this will cost British retailers \u00a32.33bn a year.",
      "The rise in the minimum wage from April is set to cost the sector a further \u00a32.73bn, the BRC letter said.",
      "In addition, from October 2025 a new packaging levy comes into force.",
      "Introduced by the previous government, the extended producer responsibility (ERC) scheme shifts the cost of recycling from local councils onto the companies that use the packaging. Smaller firms are exempt, but the new levy will cost the retail sector overall another \u00a32bn, the BRC estimates.",
      "The letter calls for the government to phase in the introduction of the NI changes and delay the start of the ERC.",
      "It also urges the government to reduce business rates, a property-related tax which the BRC says will cost retailers an additional \u00a3140m a year after next April.",
      "A Treasury spokesperson told the BBC that, thanks to exemptions for smaller businesses, \"more than half of employers will either see a cut or no change in their national insurance bills [and] there will be \u00a322.6bn more for the NHS\".",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:01:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Spray foam insulation was previously subsidised in England under the government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
    "story": [
      "Homeowners with spray foam insulation are struggling to sell or remortgage as some major lenders are rejecting properties with it fitted, the BBC has found.",
      "A quarter of the UK's biggest mortgage providers will not lend against homes with spray foam in the roof, our research suggests.",
      "It is estimated as many as 250,000 homes in the UK have this type of insulation, with much of it installed under the previous government's Green Homes Grant scheme.",
      "\"We were blissfully unaware of any issues to do with it until we put the house on the market,\" said Wendy Rowe, whose family struggled to sell her late father\u2019s home and paid thousands to have the insulation removed.",
      "Some mortgage firms are reluctant to deal with homes with spray foam insulation due to concerns over poor fitting leaving moisture trapped and roof timbers at risk of decay.",
      "But the Insulation Manufacturers Association said spray foam can be beneficial if properly installed, and it was worried homeowners could be needlessly driven to \"cowboy\" removals companies.",
      "Ms Rowe told the BBC that when her father Alan Chawner was offered spray foam insulation in his loft, he thought it would make his ex-council property in Leicester  warmer and cut his energy bills.",
      "As a pensioner who claimed the attendance allowance, the entire \u00a34,331 cost of the  installation was covered by the Green Homes Grant scheme, which ran in England until 31 March 2021.",
      "'Left high and dry'",
      "However, the work was not up to scratch, according to a report by Stephen Hodgson, the former boss of the Property Care Association (PCA) who now inspects properties with spray foam and trains surveyors.",
      "After sales stalled and difficult conversations with lenders, Ms Rowe agreed to replace the roof entirely, splitting the cost of nearly \u00a310,000 with new buyers.",
      "She said it has cost the family thousands more in surveyors' and administration fees and utility bills.",
      "The firm that installed the spray foam, SealSixty, gave the family \u00a3400 as a gesture of goodwill and said the work met all the requirements set out by the Green Homes Grant scheme at the time.",
      "Ms Rowe said that her family had been \"left high and dry\".",
      "\"It was installed under a government initiative, and you really don\u2019t expect them to turn their back,\" she said.",
      "What is spray foam insulation?",
      "Spray foam insulation has been used to stop heat escaping from roofs, lofts and attics for decades and comes in two forms.",
      "Closed cell spray foam is rigid once set. It is a better thermal insulator and was previously sold to stabilise failing roofs. But if it has been used inappropriately or installed poorly, it might put stress on timbers, restrict air circulation and put them at risk of decaying.",
      "Open cell spray foam remains soft once set and is only used for insulation. It is more breathable but is often installed where a highly-resistant underlay like bitumen felt is already present, stopping vapour from escaping.",
      "While a recent report by the Health and Safety Executive highlighted situations where using open cell was low-risk, it cautioned against applying it directly to roof tiles.",
      "Homes insulated in government scheme go mouldy",
      "'It cost me \u00a34,500 to repair foam insulation damage'",
      "The nature of spray foam can make it tricky for valuers acting on behalf of lenders to inspect the condition of roof timbers.",
      "When the BBC contacted the 20 largest lenders in the UK, five of them, TSB Bank, Skipton Building Society, Co-operative Bank, Principality and equity release lender Aviva - said they did not lend against properties where spray foam is found in the roof space.",
      "The Yorkshire Building Society and Metro Bank said they would not usually lend where there is a significant amount of spray foam.",
      "Equity release provider More 2 Life told the BBC it will only lend on properties with spray foam where it was fitted as part of an authorised new build and has the necessary documentation.",
      "Other lenders such as Lloyds, Nationwide, Barclays, the NatWest Group and Santander have said they consider applications on a case-by-case basis, and will take a valuer's report into account.",
      "They may, however, ask homeowners for documentation showing it has been installed correctly or for a specialist report to be carried out.",
      "In 2023, the PCA published an inspection protocol in a bid to help surveyors and lenders assess any potential risk in pitched roofs.",
      "But homeowners like Gary Wright feel like they have been \"left in limbo\".",
      "When his two-year fixed-rate mortgage was up for renewal, he hoped to find a better rate.",
      "But when he applied he was shocked to discover open cell spray foam had been installed in 2009. It had not come up during surveys when he had bought the house.",
      "He decided to remove most of the foam in the loft himself, after receiving several expensive quotes.",
      "A surveyor still recommended a full roof report and Mr Wright felt he had to renew his mortgage with his current lender at a less preferable rate.",
      "\"We know that in the next two years, we need to get this fixed, and I can\u2019t afford to right now,\" he said.",
      "\"This phrase 'spray foam' has created fear [among lenders] based on a lack of knowledge,\" Simon Storer, chief executive of the Insulation Manufacturers Association, told the BBC.",
      "He suggested \"hares were set running\" by previous industry guidance that has since been withdrawn.",
      "\"Insulating is a very good thing,\" he said, adding: \"But as with any building work, it needs to be done correctly\".",
      "He said the organisation was also concerned about unregulated companies targeting older, potentially vulnerable, homeowners pushing them to pay for an overpriced removal service during cold calls.",
      "The Homeowners Alliance (HOA) does not recommend installing spray foam until issues with lenders and rogue traders are resolved.",
      "Advice for homeowners",
      "For homes where it is already present, the HOA recommends:",

    "story": [
      "If it hadn't been for the squirrels, George Matthew's attempt to become a cocoa bean producer might have failed.",
      "His farming career began in the 1970s when he inherited a rubber plantation in the the southern Indian state of Kerala , which he managed alongside his career as a doctor.",
      "It was a bad time to inherit a rubber plantation, falling rubber prices meant it kept losing money. So, 10 years ago Dr Matthew decided to experiment with cocoa trees, hoping they would generate some funds to support the rest of the farm.",
      "He bought some saplings and planted them. It didn't go well.",
      "\"It was not that successful - most of the saplings died,\" he says.",
      "Squirrels appeared to be making the situation worse by grabbing cocoa bean pods and eating them.",
      "But those raids had an unexpected benefit -  cocoa seeds were spread all over the farm.",
      "\"All the scattered seeds soon grew in to plants and they were much healthier and stronger than the saplings I had planted,\" says Dr Matthew.",
      "\"The trick was in sowing the seeds,\" he realised.",
      "Today Mr Matthews has 6,000 cocoa trees on his 50 acres of land.",
      "\"I think it was the best decision I have made,\" he says.",
      "Despite having several regions with weather conditions suitable for cocoa trees, India only accounts for 1% of the world's cocoa bean production.",
      "Global production is currently dominated by West Africa, where C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana between them produce more than half of the world's annual output.",
      "Indian growers can only supply a quarter of the beans needed by Indian makers of chocolate and other confectionary.",
      "\"The challenge is that it is grown in very fragmented small holdings, so it does not get the kind of attention cocoa should get,\" says Renny Jacob, chairman of India Cocoa, a private company that has been growing and processing cocoa beans for more than 30 years.",
      "In particular he says that Indian farmers are poor at handling beans after they have been harvested. Once removed from their pods, beans go through a fermentation process at the farm, which can make a huge difference to their flavour.",
      "\"Cocoa fermentation is a critical process in the production of chocolate, transforming raw cocoa beans into a form suitable for chocolate making,\" says Sarin Partrick, chief executive of India Cocoa.",
      "\"This complex process involves several stages and the activity of various micro-organisms, which help develop the beans' flavour, aroma, and colour,\" he says.",

      "To raise the quantity and quality of cocoa bean production, the government has introduced several initiatives.",

      "In addition there are schemes to train farmers on the latest techniques for growing and processing beans.",
      "\u201cThere is a vast opportunity for Indian farmers to enter into cocoa cultivation and avail the benefits,\" says Dr Femina, who works in the government department tasked with developing cocoa production.",
      "Business is also investing in new cocoa tree vareities.",
      "Dr Minimol J.S., is the head of cocoa research at Kerala Agriculture University and is working with Cadbury to develop hybrid cocoa trees.",
      "In the project's orchard existing high-performing varieties are cross-bred with exotic species.",
      "So far the programme has come up with 15 new varieties.",
      "\"These are India's first hybrid, disease-resistant seeds,\" she says.",
      "\"The seeds are drought tolerant varieties, and have withstood temperatures of even 40C, which is usually not possible,\" she adds.",
      "The hybrids are also much more productive than traditional varieties.",
      "\"The global average production is 0.25 kilogram per year per tree.",
      "\"In Kerala, we get 2.5 kilograms per year per tree. In Andhra and Telangana, we are even getting a yield of four or five kilograms per tree per year,\" she says.",
      "India's production of cocoa beans has risen significantly. This year it hit 110,000 tonnes, up 40% from 2015. But it's still not enough to meet demand from local chocolate and confectionary makers.",
      "India's Cocoa Board estimates the demand from industry is rising at 15% per year.",
      "Founded in 2019, Kocoatrait is one of a new generation of Indian chocolate makers.",
      "Based in the east coast city of Chennai, the company only uses Indian cocoa beans.",
      "One reason for that is that locally sourced beans have a much smaller carbon footprint than beans that have been shipped from another continent.",
      "In addition, says Kocoatrait founder Nitin Chordia, Indian beans are cheaper than imports and have a distinctive flavour.",
      "Mr Chordia also runs an agricultural school, where  farmers are shown the latest innovations in fermenting and drying beans.",
      "\"We are constantly focussing on improving the post-harvest practices for cocoa farmers in India,\" he says.",
      "He adds that Indian farmers need to be producing higher quality beans.",
      "\"We are not able to compete with international players in the bulk cocoa bean segment,\u201d he says.",
      "While there has been improvement, Indian producers have some way to go.",
      "\"Over the last decade, in the fine-flavour cocoa bean segment, India has started to get noticed... but it will be several years before all Indian fine flavour cocoa beans reach a stage of large-scale international recognition.\"",
      "Back in Kerala, Dr Matthew reflects on his decade as a cocoa farmer.",
      "\"It's a tricky plant,\" he says. \"Last year I had no yield. So no farmer can depend solely on cocoa - one has to plant other trees along with it.\"",
      "Despite the challenges, he's optimistic. \"The future is bright, with huge demand.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:30:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Having built a $20bn oil refinery, Aliko Dangote is now at the heart of a row in the murky industry.",
    "story": [
      "Petrol production at Nigerian business tycoon Aliko Dangote\u2019s $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) state-of-the-art oil refinery ought to be some of the best business news Nigeria has had in years.",
      "But many Nigerians will judge its success on two key questions - firstly: \"Will I get cheaper petrol?\"",
      "Sorry, but probably no - unless the international price of crude drops.",
      "And secondly: \"Will I still have to spend hours watching my hair turn grey in a hypertension-inducing fuel queue?\"",
      "Hopefully those days are gone but it might partly depend on the behaviour of what Mr Dangote calls \"the oil mafia\".",
      "For much of the time since oil was first discovered in Nigeria in 1956, the downstream sector, which includes the stage when crude is refined into petrol and other products, has been a cesspit of shady deals with successive governments heavily involved.",
      "It has always been impossible to follow the money, but you know there is something dreadfully wrong when the headline \"Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil firm fails to pay $16bn in oil revenues\", pops up on your news feed, as it did in 2016.",
      "It is only in the last five years that the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been publishing accounts.",
      "The Africa head at the Eurasia Group think-tank, Amaka Anku, hails the Dangote refinery, in which the NNPC has a 7% stake, as \"a very significant moment\" for the West African state.",
      "\"What you had in the downstream sector was an inefficient, corrupt monopoly,\" she says.",
      "\"What the local refinery allows you to do is have a truly competitive downstream sector with multiple players who will be more efficient, profit making and they\u2019ll pay taxes.\"",
      "To put it bluntly, the population of this oil-rich nation has been conned on a colossal scale for many years.",
      "Oil revenue accounts for nearly 90% of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings but a relatively small number of business people and politicians have gorged themselves on the oil wealth.",
      "Aspects of the business model have been baffling, including that of Nigeria\u2019s four previously existing oil refineries.",
      "Built in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, they have fallen into disrepair.",
      "Last year Nigeria\u2019s parliament reported that over the previous decade the state had spent a staggering $25bn trying and failing to fix the moribund facilities.",
      "So Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has been exporting its crude which is then refined abroad, much to the delight of some well-connected traders.",
      "It would be like a bakery with a broken oven. But rather than fix it, the owner sends balls of dough to another firm that shoves them in a working oven and sells the loaves back to the baker.",
      "The NNPC swaps Nigeria\u2019s crude oil for the refined products, including petrol, which are shipped back home.",
      "Exactly how much money changes hands and who benefits from these \"oil swaps\" is just one of the unknowns in these deals.",
      "\"No-one has been able to nail down who exactly has benefited. It\u2019s almost like a beer parlour gossip about who is getting what,\" says Toyin Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "The NNPC began subsidising the price of petrol in the 1970s to cushion the blow when global prices soared. Every year it clawed this money back by depositing lower royalty payments - the money it received for every barrel pumped out of the ground - with the Nigerian treasury.",
      "In 2022 the subsidy cost the government $10bn, more than 40% of the total money it collected in taxes.",
      "On his second day in office Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President Kashim Shettima referred to \"the fuel subsidy scam\" being \"an albatross around the neck of the economy\".",
      "Nigerian oil expert Kelvin Emmanuel says in 2019 the country\u2019s official petrol consumption \"jumped by 284% to 70m litres per day without empirical evidence to justify such a sharp increase in demand\".",
      "Parliament has previously reported that - at least on paper - importers were being paid to bring in far more petrol than the country consumed. There was a lot of money to be made exporting some of the subsidised petrol to neighbouring countries where prices were far higher.",
      "The NNPC earned billions of dollars a year from the crude oil production. But for many years, under previous governments, some of its profits never reached the treasury as it was accused by state governors and federal lawmakers of including these inflated subsidy costs on its balance sheet.",
      "The NNPC did not respond to a request for an interview or a response to these allegations but in June denied it had ever \"inflated its subsidy claims with the federal government\".",
      "It may have been the main source of revenue for successive governments but for decades, until 2020, the board did not disclose its audited accounts. Its press release from March this year promised more transparency and accountability.",
      "After coming to power in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy was unsustainable and suddenly cut it - pump prices immediately tripled.",
      "He also stopped the policy of artificially propping up the value of the local currency, the naira, and let market forces determine its value.",
      "When he took over, the exchange rate was 460 naira to the US dollar. In November 2024 it was over 1,600.",
      "The triple shock of higher fuel prices, sporadic shortages of supply and a depreciating currency has been a tough body blow for people across the country, many of whom are forced to run generators to keep the lights on and phones charged.",
      "\"Beyond the financial burden, the uncertainty and stress of constantly dealing with fuel shortages have added a layer of anxiety to everyday tasks,\" is how one Lagos resident summed it up.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m always navigating through crisis mode. It\u2019s exhausting.\"",
      "As the naira plunged and pump prices increased several times, the government, aware of the potential danger of protests, continued to pipette some medicine to the masses.",
      "In a move which could be likened to swallowing half a paracetamol for acute appendicitis, the government made sure people were paying slightly less than the market rate for a litre of petrol.",
      "In other words, the NNPC was selling at a loss and the subsidy was still alive.",
      "But with two recent increases in October, Nigerians are now paying market prices for fuel for the first time in three decades. In the main city Lagos it went up from 858 naira ($0.52) to 1,025 naira per litre.",
      "One of the major factors in Nigeria\u2019s economic crisis has been a limited supply of foreign currency. The country does not export enough products and services to bring in the dollars.",
      "But lots of people, including fuel traders, have been chasing the same limited supply of foreign currency, which leads to the naira losing even more value.",
      "The good news is that Mr Dangote\u2019s facility is going to buy crude and sell refined fuels in Nigeria in the local currency, which will leave more dollars available for everyone else.",
      "The bad news for those hoping this will mean cheaper fuel is that the price Mr Dangote pays for a barrel of local crude will still be the naira equivalent of the international cost in dollars.",
      "So if the price of crude goes up on the world market, Nigerians will still be forced to fork out more naira. Refining locally will mean less freight costs but that\u2019s a relatively small saving.",
      "It is hoped that the arrival of Mr Dangote\u2019s oil refinery will help bring a measure of transparency to the sector.",
      "He knew he would be upsetting some of those who benefit from the murky status quo when the $20bn project began. But, he says, he underestimated the challenge.",
      "\"I knew there would be a fight. But I didn\u2019t know that the mafia in oil, they are stronger than the mafia in drugs,\" Mr Dangote told an investment conference in June.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want the trade to stop. It\u2019s a cartel. Dangote comes along and he\u2019s going to disrupt them entirely. Their business is at risk,\u201d says Mr Emmanuel, the oil expert.",
      "The fact that there have been some public disagreements with the regulator has only fuelled that suspicion.",
      "Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery near Lagos is thirsty, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude a day.",
      "You would have thought being located in Nigeria would make supply easy but then up pops this headline: \"Nigeria\u2019s Dangote buys Brazilian crude\".",
      "It follows a row over supply and pricing. The regulatory authority has complained about Mr Dangote\u2019s negotiating tactics.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is low in sulphur and, as one of the most prized in the world, fetches a higher price than many of its competitors.",
      "When discussions over price began, Farouk Ahmed, the chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), accused Mr Dangote of \"wanting a Lamborghini for the price of a Toyota\".",
      "Mr Dangote has complained of not being allocated as much crude as earlier agreed but even when the price issue is resolved, he will still need to import some crude.",
      "\u201cNNPC doesn\u2019t have enough crude for Dangote. Despite all this instruction to give ample supply of crude to the refinery, NNPC can\u2019t supply Dangote with more than 300,000 barrels per day,\" says Mr Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "He says this is partly because the NNPC has pre-sold millions of barrels of oil for loans.",
      "In August 2023 it secured a $3bn loan from the Afreximbank financial institution. In return it is due to supply 164 million barrels of crude.",
      "In September the NNPC admitted it was significantly in debt. It was reported to be owing its suppliers around $6bn for fuel brought into the country.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s oil production has plummeted in recent years from around 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to around 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.",
      "The NNPC has been stressing oil theft as the number one reason why production has dropped.",
      "It says in just one week - from 28 September to 4 October - there were 161 incidents of oil theft across the Niger Delta and 45 illegal refineries were \"discovered\".",
      "But Ms Anku believes that \"the theft problem is overrated by the NNPC and the oil sector\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a convenient excuse,\u201d she adds.",
      "She points to other contributing factors causing the drop in production, including international oil companies selling their on-shore oil fields - some of which may no longer be viable having pumped oil for 60 years.",
      "The 66-year-old Dangote, who is listed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the second wealthiest person in Africa, made his fortune in cement and sugar.",
      "He has always denied the suggestion that his empire benefitted from links to politicians in power who helped ensure he had a monopoly.",
      "Today there are those who are critical of Mr Dangote\u2019s tactics and amid tension with the regulatory authorities, the same accusation has resurfaced when it comes to the supply of fuel in Nigeria.",
      "\"Mr Dangote asked me to stop issuing licences for importation and that everyone should buy from him. To which I said 'No' because it\u2019s not good for the market. We have energy security interests,\" says Mr Ahmed of the regulatory authority.",
      "Mr Dangote has not commented on the accusation but has said it makes business sense for the traders to buy from his refinery rather than from outside.",
      "A feud between the regulator and Mr Dangote over supplies and pricing has rumbled on and morphed into another row with local fuel traders refusing to buy from the new refinery.",
      "The mud slinging has also included allegations that some traders have been buying up substandard fuel from Russia which is then blended with other products before being shipped into Nigeria.",
      "But not everyone is worried or surprised by the disagreements.",
      "Ms Anku points to lessons learnt from US businessmen back in the 19th Century.",
      "\"The JP Morgans and the Stanfords \u2013 they didn\u2019t have it easy either. That\u2019s why they had to go and get government support and subsidies to build their railways and so on.",
      "\"I see the drama as a very normal process as you\u2019re changing the structure of the economy. There are losers, they lash out. There\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll stop the refinery from working or selling its products to the Nigerian markets\u2026 in my view.\"",
      "The modern, local refinery has also led to a debate over the quality of fuel on the market. It is an important issue given the vast number of generators belching out fumes across Nigeria as a result of the woeful power supply.",
      "\"Every day I wake up to the smell of what I\u2019m sure [could] kill me. It\u2019s because of the quality of the diesel,\" says Mr Akinosho.",
      "He sees Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery as a real opportunity for higher quality petroleum products in Nigeria which would be better for both car engines and people\u2019s lungs.",
      "But right now, Nigerians being hit hard in the pocket may find it difficult to be optimistic.",
      "Arguments between officials at the Dangote refinery, the oil marketers and the regulators are batted back and forth in the media. All sides have been accused of hiding some facts and figures which leaves people guessing what is going on inside this still somewhat opaque industry.",
      "\"Everyone is a villain. There are no heroes here,\" concludes Mr Akinosho.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 22:32:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Lenders have been raising the cost of fixed-rate deals creating a headache for buyers and those remortgaging.",
    "story": [
      "Mortgage costs are rising - with the average rate on a two-year fixed deal now at 5.5% - despite a recent cut in interest rates.",
      "A string of lenders, including Barclays, HSBC, NatWest and Nationwide, have increased the rates charged on new fixed deals in recent days.",
      "That has created a headache for borrowers hoping costs were on a consistent downward trend, especially in light of the Bank of England cutting the benchmark interest rate earlier this month.",
      "Recent events, such as the Budget, mean that borrowing costs in general have increased, which may have a knock-on effect for those searching for a home loan.",
      "How mortgage rates affect borrowers",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move fairly closely in line with the Bank's base rate. However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals.",
      "The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of potential first-time buyers also hope to get a place of their own with their first mortgage. All would welcome low mortgage rates.",
      "There have been two significant spikes in the last couple of years, with the average rate peaking at 6.85% in August 2023, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts.",
      "Rates are lower now, but the cost of deals has been moving up either side of the Budget.",
      "The average rate on a two-year deal now stands at 5.5%, and the average on a five-year deal is 5.22%.",
      "Nearly all of the cheapest deals on the market, often for those able to offer a large deposit, have risen back above a rate of 4%.",
      "Why are interest rates down but mortgage rates up?",
      "On 7 November, the Bank of England cut the base rate - which influences the wider cost of borrowing for businesses, individuals and the government - from 5% to 4.75%.",
      "This had been widely expected, so the markets had already factored the cut into their calculations. In other words, it was so widely anticipated that borrowing costs had already been adjusted accordingly.",
      "However, the Bank of England also said that future interest rate cuts may not come as often and as quickly as previously thought.",
      "In the words of one mortgage broker, that was because the Budget delivered by Chancellor Rachel Reeves \"threw a spanner in the works\". Spending pledges risked inflating some prices, something high interest rates are designed to control.",
      "Bank governor Andrew Bailey said rates were likely to \"continue to fall gradually from here\u201d, but cautioned they could not be cut \"too quickly or by too much\u201d.",
      "Lenders price their mortgages not only on where interest rates are at any one time but where they, and the financial markets, expect them to be in the future.",
      "Brokers say the outlook had changed for lenders given the Bank's latest view on interest rates, prompting the most recent mortgage rate moves.",
      "\u201cThe slew of rate changes in recent weeks has continued to push [mortgage] rates higher, reflecting the higher costs for lenders, as the market outlook for rates has edged toward a \u2018higher for longer\u2019 expectation,\" said David Hollingworth, from mortgage broker L&C.",
      "\"Unwelcome as it is for borrowers, it\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s no sign of rates skyrocketing as they have in recent years. The Bank of England base rate is still expected to fall over time, but markets are questioning if the pace will be as rapid.\"",
      "A Treasury spokesman said that the Budget was \"putting the public finances on a sustainable path\" and that was \"essential to ensuring steady mortgage rates for all homeowners\".",
      "What goes up might come down",
      "The general trend of interest rates is expected to be down, but timing can be tough for borrowers.",
      "That is made harder because mortgage deals currently have a relatively short shelf-life, owing to the uncertainty.",
      "\"Any stand out best-buy deals are not lasting very long,\" said Aaron Strutt, from broker Trinity Financial.",
      "\"If your mortgage is due for renewal and you are sticking with your existing lender, you need to keep an eye on the rates because the lenders don\u2019t tend to tell borrowers when they are going up.\"",

    "summary": "Lawyers and campaigners have made their arguments before Lord Ericht in Edinburgh this week.",
    "story": [
      "How much oil - and how much profit - remain beneath the waters that buffet the British Isles?",
      "Going by the number of lawyers packed into the Court of Session in Edinburgh this week, it must be a decent amount.",
      "Seven advocates squeezed into the front row of courtroom number one where environmental campaigners are challenging the government's approval of the Rosebank and Jackdaw fields.",
      "Behind them, a further three rows were also packed with lawyers, tapping on laptops and scribbling in notebooks. Such an army obviously does not come cheap.",
      "Remarkably they all agree on one basic fact - the Rosebank oil field in the Atlantic and the Jackdaw gas development in the North Sea were approved unlawfully.",
      "However, the lawyers disagree sharply about what, if anything, should be done about it.",
      "Jackdaw gas field given go-ahead by regulators",
      "Rosebank oil field given go-ahead by regulators",
      "The person who must decide is Andrew Stewart, better known by his judicial title, Lord Ericht, who is presiding over this judicial review of the UK government's decisions to approve the fields.",
      "The previous Conservative administration and the oil and gas regulator consented to Jackdaw in summer 2022, with its owner Shell saying the field would be able to provide gas to 1.4 million British homes.",
      "Rosebank, located west of Shetland and estimated to contain between 300 and 500 million barrels of oil, was given the green light the following autumn.",
      "Operated by Norwegian state energy giant Equinor and Aberdeen-based Ithaca Energy, it is believed to be the largest untapped field in UK waters and its oil is to be taken off by tanker and sold on the international market, with some gas being piped to Shetland.",
      "Among many other requirements, consent was granted on the basis of environmental impact statements submitted by the companies.",
      "As was standard practice at the time, these assessed the climate impact of emissions caused by the process of extracting oil and gas but did not assess the impact of the greenhouse gases which would be released when the fossil fuels were eventually burned, known as downstream emissions.",
      "Consent in hand, the owners of the fields raced ahead with work to get ready for drilling, striking deals with suppliers and hiring staff.",
      "All week the court has heard repeated references to the vast sums of money that are being spent on the two projects.",
      "Counsel for Equinor said it was investing \u00a32.2bn in Rosebank, providing employment for 4,000 people.",
      "Shell's lawyer said it was investing \u00a31.1bn in the Jackdaw gas field in the North Sea, employing \"at least 1,000\" people between 2023 and 2025.",
      "Production is scheduled to begin at Jackdaw in 2026 and at Rosebank in 2026/27.",
      "But this June a victory for climate campaigners in the UK Supreme Court sent a shiver through all three firms and the wider industry.",
      "In Finch v Surrey County Council, which involved a dispute about drilling oil wells near London's Gatwick Airport, the court ruled that an environmental impact assessment must include downstream emissions.",
      "'Simply lost a bet'",
      "On the eve of the judicial review, Sarah Finch, the environmental campaigner after whom the Surrey case is named, told me that \"the exact same thing happened at Rosebank.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was granted permission with no assessment of the impact of burning the oil or gas to come out of it,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cSo, a much bigger site, but exactly the same argument.\"",
      "The three companies involved in the Court of Session accept the Finch ruling means that, in retrospect, their licences were granted unlawfully.",
      "However, they insist they provided all the environmental information required at the time of their applications; they were told by the industry regulator not to assess downstream emissions; and they should not be \"punished\" for a Supreme Court decision which they say they could not have foreseen.",
      "Lord Ericht appeared to sum up their position succinctly on Friday, when he suggested it amounted to them asking him to say: \"I accept this decision is unlawful but I give it lawful effect.\"",
      "The campaign groups Greenpeace and Uplift strongly object to any such idea.",
      "They disagree that the decision in Finch could not have been predicted  with one lawyer suggesting the oil companies had simply lost a bet.",
      "Both groups now want the judge to pause work on Rosebank and Jackdaw while the fields' downstream emissions are assessed.",
      "Then, they argue, the Energy Secretary, Ed Miliband, and the government's North Sea Transition Authority (formerly known as the Oil and Gas Authority), could make a fresh decision about the fields\u2019 licences, armed with a fuller understanding of their contribution to climate change.",
      "Even then, there may be a snag. Lawyers for the government, who were also in court, say that in certain circumstances they have doubts that Mr Miliband would have the necessary legal power to revisit the decisions at all.",
      "If Mr Miliband does have the power, and if it does come to the crunch, it is not clear what he would do. In court, the UK government's lawyer was reluctant to be drawn on the matter.",
      "At times he sounded as if ministers very much wished the whole affair would simply go away.",
      "After all, in campaigning against the Tories in the general election this summer, Labour had carefully crafted a policy which appeared designed to minimise controversy, and to avoid becoming dragged into the debate about Rosebank.",
      "It went like this - Labour was committed to tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also recognised the importance of the oil and gas industry.",
      "As such it would not grant any new exploration licences in UK waters but it would allow existing projects - including Rosebank and Jackdaw - to continue.",
      "Ministers spoke of domestic energy production as critical for keeping bills down; helping to ensure the nation's energy security; generating taxes; and for assisting with the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy.",
      "Many of those claims are contested by environmentalists.",
      "Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, said 80% of the UK's oil was exported.",
      "\"There's no world in which you could have a robust environmental assessment that takes into account those downstream emissions and decide that those environmental impacts are acceptable,\" she told me.",
      "In Aberdeen though, the heart of the UK's energy industry, there is a great deal of nervousness about the potential impact of the decision in this case, and about the wider impact of government policy on the sector.",
      "Just last week, one US oil firm said it would end all North Sea operations by the end of 2029 because of high levels of taxation.",
      "Now, the eyes of climate campaigners, politicians, and oil companies alike are on Lord Ericht.",
      "Perhaps he will find a compromise, for example by allowing the oil firms to proceed with preparatory works - as long as they don\u2019t extract any oil and gas - while at the same time requiring them to provide the government with information on downstream emissions to enable them to revisit the decision.",
      "The companies\u2019 lawyers bridled at the suggestion that they were in the business of gambling but, in such a case, maybe they would have little choice but to bet that the politics of pulling the plug would be too painful for Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s government.",
      "Late on Friday afternoon, the judge retired to consider his decision, a process which could take several weeks or even months.",
      "Thanking the many lawyers for their \"excellent contributions,\" he concluded the hearing by saying: \"It's a very difficult matter and it's a very important matter,\" adding, \"I shall issue my judgment in due course.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 16:37:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Bluesky is picking up one million new users every day at its current rate.",
    "story": [
      "You may have seen the word \"Bluesky\" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.",
      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

      "As the world waits to see how the return of Donald Trump will reshape relations between Washington and Beijing, China has just taken decisive action to entrench its position in Latin America.",
      "Trump won the US presidential election on a platform that promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. Further south, though, a new China-backed megaport has the potential to create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
      "President Xi Jinping himself attended the inauguration of the Chancay port on the Peruvian coast this week, an indication of just how seriously China takes the development.",
      "Xi was in Peru for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec). But all eyes were on Chancay and what it says about China's growing assertiveness in a region that the US has traditionally seen as its sphere of influence.",
      "As seasoned observers see it, Washington is now paying the price for years of indifference towards its neighbours and their needs.",
      "\"The US has been absent from Latin America for so long, and China has moved in so rapidly, that things have really reconfigured in the past decade,\" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
      "\"You have got the backyard of America engaging directly with China,\" she tells the BBC. \"That's going to be problematic.\"",
      "Even before it opened, the $3.5bn (\u00a32.75bn) project, masterminded by China's state-owned Cosco Shipping, had already turned a once-sleepy Peruvian fishing town into a logistical powerhouse set to transform the country's economy.",
      "China's official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, called it \"a vindication of China-Peru win-win co-operation\".",
      "Peru's President Dina Boluarte was similarly enthusiastic, describing the megaport as a \"nerve centre\" that would provide \"a point of connection to access the gigantic Asian market\".",
      "But the implications go far beyond the fortunes of one small Andean nation. Once Chancay is fully up and running, goods from Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and even Brazil are expected to pass through it on their way to Shanghai and other Asian ports.",
      "China already has considerable appetite for the region's exports, including Brazilian soybeans and Chilean copper. Now this new port will be able to handle larger ships, as well as cutting shipping times from 35 to 23 days.",
      "However, the new port will favour imports as well as exports. As signs grow that an influx of cheap Chinese goods bought online may be undermining domestic industry, Chile and Brazil have scrapped tax exemptions for individual customers on low-value foreign purchases.",
      "As nervous US military hawks have pointed out, if Chancay can accommodate ultra-large container vessels, it can also handle Chinese warships.",
      "The most strident warnings have come from Gen Laura Richardson, who has just retired as chief of US Southern Command, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.",
      "She has accused China of \"playing the \u2018long game\u2019 with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region\", adding that those sites could serve as \"points of future multi-domain access for the [People's Liberation Army] and strategic naval chokepoints\".",
      "Even if that prospect never materialises, there is a strong perception that the US is losing ground in Latin America as China forges ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",
      "Outgoing US President Joe Biden was among the leaders at the Apec summit, on his first and last visit to South America during his four-year term. Media commentators remarked that he cut a diminished figure next to China's Xi.",
      "Prof \u00c1lvaro M\u00e9ndez, director of the Global South Unit at the London School of Economics, points out that while the US was taking Latin America for granted, Xi was visiting the region regularly and cultivating good relations.",
      "\"The bar has been set so low by the US that China only has to be a little bit better to get through the door,\" he says.",
      "Of course, Latin America is not the only part of the world targeted by the BRI. Since 2023, China's unprecedented infrastructure splurge has pumped money into nearly 150 countries worldwide.",
      "The results have not always been beneficial, with many projects left unfinished, while many developing countries that signed up for Beijing's largesse have found themselves burdened with debt as a result.",
      "Even so, left-wing and right-wing governments alike have cast aside their initial suspicions of China, because \"their interests are aligned\" with those of Beijing, says the Peterson Institute's Ms de Bolle: \"They have lowered their guard out of sheer necessity.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says the US is right to feel threatened by this turn of events, since Beijing has now established \"a very strong foothold\" in the region at a time when president-elect Trump wants to \"rein in\" China.",
      "\"I think we will finally start to see the US putting pressure on Latin America because of China,\" she says, adding that most countries want to stay on the right side of both big powers.",
      "\"The region doesn't have to choose unless it's put in a position where they are forced to, and that would be very dumb.\"",
      "Looking ahead, South American countries such as Peru, Chile and Colombia would be vulnerable to pressure because of the bilateral free trade agreements they have with the US, which Trump could seek to renegotiate or even tear up.",

      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 00:09:24 GMT",
    "summary": "With its rich resources, uranium mining companies want Canada to play a key role in fuelling nuclear reactors worldwide.",
    "story": [
      "Uranium is making a comeback thanks to a renewed focus on nuclear energy as a climate crisis solution. Canada, rich with high-grade deposits, could become a nuclear \u201csuperpower\u201d. But can its potential be realised?",
      "Leigh Curyer had been working in uranium mining for nearly two decades when he noticed a striking shift.",
      "In 2011, the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster in Japan badly damaged the world's view of nuclear power, and the price for the heavy metal - a critical component for nuclear fuel - cratered.",
      "But the last five years has seen a reversal, with the global price of uranium spiking by more than 200%, becoming one of this year's top-performing commodities.",
      "Mr Curyer, an Australian-born businessman, credits this to a changing attitude that began soon after Microsoft founder Bill Gates touted nuclear energy as \u201cideal for dealing with climate change\u201d in 2018.",
      "Four years later, then-UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pushed forward a policy of generating at least 25% of the country\u2019s energy from nuclear.",
      "Shortly after, the European Union voted to declare nuclear energy climate-friendly.",
      "These events were \u201ccatalytic\u201d for the uranium industry and a turning point for Mr Curyer's company NexGen, which is behind the largest in-development uranium mine in Canada.",
      "His phone began to ring with calls from investors worldwide - something that \u201chad never happened in my previous 17 years in the industry\u201d, he said.",
      "NexGen, whose project is located in Canada's remote, uranium-rich Athabasca Basin in northern Saskatchewan, is now worth nearly $4bn (\u00a32.98bn), despite the fact that the mine won\u2019t be commercially operational until at least 2028.",
      "If fully cleared by regulators, NexGen\u2019s project alone could push Canada to become the world\u2019s largest producer of uranium over the coming decade, knocking Kazakhstan out of the number one spot.",
      "Other companies have also rushed to Saskatchewan to capitalise on the boom, starting their own exploration projects in the region, while existing players re-opened dormant mines.",
      "With its rich resources, Canada\u2019s mining companies see the country playing a major role in the future of nuclear energy, meeting a demand for uranium that is poised to rise after nearly two dozen countries committed in COP28 climate conference to tripling their nuclear energy output by 2050.",
      "Nuclear energy is often hailed for its low carbon emissions compared to other sources like natural gas or coal.",
      "The World Nuclear Association estimates that 10% of power generated worldwide comes from nuclear sources, while more than 50% is still generated by gas or coal.",
      "At this year's COP29, the focus has been on ramping up funding for nuclear projects in the wake of a recent UN report indicating that current policies and investments fall short of what is needed to slow global temperature rise.",
      "Canada\u2019s role in supplying the commodity is made more urgent by Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, particularly for the US, which had relied heavily on Russian-supplied enriched uranium to fire up its commercial nuclear reactors.",
      "Mr Curyer believes his mine could prove to be \u201cabsolutely critical\u201d to America\u2019s nuclear energy future, as the US is now hunting for alternatives to Russia, including by ramping up exploration on its own soil.",
      "Uranium can be found around the world, though it is heavily present in Canada, Australia and Kazakhstan.",
      "But what makes Canada\u2019s Athabasca Region unique is that its uranium is especially high grade, said Markus Piro, a professor of nuclear engineering at McMaster University.",
      "Canada has set strict rules for the sale of its uranium to other countries, Prof Piro said, and mandates it only be used for nuclear power generation.",
      "The country is also referred to as a \u201ctier-one nuclear nation\u201d, he said, due to its capability to produce nuclear fuel from the mining to the manufacturing stage.",
      "Once mined, uranium is milled to produce what is called calcined yellowcake. It can then be enriched, if needed, at facilities overseas to create fuel for nuclear reactors.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a one-stop shop here in Canada, not every nation\u2019s like that,\u201d Prof Piro said.",
      "Canada is currently the world\u2019s second largest producer of uranium, accounting for roughly 13% of the total global output, according to the Canadian government. NexGen anticipates that once its mine is operational, it will boost that to 25%.",
      "Meanwhile, Cameco, which has been mining uranium in Saskatchewan since 1988 that supplies 30 nuclear reactors around the world, re-opened two of its mines in late 2022 to increase output.",
      "CEO Tim Gitzel told the BBC that he believes \u201cCanada could be a nuclear superpower around the world\u201d.",
      "But enthusiasm around nuclear energy is not without its critics.",
      "Some environmental groups worry nuclear projects are too costly and come with timelines that do not meet the urgency of the climate crisis.",
      "Data from the UK-based World Nuclear Association shows that 65 nuclear reactors are under construction across 16 countries, most of them in China, and a further 90 are in the planning stages.",
      "Some are expected to come online this year - others won\u2019t be ready until at least the end of the decade.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 100 nuclear plants have been closed in the last two decades around the world, including the sole nuclear power plant near New York City, which was retired in 2021 due to high operating costs and environmental and safety concerns.",
      "Plants were also shuttered in Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Quebec, Canada.",
      "And not all of Canada is on board with the country\u2019s uranium industry.",
      "British Columbia sits on its own supply of uranium but has not allowed any nuclear plants or uranium mines to operate in the province since 1980.",
      "Critics have also expressed concern about radioactive waste nuclear reactors leave behind for future generations.",
      "Others fear another Fukushima-scale disaster, where a tsunami disabled three reactors, causing the release of highly radioactive materials and forcing mass evacuations.",
      "\u201cThe risk is not zero, that is for sure\u201d though it can be reduced, said Prof Piro.",
      "\u201cEven though amongst the general public there are mixed feelings about it, the reality is that it has produced very safe, very reliable and affordable electricity worldwide.\u201d",
      "The industry maintains the technology is both promising and viable.",
      "Mr Gitzel of Cameco said the industry has learned from past safety errors.",
      "\u201cAnd the public is buying on,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that we have in Canada great public support for nuclear power.\u201d",
      "A 2023 Ipsos poll indicates that 55% of Canadians support nuclear energy.",
      "Still, past uranium booms in Canada have turned into dramatic busts.",
      "North of NexGen\u2019s proposed mine stands Uranium City, once home to 2,500 residents in its mid-20th Century heyday. In 1982, a major local mining firm shuttered operations over high costs and a soft market for uranium.",
      "Now, Uranium City\u2019s population is 91 people.",
      "But investors argue that there is a true global burgeoning demand for the commodity that poses a golden opportunity for Canada.",
      "NexGen anticipates that construction on its mine - which is awaiting clearance from Canada\u2019s federal nuclear regulator - will begin early next year.",
      "Mr Gitzel says around 100 other companies are now actively exploring Saskatchewan for deposits.",
      "As to when it will be on the market remains unclear.",
      "Mr Gitzel cautioned that some companies have started explorations in the past that never reached production stage. The timeline to get mining projects approved in Canada can also be lengthy.",
      "\u201cBuilding a mine is going to take five to 10 years, and so far, the only ones in operation are ours, so we will wait and see how it plays out,\u201d he said.",
      "For Mr Curyer, it is crucial that his project and others are realised in the next four years, for both Canada and the world.",

      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",
      "The government will set out legislation in Parliament on Monday that will require major care home providers to share their finances with the government, so it can challenge what it describes as profiteering.",
      "This will also include a \"backstop\" law that would place a limit on those profits, which the government can put into effect if the companies do not do so voluntarily.",
      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",
      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",
      "The government says it is acting on the recommendation of a child safeguarding panel, which reviewed allegations of abuse at three children's homes in Doncaster run by the Hesley Group.",
      "In 2023, the BBC revealed that more than 100 reports concerning abuse and neglect were logged at the sites between 2018 and 2021. Children were allegedly beaten, locked outside naked in the cold and had vinegar poured on cuts.",

    "summary": "More than three quarters of universities are expected to face financial problems next year.",
    "story": [
      "Almost three quarters of universities in England will face financial problems next year - despite tuition fees increasing, the BBC has been told.",
      "A report published on Friday reveals how financial issues faced by most universities are even worse than previously thought. The Office for Students (OfS) predicts more than a third are likely to have serious cash flow problems.",
      "Speaking exclusively to the BBC, Sir David Behan, the regulator\u2019s chairman, called for radical change, saying course closures and university mergers might be needed for financial stability.",
      "The government is considering the long-term funding and reform of universities.",
      "Tuition fees in England will rise for current and existing students by \u00a3285 to \u00a39,535 a year for those on full-time degrees, in autumn 2025.",
      "Even so, new analysis by the OfS, the independent regulator of higher education in England, shows a worsening position for universities.",
      "The regulator had said it expected 40% of universities to be in financial deficit in 2023-24.",
      "Now the OfS says by 2025-26, 72% could be spending more money than they have coming in and may have to use an overdraft or financial reserves, with a total \u00a31.6bn deficit forecast across the sector.",
      "In 40% of institutions, cash flow may become so tight there will only be enough money in the bank to cover one month at a time of bills including salaries.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said the OfS findings show \"why universities must do more to make their finances work\".",
      "Radically reimagined",
      "Sir David Behan, the OfS chairman, says a university going bust \u201cisn\u2019t imminent now\u201d, but to reduce the risk higher education needs to be \u201cradically reimagined\u201d.",
      "He suggests universities should think about \u201ca transformation of their offer\u201d, looking closely at the length and range of courses, and how to increase degree apprenticeships where tuition fees are covered mainly through the levy on larger employers.",
      "Apprentices are paid to work while they study, so students end up with less debt.",
      "Sir David says universities also need to collaborate more, and should consider mergers or whether courses at nearby institutions are too similar - saying it \"doesn't make sense\" for those universities to compete with one another.",
      "But, he says, as some universities reduce the number of courses on offer he doesn\u2019t want to see \u201ccold spots\u201d where students in more rural locations don\u2019t have a choice of courses at their nearest university.",
      "Why tuition fees are set to rise - and what this means for students",
      "'My 12 hours of uni each week are incredible value'",
      "Why are university tuition fees going up?",
      "The outlook has worsened for universities because they have recruited fewer UK and international students than predicted.",
      "For home students, the OfS says, Ucas figures suggest numbers have increased by around 1.3% this year, compared with the optimistic 5.8% universities had predicted.",
      "Universities that traditionally required higher entry grades have fared better, because they have simply taken a bigger share by accepting some students with lower results.",
      "This has led to lower recruitment and increased pressure in universities that accept middling grades, and some smaller institutions.",
      "International recruitment has also fallen, with overall visa applications down by about 16% this year, and 20% fewer applications from India alone.",
      "Since January, most international students have been banned from bringing family members to live with them in the UK.",
      "The rule was introduced last year by Rishi Sunak's government, which committed to bringing immigration numbers down.",
      "Difficult decisions",
      "All of this comes as the government considers what to do about university funding in England from 2026, in a review likely to conclude next year.",
      "The OfS report acknowledges that the scale of change needed will not be easy.",
      "Vivienne Stern, chief executive of Universities UK, which represents 140 institutions, says universities are already \"making tough choices to control costs\", adding that the sector \"needs to continue evolving\".",
      "She says the size of the challenge \"is a source of serious concern\".",
      "The University of East Anglia (UEA) in Norwich has cut \u00a330m in the last 18 months - almost 10% of its annual spending.",
      "Prof David Maguire, the vice chancellor, says \u201cdifficult decisions\u201d have led to a 20% reduction in the number of courses, increased lecture group sizes, less one-to-one contact between academics and students, and fewer staff in student support including in mental health and counselling.",
      "Unlike big city universities, there are no nearby institutions to collaborate with, so remaining financially sustainable is crucial, especially for the many local students who live at home.",
      "Prof Maguire says universities need to know what tuition fees or direct funding they will get through to the next election.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want boom and bust, where one year we\u2019re up, the next year we\u2019re down,\" he says.",
      "\"That doesn\u2019t help anybody.\u201d",
      "The increase in National Insurance contributions the university has to pay as an employer will more than wipe out the increase in tuition fees next year, he adds.",
      "As universities cut back there is a risk to the student experience - this year the largest annual study of undergraduates found only 36% in England thought their course was good or very good value for money.",
      "Sir David says he expects \u201cabsolute transparency\u201d about what students are getting in return for fees, whether on contact hours or important services such as mental health support.",
      "He suggests business degrees are one area that might need more scrutiny to demonstrate which offer the best outcomes for students.",
      "Teddy Darvill-Cutts is a UEA occupational therapy student who says he can see where his tuition fee goes.",
      "\u201cI'm surrounded by all this up-to-date technology, everything's working well,\u201d he says.",
      "But another UEA student, Amber Bramham, says not \u201call students see the benefits equally\u201d.",
      "The financial pressures on universities could lead to very visible changes such as institutions focusing on a smaller number of courses to which they can recruit well.",
      "The forecasts published on Friday will also form part of the public debate, and private negotiations between universities and ministers considering whether tuition fees should rise further in the future.",
      "The heat is now on universities to bring down costs, with renewed scrutiny from ministers and the regulator over how they spend money.",
      "This could renew pressure around vice chancellors pay, even though it is a tiny fraction of the spending of universities with a turnover of \u00a3500m or more."

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses in his upcoming sex trafficking trial, prosecutors have alleged.",
      "The music mogul is accused of making \"relentless efforts\" to \"corruptly influence witness testimony\", by using other inmates' telephone accounts, and using three-way calls to speak to people who are not on his approved contacts list.",
      "Prosecutors said a review of recorded calls also found that Mr Combs instructed his family to contact potential witnesses in his case, they said in a court filing.",
      "Mr Combs, 55, is currently in custody in Manhattan. He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges against him and strenuously denied any wrongdoing.",
      "Best known for 1990s hits such as I'll Be Missing You and Mo' Money, Mo' Problems, the musician has been denied bail since his arrest, with multiple judges citing a risk that he might tamper with witnesses.",
      "His lawyers made a renewed bid for bail last week, proposing a $50m (\u00a339.6m) package that would see Mr Combs be monitored around the clock by security personnel, while under house arrest.",
      "Lawyer Alexandra Shapiro argued it was impossible for the musician to prepare for trial from behind bars because of the \"incredibly voluminous\" amount of material to review, especially without a laptop computer.",
      "She also said his preparation has been hampered by conditions at the jail, including frequent lockdowns and officers taking away the pens he uses to take notes.",
      "Detention is stripping Mr Combs of \"any real opportunity\" to be ready for trial, violating his rights under the US Constitution, Shapiro said.",
      "In response, prosecutors argued that the request for bail should be denied, alleging that Mr Combs \"poses serious risks of danger and obstruction of these proceedings\".",
      "In court documents, they accused the star of orchestrating social media posts in order to \"influence a potential jury pool\" at his trial.",
      "Amongst those efforts, they cited an Instagram statement posted by a woman known only as \"witness two\", countering allegations made by singer Dawn Richard in a civil lawsuit against Mr Combs.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that her statement was drafted with Mr Combs during \"multiple texts\" and \"multiple calls\" from prison.",
      "They further alleged there was a \"strong inference\" that Mr Combs \"paid witness two, after she posted her statement\".",
      "The charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs explainedThe parties that led to Diddy's downfallDiddy's trial: When does it start, and what happens next?Diddy assault video cements the downfall of a hip-hop iconChaos reigns - the notorious jail where Diddy is being held",

      "Diddy assault video cements the downfall of a hip-hop icon",
      "Chaos reigns - the notorious jail where Diddy is being held",
      "A video posted by the star's seven children on 5 November was also cited as evidence of a \"public relations strategy to influence this case\".",
      "The video, which was reported by multiple media outlets, showed the family wishing Mr Combs a happy birthday during a prison phone call.",
      "\"The defendant then monitored the analytics - ie audience engagement - and explicitly discussed with his family how to ensure that the video had his desired effect on potential jury members in this case,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Mr Combs was also accused of using the phone accounts of at least eight other inmates to make calls, which is against prison regulations; and of \"directing others\" to orchestrate payment for this access.",
      "Prosecutors characterised Mr Combs as running a \"relentless\" scheme to \"contact potential witnesses, including victims of his abuse who could provide powerful testimony against him\".",
      "'Uncanny ability'",
      "Urging the judge to deny Mr Combs' request for bail, the prosecutors wrote that \"no set of conditions\" could eliminate the potential risks to the trial.",
      "\"The defendant has demonstrated an uncanny ability to get others to do his bidding - employees, family members, and [prison] inmates alike,\" they claimed.",
      "\"There is no reason to believe that private security personnel would be immune.\"",
      "Prosecutors also rejected criticism of the conditions at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, citing an interview from the star's lawyer Marc Agnifilo, who said \"food\u2019s probably the roughest part\" of Mr Combs' adjustment to life behind bars.",
      "The musician's lawyers have yet to react to the court motion. The BBC has contacted his legal team for a response.",
      "Mr Combs' legal troubles began last November, when his ex-partner Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura filed a civil lawsuit, alleging incidents of rape and physical assault between 2007 and 2018.",
      "Although the case was quickly settled out of court, it led to a flurry of similar accusations and an investigation by the US Government.",
      "The star's properties were raided by federal agents in March, and he was arrested in New York in September.",
      "Mr Combs was charged with three counts of sex trafficking and racketeering, in a federal indictment that described allegations of drug-fuelled, days-long sexual performances dubbed as \"Freak Offs\".",
      "The musician is simultaneously facing more than two dozen civil cases by men and women accusing him of sexual assault, rape and sexual exploitation.",
      "The star has vehemently denied all of the charges against him, and the claims in the civil suits, arguing that the sexual encounters at the heart of his criminal case were all consensual.",
      "New lawsuit filed against lawyer",
      "In a separate development on Monday, a lawsuit was filed against one of the lawyers known for spearheading more than 120 lawsuits against Mr Combs.",
      "The lawsuit, filed by an unnamed \"high-profile individual\" against Texas attorney Tony Buzbee, alleged that Mr Buzbee attempted to extort him by threatening to make public \u201centirely fabricated and malicious allegations of sexual assault\".",
      "In court documents obtained by the BBC, the plaintiff identified himself as a former associate of Diddy and acknowledged attending events with the embattled music mogul.",
      "The lawsuit against Mr Buzbee claims the Houston attorney follows a \"clear playbook\" for extorting celebrities involving fabricating allegations and demanding letters seeking payment.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that if the demands are not met, he turns to the media to apply public pressure.",
      "Mr Buzbee, who denies wrongdoing, described the filing as a \u201clast-ditch attempt\u201d to stop him from naming the individual.",
      "\u201cIt is obvious that the frivolous lawsuit filed against my firm is an aggressive attempt to intimidate or silence me and ultimately my clients,\u201d he said in a statement posted to Instagram.",
      "\"No amount of money was included in the demand letters,\" he wrote. \"No threats were made. The demand letters sent are no different than the ones routinely sent by lawyers across the country in all types of cases.\u201d",

      "Musical inspiration can strike any time and anywhere.",
      "Few rock frontmen, though, would have been open to receiving it while in a car listening to a news report about the theft of a giant model gorilla from a Scottish garden centre.",
      "Tom Ogden wrote an indie-pop anthem about the incident, then dedicated their fifth album to the unfortunate inanimate ape.",

      "To Blossoms, Gary has now become muse and mascot, spirit animal and unofficial sixth member of the band.",
      "Both the song and the replica of Gary that the group have taken on tour are fan favourites.",
      "Some would also call it a gimmick, which is partly true, except that not even Ogden could seriously have calculated that the song and the story behind it would really catch on.",
      "\"It has connected with people,\" the singer says. \"I didn't anticipate it, but I knew I wanted to have something that made people go, what's that?",
      "\"Even if people think it is ludicrous, it's an entry point. And people were just ready for a bit of fun, I suppose.",

      "\"We love doing a cover, and we thought we'd cover songs we loved growing up. I always loved I Wanna Dance With Somebody. It's as simple as that,\" Ogden says.",
      "And in recent years, they have joined forces with 1980s star Rick Astley to tour as a The Smiths tribute band.",
      "Blossoms' love of 80s pop was noted in a review in The Times of the Gary album, which declared the track I Like Your Look was \"Wham!-like\".",
      "\"I took that as a huge compliment, because I love Wham!\" Ogden says.",

      "\"I think if you call an album Gary, and you write a song about a fibreglass gorilla, you're out in the open, in terms of someone's going to say something like that,\" the singer responds.",
      "\"But I think there is depth on the album, of course, because there are songs like Mothers, which is about friendship and growing up. And then Why Do I Give You The Worst Of Me? is a very personal song.",
      "\"So I think someone's just thought, yeah, there's a song about fibreglass gorilla, maybe that's a bit of fun. And I Like Your Look\u2019s not taking itself too seriously either.",
      "\"And do you know what, you can\u2019t please everybody so... I don't really care, to be honest.",

      "BBC News has approached Martin-Smith for a comment.",
      "In the documentary, Martin-Smith said Williams had made him out to be \"evil\" and had blamed him for some of his behaviour, including his drug-taking.",
      "Responding specifically to that point, Williams told his former manager: \u201cAllow me to respond to your assertion. My drug taking was never your fault.",
      "\"My response to the warped world that surrounded me is solely my own. How I chose to self-medicate is and was something that I will be monitoring and dealing with for the whole of my life.",

      "Williams, who has since forged a successful solo career, also used his post to speak more generally about the pressures of being in a boyband.",
      "\"Nearly all members of boybands it seems have at some point a mental breakdown,\" he said.",
      "\"Your young charge at this time in his life was experiencing his first. You didn't excel in man management and it was here that, instead of a stern word and a pointed finger, an arm around the shoulder and a kind word would have been the best tact.\"",
      "He added: \u201cIf you are following the story closely, you can\u2019t help but notice a pattern emerge. Boys join a boyband. The band becomes huge. Boys get sick.",
      "\"Some are fortunate through a series of self-examinations and help to overcome their experience. Some never quite manage to untangle the mess of the wreckage of the past.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not breaking anyone\u2019s anonymity by sharing the side effects of boyband dysphoria that relate to just us lads.\"",
      "He outlined the struggles his bandmates have had in the past, including Gary Barlow's battles with an eating disorder and Mark Owen's struggles with alcohol abuse.",
      "Returning to his former manager, he told him he had \"deep admiration\" for his work and his ability to take big risks.",
      "But he added: \u201cNige, you continue to not come across as a relatable character and could do with a glow-up where redeemable features are concerned. Therefore you play into the narrative you don\u2019t want for yourself.\u201d",
      "He went on to urge Martin-Smith to take accountability and to \"admit your shortcomings\".",
      "The documentary, which reaches its conclusion this week, focuses on some of the biggest boybands to grace the charts during the 1990s and early 2000s."

    "story": [
      "The Duke of Sussex is \"one of two claimants\" continuing claims against the publisher of The Sun over allegations of unlawful information gathering, his barrister told the High Court.",
      "Former Labour deputy leader Tom Watson is also continuing his claim against News Group Newspapers (NGN), the court heard on Friday, after 39 cases were settled since a previous hearing in July.",
      "Both cases are expected to go to trial in January 2025, with the 40-year-old prince alleging  journalists and private investigators working for NGN - which also published the now defunct News of the World - targeted him.",
      "NGN has previously denied unlawful activity happened at The Sun.",
      "Both sides returned to court to ask a judge to rule on preliminary issues ahead of the 2025 trial - including whether Prince Harry could be allowed access to emails sent between former NGN executives and members of the Royal Household between 2013 and 2019.",
      "His barrister, David Sherborne, said the emails were sent between five accounts of NGN employees and five employees of the Royal Household, who were \"involved in Royal Communications and the private secretaries to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II\".",
      "Mr Sherborne said the emails would be \"highly relevant in terms of providing the full picture not only as to the actual knowledge of the claimant but also as to the position in relation to constructive knowledge, based on what the Palace was being told by NGN\".",
      "Some of the emails had already been provided by former News UK chief executive Rebekah Brooks last year, the court heard, but Mr Sherborne said that these had been \"cherry-picked\".",
      "These included discussions between NGN and the Royal Household before Harry began legal action in 2019, and conversations about a possible apology being made by the publisher.",
      "Anthony Hudson KC, for NGN, opposed the bid, saying the emails were \"not relevant to the pleaded issues\" in the prince's case and were \"not necessary to ensure a fair trial will take place\".",
      "He added that \"extracting\" the emails would cost \u00a317,000.",
      "In a ruling, Mr Justice Fancourt said there was a \"degree of speculation whether any of the documents sought are going to assist the claimant's case\", but ultimately ruled there was \"sufficient justification\" for a limited number of emails to be provided.",
      "He said: \"In all the circumstances, therefore, it seems to me that there is a limited category of documents where despite the element of delay, and despite the relative lateness of the application, there is a credible case for saying a full picture is necessary in the interest of justice.",
      "\"I will, however, limit the documents that are being sought,\" the judge added.",
      "The judge also added it was \"unsatisfactory that so little progress has been made\" and that there needs to be \"further work done on both sides\".",
      "The court heard the trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks, and a further hearing is due to be held in December.",
      "Others who have settled their claims in recent years include actress Sienna Miller, ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne, and actor Hugh Grant.",
      "Grant previously claimed journalists had used private investigators to tap his phone and burgle his house - NGN denied the claims against it. He said in April that he \"did not want to accept\" the \"enormous sum of money\" he had been offered to settle but a trial was likely to prove \"very expensive\".",
      "A spokesperson for NGN said it published an apology in 2011 to \"victims of voicemail interception by the News of the World\", adding that the company had \"publicly committed to paying financial compensation\" and had since \"paid settlements to those with proper claims\".",
      "They added: \"It is common practice, and indeed encouraged in litigation, to seek to settle claims outside court where both parties agree without the cost of a trial.\""

    "title": "Silent Men film asks why so many still struggle to open up",
    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 17:59:12 GMT",
    "summary": "Scottish filmmaker Duncan Cowles set out to ask why men tend to bottle up their emotions.",
    "story": [
      "Male mental health is back in the spotlight ahead of International Men's Day on Tuesday (19 November). The subject has received much more prominence in the last decade - something many would argue is long overdue.",
      "But while the high rates of male suicide have put the topic firmly on the national agenda - huge numbers of men still find it difficult to be openly vulnerable and discuss their feelings.",
      "With suicide the biggest killer of men under 50 in the UK, a new film explores why many men still bottle up their emotions, and asks whether such ingrained, systemic behaviour can be changed.",
      "Duncan Cowles, who directs Silent Men, is the first to admit his own struggles to open up emotionally to those closest to him, joking that tackling the subject for the documentary was \"like dragging myself backwards through a hedge\".",
      "Speaking at the Sheffield Documentary Festival earlier this year, he told BBC News it was an important journey to go on because the risks of ignoring your emotions are far scarier.",
      "\"I think there's still a lot of societal pressure around those traditional masculine traits,\" Cowles says. \"Being strong and things associated with being a leader or this stable, reliable, dependable figure.",
      "\"There's maybe something still seductive about that idea of that old-fashioned man, that James Bond character that a lot of us maybe grew up with. I think it's still quite sought-after by a lot of people.",
      "\"Whereas my experience is when you're a bit more open and vulnerable, that can actually lead to stronger relationships, and therefore more joy, connection and fulfilment. And yet still we're drawn to being closed off.\"",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "If you are affected by any of the issues in this story, the BBC Action Line has information about services that can provide support and advice.",
      "The idea of men suffering in silence is nothing new. It was 1854 when Henry David Thoreau wrote: \"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation.\"",
      "The fact that the essayist's most famous observation has survived for 170 years and is still quoted so widely today is a testament to its relatability - but also of how little progress has been made.",
      "Thoreau tapped into a feeling many men have, both then and now, of being unfulfilled - whether that's in their career, relationships or for reasons they can't quite put their finger on.",
      "Overwhelmed by the commitments or mundanity of day-to-day life, while simultaneously unwilling or unable to voice their emotions, men often find it hard to cope.",
      "Blue blanket theory",
      "\"I suppose it's always been something I've struggled with, opening up and showing emotions around family,\" Cowles says of his reasons for making the film.",
      "\"While I was at university, I'd done a little film which investigated that, but it always felt like this thing that I hadn't fully resolved in my life.\"",
      "Setting out to explore the subject further at the start of the film, Cowles posts an advert online, looking for men to speak to for the documentary. He then goes to interview some of those who reply.",
      "He travels around the country and speaks to men from different walks of life over several years. At one point, he attends a retreat where men gather for a weekend to do group therapy.",
      "\"I wanted to go on my own journey, parallel to speaking to men as part of the film. But it turned into a more personal film than I expected,\" he explains.",
      "The Scottish filmmaker interviews members of his own family and studies how their personalities shaped his own. \"My dad likes drilling holes in the wall, and his stamps, but he's not big on verbal communication,\" Cowles notes early on - painting a picture of fathers many will recognise.",
      "One trauma specialist interviewed for the film cites a study which found that babies in blue blankets - and therefore assumed to be boys - were touched for significantly less time than girls.",
      "\"So that's really interesting, what are we doing in our culture about socialising boys to not be touched as much, not be seen as vulnerable, not need emotional support as much as girls?\" she asks.",
      "\"The toughening up - 'be a brave boy, big boys don't cry' - that process of making you into a man, where someone has told you that that's what a man is, that a man has got to be emotionally strong.",
      "\"There are all these social constructs that kind of trap you, which is causing huge numbers of mental health issues for guys. We've got a big problem on our hands.\"",
      "Silent Men is Cowles' first feature documentary, but he previously won a Bafta Scotland award for his short film Isabella.",
      "Asked if it was difficult to get the men featured in the film to talk about their feelings, Cowles replies: \"Strangely not, because there's something about speaking to a stranger that can sometimes feel a lot easier than speaking to someone who's in your own family. I guess it's because you've less to lose.\"",
      "The insights from other men make for interesting viewing. One contributor, Ainslie, says his outlook changed after having a baby. But not necessarily in the way you might think - he says the responsibility of being a father actually meant there was less time and opportunity to find room for expressing his own emotions.",
      "Another man, Dom, tells his young son constantly how much he loves him, and says he hated the thought of anybody close to him dying without knowing how much they meant to him.",
      "One of the film's most affecting - and funniest - moments comes when the microphone Cowles' brother is using cuts out after the battery dies, and he uses that exact moment, when he can't fully be heard, to tell Duncan: \"I love you.\"",
      "Despite all the heavy talk, the film is peppered with moments of levity - the director occasionally cuts away abruptly from tough conversations to run footage of soothing shorelines and bumble bees on flowers.",
      "\"One thing I really wanted to do with this film is make it feel accessible, not all mental health based, but [to] also contain humour and leave people with a smile on their face,\" he says.",
      "The documentary builds towards a conclusion as Cowles sits down with his parents to tell them he loves them.",
      "While both are receptive, his father is somewhat dismissive of the \"airy-fairy\" nature of showing emotions, suggesting it's \"not a normal thing for a man\".",
      "Therefore, his father argues, if somebody isn't opening up, that's actually a good sign, as not feeling the need to be vulnerable means they are generally feeling content.",
      "Reflecting on his father's comments now, Cowles says: \"He comes from a generation where he doesn't want to see someone visibly upset, so if you're showing nothing, then that's a good thing [to him] because it means you're OK. I know what he means.",
      "\"Younger people seem to have a different opinion on these kinds of things, and they are more willing to open up,\" he notes. \"There's that awareness of the issue.\"",
      "Cowles admits on camera his worry that he will pretend to have made progress for the purposes of giving the film a happy ending, when in reality there may not have been any significant change.",
      "But several months after filming wrapped, Cowles says making the film \"definitely has\" altered his behaviour.",
      "\"I wouldn't say it's a Hollywood transformation,\" he laughs. \"It's been quite a gradual thing, and I wouldn't say I'm perfect by any means.",
      "\"But compared to what I was like before, my partner is very appreciative that I've changed, that I'm more conscious of it and able to recognise when I should open up a bit more.\"",
      "Silent Men is screened at Sheffield DocFest in June and is released in UK cinemas on 19 November."

      "To a blue, black and green sequined top, complete with a golden snake necklace and bracelet.",
      "And Mbuya\u2019s personal favourite - jeans, a graphic T-shirt with her image on the front and a blonde wig.",
      "\"I had never worn jeans or a wig before - so I was happy, and I was dancing.\"",
      "Ms Kaumba, who has been a stylist since 2012, says that her grandma has \"courage, grace - and nails every look\".",
      "All the looks reflect her maximalist-chic aesthetic - which celebrates the joy of excess, eclectic combinations, the big and the bold, and clashing patterns and colours.",

      "She is smoking a pipe or holding a metal cup full of tea, and hanging off the edge of the chair arm is an \"mbaula\" or charcoal brazier that Zambians often use for cooking - especially now that the country is plagued by severe power cuts.",

      "There is something quite bold about telling people you look like someone famous - especially if your supposed doppelganger is one of the world\u2019s biggest heartthrobs.",
      "But that hasn't put off the hundreds of men in the UK and US who have taken part in a recent craze for lookalike competitions.",
      "It all started with the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet competition in New York three weeks ago, which even attracted the real actor himself.",
      "Since then, similar contests have attracted crowds of young people hoping to get a glimpse of someone who vaguely resembles Harry Styles, Dev Patel or Paul Mescal.",
      "With eternal bragging rights, five minutes of fame and (paltry) cash prizes up for grabs, the winners and organisers explain why these events have taken off.",
      "'It was a free event, why wouldn't I go?'",
      "Our fascination with celebrity lookalikes is nothing particularly new - Stars in Their Eyes, a show in which amateur lookalikes impersonate singers, ran on ITV for 16 years. The format was revived as Starstruck in 2022.",
      "But the latest competitions all have one thing in common: the celebrities are all young, attractive and male.",
      "Avani Johnson, who was at the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet contest, says she believes the latest trend has taken off because \"women are relishing the opportunity to objectify men in a complete switch in power dynamics\".",
      "She adds that it also gives us a chance \"to laugh at the absurdity of pageantry\".",
      "Miles Mitchell, a 20-year-old student, picked up the prize for the best Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet lookalike last month at the competition that set this trend alight.",
      "Miles was first told he looked like Chalamet when studying in South Korea.",
      "\"I was there at the time Dune was released, so people kept asking me in shops and restaurants if I was Timoth\u00e9e on a press tour.\"",
      "He says he was drawn to the competition because, as a university student in New York, \"socialising can be really expensive so my friends and I loved the fact this was a free and fun event\".",
      "\"It was also just something a bit different and wacky that I wanted to be part of.\"",
      "The event took social media by storm, with one person commenting on X it was \"a historic pop culture moment\", while another said the competition \"shows that the people yearn for weird town events\".",
      "Although the real Timoth\u00e9e turned up and took pictures with some of the lookalikes, Miles didn't get a chance to meet the American actor.",
      "\"He arrived at the same time the police did to shut down the event so I had already moved to the secondary location for the event. I'm gutted I didn't get to meet him.\"",
      "'I entered the contest for publicity'",
      "Oscar Journeaux, a 22-year-old musician, recently won a Harry Styles lookalike competition in central London and admits he entered \"for publicity\".",
      "\"I thought I could get a bit of fame and promo for my music and the industry is so hard to break into, you really have to get yourself out there.\"",
      "Oscar, who says he once missed his train because an insistent fan made him sign an autograph, adds: \"People want to think there's a deeper meaning to these events, but really we're all just bored millennials and Gen Z looking for something to do.\"",
      "Keenan Gregor, who entered as a blond Harry, says he went along because he \"wanted to be part of something that could go viral\".",
      "Journalist Katrina Mirpuri says she organised the lookalike contest because \"people need to have some fun after all the dreary news we're having\".",
      "Despite worrying that \"no-one would turn up\", she says half of Soho Square was packed with lookalikes and fans.",
      "Even though most of the contestants didn't quite look like Harry, \"the girls were screaming for each man as they got up to twirl, so they were doing something right\".",
      "\"Really it wasn't about who looked most like Harry,\" Katrina explains. \"It was a way for people to just be positive and celebratory about each other, which is what we need when everyone is so nasty and negative on social media.\"",
      "She has now got her eye on hosting another competition but this time \"for someone older, like Hugh Grant\".",
      "'I made new friends at the contest'",
      "Jaipreet Hundal had a pretty good weekend when he was crowned the most convincing Dev Patel lookalike in San Francisco.",
      "\"The best bit was that when I turned up, some people thought I was the real Dev Patel and they were so excited that he had come to the event,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "The 25-year-old says looking like the Slumdog Millionaire actor has \"given him a glimpse of what it's like to be a celebrity\".",
      "He explains that the trend is popular now because \"it's a great way to get people together to have a wholesome time\".",
      "Sudev Namboodiri, who drove hours to enter the competition and gets told he looks like Dev on an almost daily basis, says it \"wasn't about winning\".",
      "\"It's nice to meet new people and it was cool that hundreds of young people decided to turn up and hang out.\"",
      "After the recent all-consuming election in the US, \"people really need to disconnect from everything and have a bit of fun\", he adds.",
      "'I don't get called my real name any more'",
      "Julyus Odreman has spent a decade being mistaken for Zayn Malik, but cannot see it himself because he says he is \"nowhere near as handsome\".",
      "Julyus, from Venezuela, says his friends think he looks so much like Zayn that \"people don't even call me by my real name any more\".",
      "The resemblance to the former One Direction star means he often gets \"stopped by groups of girls on the subway or the street\".",

      "Its 2023 commercial featured a giant Venus flytrap. It left some viewers perplexed, as they questioned what a bloodthirsty plant had to do with Christmas.",

      "She falls through a rack of dresses and finds herself in a fantastical world, where she revisits moments in her life - from childhood through to teenage years and adulthood.",
      "There are no recognisable celebrities in the advert, something Charlotte Lock, customer director at John Lewis, told the BBC was deliberate.",
      "\"We get contacted every year by A-listers who want to be in our ad,\" she said.",

      "\"The cost of living is still on people's minds, and people are concerned about the cost of Christmas,\" she said.",
      "\"It feels like there's a nation that's quite exhausted and actually has been waiting to celebrate, and Christmas is a great outlet for that,\" she added.",

    "title": "Glastonbury 2025: 11 tips for getting festival tickets",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:43:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Tickets go on sale this week, so here are some tips to maximise your chances of securing entry.",
    "story": [
      "Tickets for the Glastonbury Festival go on sale this week, with millions of fans expected to fight it out for a chance to attend the event, which will run from 25-29 June 2025.",
      "No headliners have been announced yet, but demand is expected to be higher than ever because the festival will take a year off in 2026.",
      "Last year, all 210,000 tickets sold out in just 58 minutes as more than 2.5 million people tried to log on and secure a place.",
      "\"There aren't enough tickets for everybody,\" organiser Emily Eavis told the BBC's Sidetracked podcast earlier this year. \"It's one of the worst parts of the job [because] we can't do anything about it. We definitely can't do two weekends.",
      "\"But a lot of the time,\" she added, \"people who really, really want to come often get tickets through volunteering or through competitions.\"",
      "So there's always hope... But if you're brave enough to run the gauntlet of the online ticketing system, here are a few tips that might (might) help improve your chances.",
      "READ NEXT: Glastonbury 2025 tickets go on sale",
      "1) Check your registration",
      "As part of an ongoing (and successful) campaign to stop touts, anyone who wants to attend Glastonbury has to be registered in advance.",
      "The registration window closed on Monday, 11 November - so if you're not on the list already, it's too late.",
      "Everyone else is urged to check their details in advance, to make sure everything is up to date.",
      "You will need to have the registration number and postcode for each person you are buying a ticket for when the sale begins.",
      "2) Decide between coach or general entry",
      "Glastonbury tickets come in two flavours - standard weekend tickets and coach weekend tickets.",
      "Weekend tickets mean you can arrive under your own steam by train or car - although beware Glastonbury's legendary tailbacks, and how depleted your energy levels might be on the way home.",
      "Coach tickets are more environmentally friendly and, according to some, increase your chances of success, depending on how remote your starting point is. However, it's important to note that festival tickets are distributed on the coach itself, so you can't cheat the system.",
      "Ticket and coach packages will go on sale at 18:00 GMT on Thursday, 14 November.",
      "General admission tickets will go on sale at 09:00 on Sunday, 17 November.",
      "3) Team up with your friends",
      "You can purchase up to six tickets once you reach the booking stage, as long as you have the registration details for each attendee.",
      "Logically, the more people trying for tickets, the better the chances are of securing a space - so make sure all six of you are trying to log on when tickets go on sale (NB not in the same house... see below for why).",
      "Your syndicate doesn't have to be formed of people you're physically going to the festival with. It can be friends, colleagues, aunts, uncles, neighbours or Chris Martin from Coldplay. The point is that you're working together.",
      "Make a group chat so you can co-ordinate your efforts and, most importantly, put all of your registration numbers and postcodes in a shared document so the first person to reach the front of the queue is ready.",
      "4) Don't fall for scam websites",
      "The demand for Glastonbury tickets inevitably attracts scam artists and fraudsters, who prey on people's desperation to separate them from their money.",
      "Tickets are sold exclusively at glastonbury.seetickets.com. Avoid the temptation of buying from elsewhere.",
      "5) Log on early",
      "This year, Glastonbury has introduced a new queueing system that requires you to log on in advance.",
      "That way, when the ticket sale starts, you will be randomly assigned a place in the queue.",
      "People who join later will automatically be placed at the back of the line, so it pays to be punctual.",
      "Also, 09:00 on Sunday isn't the most sociable time of the week. Set an alarm. Set multiple alarms. Get an insomniac friend to come over to your house and poke you with a stick. Whatever works.",
      "If it's possible (and I apologise for this in advance), you could even drag yourself into work. No matter how good your wifi is at home, a work computer could have a more stable connection.",
      "6) Don't use multiple devices",
      "Using multiple devices and browser tabs can result in errors and may even get you kicked out of the queue, which you definitely don't want.",
      "Sticking to one device per household also makes the process more fair, according to the Glastonbury website.",
      "\"Whilst we understand that everyone wants to have the best possible chance of booking a ticket, running multiple devices simultaneously to attempt to access the website is a waste of valuable resources, and doesn\u2019t reflect the ethos of the festival.",
      "\"Please stick to one device and one tab, so that you can focus on entering your details without confusing your browser and help us make the ticket sale as quick and stress free as possible for all.\"",
      "7) Familiarise yourself with the booking process",
      "A limited number of people will be given access to the booking system at any one time. Before that, you will be held in a queue.",
      "When (or if) you get through, you will be asked to enter the registration number and postcode for the lead booker and up to five other people. Copy and paste them, instead of entering manually, to avoid errors.",
      "When you proceed, the next page will summarise the details you entered. Check them carefully because they cannot be changed.",
      "If you are booking a coach package, the next step will be to choose the time, date and place you will depart from. It is only possible to book tickets from one departure town in a single transaction.",
      "Once that's all confirmed, you will be asked to enter payment details.",
      "8) Have your payment information ready",
      "This year, Glastonbury tickets cost \u00a3375.50 each plus a \u00a35 booking fee - but at the check-out you will only pay a deposit of \u00a375, with the balance due in the first week of April. (Children aged 12 and under go free, and do not need to be registered.)",
      "Make sure you have enough money in your account (\u00a3450 if you're buying for six people) and, crucially, keep your card details to hand.",
      "When the time comes, enter these details exactly as you see them because a mistake could result in the purchase being declined. In some cases, that could leave your registration details being frozen for up to 10 minutes.",
      "Finally, make sure your phone is charged and notifications aren't silenced, in case your bank contacts you for verification.",
      "9) Check your email",
      "Once you've made the booking, be sure to check your email for confirmation - including the junk folder.",
      "If you don't receive an email within three hours, ticket-holders are urged to contact See Tickets on their customer service portal.",
      "10) Don't despair",
      "If you're not one of the lucky ones, there's still hope.",
      "It's possible to get into the festival as a volunteer - typically working three eight-hour shifts in return for a ticket.",
      "And in April, a number of returned or unwanted tickets will be put up for sale. At which point, you can go through the stress of applying all over again.",
      "11) Indulge in wild speculation about the line-up",
      "This won't help you get tickets, but is an essential part of the annual routine.",
      "Nobody except Emily Eavis knows who'll be headlining next year - but rumours are rumours, and everybody enjoys speculating about the line-up.",
      "Oasis, whose reunion tour takes place next summer, have already ruled themselves out. But current contenders for the top slots include Sam Fender, who put on an incredible Pyramid Stage performance two years ago; and Olivia Rodrigo, who's already headlining the BST Festival in London on Glastonbury weekend.",
      "Eminem and Rihanna are among the perennial will-they/won't-they headliners, while Billy Joel and Stevie Wonder are supposedly in the running for the legend slot.",
      "In previous years, piecemeal confirmation of the line-up has started in November, but the full rundown is typically kept under wraps until March.",

      "Before the east and west coast rap beef of the 1990s boiled over with the murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious BIG, legendary producer Quincy Jones called a secret meeting at which he appealed for an end to the violence.",
      "As hip-hop rose from the streets to the mainstream in the 90s, the rappers and hustlers that broke through had few role models who had trodden that path before them.",
      "There was one man, though, who had been there, and done pretty much everything.",
      "Quincy Jones had been in gangs and had been stabbed at the age of seven in 1930s Chicago, before becoming a major force in American music thanks to his work with legends like Ray Charles, Frank Sinatra and Michael Jackson.",
      "He was at the heart of revolutions in jazz, swing, soul, funk, disco and pop - but one aspect of his career that got less attention when he died last week at the age of 91 was his place in hip-hop.",
      "Jones was revered in all corners of music, including rap. Unlike most in the old guard and the media, he immediately realised the scene's artistic and cultural importance.",
      "Hip-hop reminded him of the bebop jazz of his youth. \"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "\"Quincy understood it and got it right away,\" says pioneering artist, rapper and presenter Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "Jones worked with leading rappers in the 80s, and in the 90s he recognised risks including a volatile rivalry that had begun to erupt between competing labels and stars.",
      "So he brought artists, executives and elder black American statesmen together for a secret summit in 1995, hoping it would be a turning point.",
      "The east coast was hip-hop's spiritual home. In 1992, Sean Combs - then known as Puffy and later as P Diddy - launched his Bad Boy record label in New York with artists including Notorious BIG, aka Biggie Smalls.",
      "Meanwhile, across America, Los Angeles was coming into its own as the capital of gangsta rap, led by menacing mogul Suge Knight's Death Row Records, which had Dr Dre and Tupac.",
      "In 1994, Tupac was shot and injured during a robbery in the lobby of a studio. He later implied that his former friend Biggie may have known about the attack in advance. Biggie then released the track Who Shot Ya?, which Tupac thought was about him.",
      "The beef continued at the Source magazine awards on 3 August 1995, when Knight goaded Combs and Bad Boy Records from the stage.",
      "Jones, who had his own magazine, Vibe, held his summit three weeks later.",
      "Quincy Jones: From 'street rat' to music mastermind",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "'He changed my life': Stars remember Quincy Jones",
      "The brewing east-west beef wasn't the only reason Jones called it - it was mainly intended to discuss the state of hip-hop and let the new generation hear life and business advice from a group of highly successful black executives.",
      "But rap's negative image and the burgeoning tensions were a big talking point.",
      "\"He knew this was a bubbling issue, and so his idea was to bring together a symposium,\" says Fab 5 Freddy, who was hosting Yo! MTV Raps at the time and was the event's moderator.",
      "Jones told the summit: \"The thing that really provoked me to say it's time to pay attention now is Tupac.\"",
      "Tupac was missing, however - he was in jail for sexual assault at the time. Suge and Dre were there, as were Combs and Biggie.",
      "Jones had already experienced his own beef with Tupac - the rapper criticised the producer in a 1993 edition of Source for marrying white women.",
      "\"We finally hooked up, even though it was tension conditions in the beginning,\" Jones said at the event.",
      "\"We finally talked to each other, and he said nobody had talked to him like that before.",
      "\"And I said, I can't take it any more. Because we can no longer afford to be non-political, and I'm talking to the hip-hop nation now.\"",
      "About 50 influential artists and executives were in the room, including Public Enemy's Chuck D, members of A Tribe Called Quest, MC Lyte, Kris Kross, Jermaine Dupri and Boyz n the Hood film-maker John Singleton.",
      "Jones wrote in his now-out-of-print 2001 autobiography: \"I had been concerned about the potentially volatile diversity of a group who'd never been in the same room together.\"",
      "They were joined by veteran executives Clarence Avant and Ahmet Ertegun, plus Colin Powell, the former national security adviser and head of the US military who would go on to become the first African-American secretary of state.",
      "Powell had presidential ambitions - that was why the summit was held in secret. Jones wanted to save Powell from being associated with the negative publicity that surrounded rap music.",
      "He switched venues at the last minute to throw press off the scent, and confiscated the recordings.",
      "\"Rest assured that my discretion is based on a deep respect for you and a valued friendship,\" Jones wrote to Powell in an unpublished letter held at Indianapolis University Library.",
      "\"I know that we are going to make a difference at this conference. Thanks for the way you handled the situation. Maybe we can turn the battleship an inch or two.\"",
      "Jones later wrote in his book: \"Some of the younger rappers didn't even know who he was. When addressing some of the more confrontational comments from the floor, Powell maintained his South Bronx demeanour and authoritative cool throughout.\"",
      "Fab 5 Freddy remembers one exchange between Powell and Knight. \"There was an encounter where he [Knight] had something to say, and Colin Powell responded.",
      "\"Here you have this guy who was a four-star general talking to Suge Knight, and he pretty much put Suge in his place.\"",
      "Jones finally released a clip of the event for a 2018 Netflix documentary about his life.",
      "\"We've got to seriously talk about what you are going to deal with,\" he is seen telling the assembled attendees.",
      "\"They are not playing, there's real bullets out there, believe me. Maybe literally and figuratively.",
      "\"It's a very emotional thing,\" he added, his voice cracking. \"I want to see you guys live to at least my age.\"",
      "\"Quincy did get emotional,\" Fab 5 Freddy recalls, \"because he sensed what could happen.",
      "\"And the worst, unfortunately, did happen.\"",
      "Who was Tupac Shakur?",
      "Ex-gang leader pleads not guilty to Tupac murder",
      "Diddy accused of 'revenge' rape over Tupac claims",
      "Jones had ended up reconciling with Tupac. After Tupac's 1993 comments, Jones's 17-year-old daughter Rashida - who would go on to star in US sitcom The Office - wrote an irate letter to Source attacking the rapper.",
      "When Tupac bumped into one of Jones's other daughters, Kidada, he apologised, thinking she was Rashida. But Tupac and Kidada hit it off and began a relationship.",
      "\"Though we got off to a rocky start, as I came to know and feel him I saw his enormous potential and sensitivity as an artist and as a human being,\" Quincy Jones wrote.",
      "There have also been claims that Tupac was planning to leave Death Row for Jones's record label.",
      "But in September 1996, a year after the summit, Tupac was shot and killed.",
      "A former gang leader, Duane \"Keffe D\" Davis, was charged with his murder last year. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Then in 1997, Notorious BIG was shot dead outside a party thrown by Jones's record label and magazine. No-one has ever been charged.",
      "Meanwhile, today Knight is in prison for a hit-and-run, while Combs is awaiting trial on charges of racketeering and sex trafficking, which he denies.",
      "The violence in the 90s \"wasn't necessary\" and was caused by \"wannabes and gang-related troublemakers\" on the edges of the music industry, according to Fab 5 Freddy.",
      "\"Also, the east/west coast beef was mainly ignited by jealousy. It was an ashtray fire fanned into a big deal by media outlets that led to Biggie and Tupac getting killed.\"",
      "Despite his stature, not even Jones could alter the forces of power and pride that were at work and prevent the bloodshed.",
      "Freddy believes some lessons were learned at the summit, however, and that it deserves a place in hip-hop history.",
      "\"It was incredible and electric to be in that room.",
      "\"It was a thrilling moment. And then it became even more legendary because it was never released, so the only people that really knew about it were the people that were there.\""

      "\"I didn't do any of that as a Jehovah's Witness.",

    "summary": "The singer and actress stars in Emilia P\u00e9rez, a new Netflix musical which has been tipped for awards.",
    "story": [
      "When Emilia P\u00e9rez premiered earlier this year, it became one of the breakout hits of the Cannes Film Festival, where its four lead stars jointly won best actress.",
      "On Wednesday, the Spanish-language musical is released worldwide on Netflix as the film awards race continues to heat up ahead of the Oscars in March.",
      "Selena Gomez, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karla Sof\u00eda Gasc\u00f3n and Adriana Paz launched the movie at the London Film Festival last month, where it continued to build its momentum.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez follows a dangerous Mexican Cartel leader (played by Gasc\u00f3n), who asks a high-powered lawyer named Rita (Salda\u00f1a) to help him fake his own death.",
      "But the reason he wants to retire and disappear from the world of crime isn't what you might expect - the drug baron wants to change gender and live a new life as a woman.",
      "The rest of the film focuses on four women, including the newly-transitioned Emilia P\u00e9rez, as they each pursue their own version of happiness in modern-day Mexico.",
      "P\u00e9rez is portrayed by Spanish trans actress Gasc\u00f3n, who has been tipped as a possible best actress contender in the forthcoming awards race.",
      "French director Jacques Audiard came up with the idea for the film after reading a chapter in Boris Razon's 2018 novel \u00c9coute about a drug lord who changes identity.",
      "Audiard went one step further for the film, and made it a story of changing gender.",
      "\"I was less interested in a change of identity to evade competitor drug barons, and more interested in the change of identity for the sake of the person she was and is,\u201d the director tells BBC News. \"I was more interested in the past and what led to that transition.\"",
      "The role required someone very specific \u2013 a trans actress, who was a Spanish speaker, who could also sing and dance.",
      "Recalling the casting process, Gasc\u00f3n explains: \u201cI was contacted when I was in Mexico by a production team, and was told 'We need an actress as crazy as you - you're the only one who can do this role, but you need to learn five songs for tomorrow!'",
      "\u201cAnd I was like 'OK, let's record the whole album and we'll go on tour as soon as you want!\u2019\" she jokes. \u201cBut I did say, \u2018this is going to be difficult, I'm not a singer'. But the team in the film, they worked with me incredibly, they really helped me with all the songs and made it so that we could do the best work possible.\u201d",
      "Asked about Gasc\u00f3n's casting, Audiard adds simply: \u201cWithout her, there would be no film.\u201d",
      "Interestingly, Gasc\u00f3n campaigned to play both the male and female roles \u2013 in other words, the character both before and after transition.",
      "Audiard had originally intended for a different actor to play the male drug lord Manitas, because, the director explains, he was \"uncomfortable asking [Gasc\u00f3n] to revisit something she was moving away from\".",
      "But, Gasc\u00f3n recalled: \u201cI said to Jacques, I want to play this role in the complete arc, because for me it is important to do the full part. It wouldn't be the same film if another actor played [Manitas].\"",
      "That meant using effects and make-up such as a fake beard, so she could play the drug baron in the first section of the musical.",
      "\"This film is this film because the same actress played the complete performance,\" Gasc\u00f3n continues. \"It's that kind of role you have once in your life and I didn't want to lose the opportunity to play this.\u201d",
      "The ongoing debate about whether actors should have lived experience of characters they play is complex, and Gasc\u00f3n herself says: \"I prefer that all actors have the full opportunities. When you chose this career, it's because you want to express another life that's not like your life.",
      "\"But,\" she continues, \"obviously when you are closer to the role of the character, it's better. In this case, I think it's beautiful, because I give all of myself to this role.\"",
      "Gasc\u00f3n has been described as a \"wonderful discovery\" by the Hollywood Reporter's David Rooney, who said she gives \"a magnificent performance\".",
      "\"The warmth, the joyous self-realisation, the complexity and authenticity... that illuminate her characterisation no doubt owe much to the parallels in the Spanish star\u2019s life - in her own words, she was an actor before becoming an actress, a father before becoming a mother.\"",
      "Gomez plays the drug lord's wife, who is kept in the dark about her former lover's new identity, while Paz portrays Emilia's new romantic interest after transitioning.",
      "Reviews of Emilia P\u00e9rez, which is released on Netflix next month, have been generally positive so far.",
      "\"It's a wild, gritty, glitter-soaked ride that defies convention and classification,\" said Entertainment Weekly's Maureen Lee Lenker.",
      "She praised the film's performances, commenting: \"Selena Gomez is a welcome surprise, shedding any remaining hints of her Disney Channel origins in her portrayal of a hard-loving wife of a narco.",
      "\"The film's climax in particular allows Gomez to shine as a dramatic actress in new ways. She conveys heartache and anguish through a tortured physicality that propels her into the unpredictable state of a woman on the verge of something dangerous.\"",
      "Asked by the BBC's Graham Norton if it was comfortable going back to the world of singing and dancing for the musical, Gomez said: \"No, because this was completely different.",
      "\"It was intricate dance moves I never knew my body could do, and it was also me playing a character so if anything I tried to avoid what I was comfortable with.\"",
      "The Telegraph's Tim Robey described the film as \"amazingly confident \u2013 it\u2019s clever, earnest, ridiculous, knowing, forceful and absolutely bonkers\", while Hoai-Tran Bui of Inverse said it was \"an emotionally fulfilling triumph\".",
      "Not all critics were as enthusiastic about the film, however.",
      "\"Emilia P\u00e9rez was originally intended to be an opera, which perhaps partly explains its saccharine sentimentality, repetitive lyrics, and diverging story branches. But that doesn\u2019t excuse its almost random, whiplash-inducing tonal pivots,\" said Slant's Kyle Turner.",
      "However, Lauren Bradshaw of Fangirl Freakout said: \"Emilia P\u00e9rez is a magnificent, genre-bending thrill ride that transcends the typical movie construct, breathing a fresh burst of excitement into the way we think about film.\"",
      "As an actress, Gomez is best known for starring in Only Murders in the Building, but also has a successful singing career with hits including Back To You, Wolves and Love You Like a Love Song.",
      "Her co-star Salda\u00f1a, meanwhile, has starred in a large number of blockbusters in the last two decades, with roles in the Avatar and Guardians of the Galaxy franchises.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Emilia P\u00e9rez could be a big awards player, but Academy voters may see an opportunity to recognise Salda\u00f1a's box office success via this more critically acclaimed work.",
      "Their co-star Adriana Paz is a Mexican actress whose credits include Not Forgotten, Hilda and La Caridad, while Gasc\u00f3n also had a successful acting career before transitioning in 2018.",
      "Emilia P\u00e9rez has already been selected as France's entry for the best international feature category at the Oscars, which take place in March.",
      "But despite the film's awards traction, Paz tells BBC News: \u201cI never think about that, really. I get into a project because I'm interested in the topic, character, director or actors, you do it because it really matters to you.\u201d",
      "She adds that the attention in recent months is unlike anything she's experienced in her career. \"It's been a lot,\" she says, \"because I've been working in Spain and have a long career in Mexico, and people have a recognition of my work, but not like [it's been] since Cannes.",
      "\"In my country they feel very proud of me, and there was a lot of people that didn't know about my work, and now thanks to Emilia they are getting to know my work... and they see 'we feel so proud as Mexicans that you won this award.'\"",
      "After the success of Emilia Perez, Paz says she would \"love to\" appear in more musicals in future, and loves singing.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n has a slightly different take. \"I don't like musicals!\" she laughs, adding that she hopes casting directors aren't too enthusiastic about her performance.",
      "\"I don't like to sing, I don't want to be compared to Shakira or something like that, and I don't like dancing, so please don't call me!\"",

      "Waiting lists for gynaecology appointments across the UK have more than doubled since February 2020, BBC research reveals.",
      "Records show around three-quarters of a million (755,046) women's health appointments are waiting to happen - up from 360,400 just before the pandemic.",
      "This would suggest around 630,000 people - at the very least - are on the list to be seen for problems that range from fibroids and endometriosis to incontinence and menopause care.",
      "Health ministers across the UK say they are working on plans to improve the situation, but health leaders say that women are being let down.",
      "'The illness controls my whole life'",
      "Anna Cooper, 31, from near Wrexham in North Wales, has had severe endometriosis since her teens.",
      "The condition - where tissue similar to the lining of the womb grows outside it  - has  left her with permanent organ damage.",
      "She has had to have 17 operations, including a hysterectomy to remove her womb.",
      "She also has two stomas in place for life because much of her bladder and bowel have had to be removed. She lives with her partner and young daughter.",
      "\"The disease controls my social life, my work life and my ability to function every day.",
      "\"It is not just a period problem - it is a whole body problem. It ripples through your body,\" she says.",
      "The BBC spoke to her in 2023 about setting up her own charity, Menstrual Health Project.",

      "Anna wears a morphine patch to help deal with pain every day.",
      "But for years, she says medics did not listen to her, and told her the pain was \"in her head\" and that she had to \"just get used to it\".",
      "She feels getting a diagnosis sooner would have changed her life: \"The delay in my care has cost me some of my major organs.",
      "\"Doctors have told me that if they'd caught it sooner, I wouldn't have ended up the way I am, living with two stomas and being in early menopause at the age of 31.\"",
      "In the last three years she made the decision to spend \u00a325,000 on private operations, borrowing money to help.",
      "She counts herself lucky to get private care but feels she was \"almost left with no choice\" because the waiting lists are so long: \"I can be a mum who isn't just in her bed constantly because she is crippled with pain.\"",
      "Endometriosis has \"mentally tormented\" her for the most of her adult life.",
      "\"It is really difficult dealing with a condition where I look absolutely fine from the outside, but internally, I'm just in despair.\"",
      "'Lack of priority'",
      "\"Women are being let down\" and change is \"urgently needed,\" says Dr Ranee Thakar, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).",
      "The college's new report looks at the impact on people waiting for care.",
      "\"Gynaecology is the only elective speciality that solely treats women and has one of the worst waiting lists across the UK.",
      "\"This reflects the persistent lack of priority given to women and women\u2019s health, \" Dr Thakar says.",
      "\"Women are suffering. We know it is affecting their mental health. They are not able to go to work, they are not able to socialize.\"",
      "Dr Thakar adds that if the women had been treated earlier, their conditions wouldn't have progressed as much, and they would continue to contribute to society.",
      "A recent report led by the NHS Confederation suggests being absent from work because of heavy periods, endometriosis, fibroids and ovarian cysts costs the UK economy nearly \u00a311 billion each year.",
      "The RCOG is calling for governments to commit more long-term funding, to ensure people get the help they need.",
      "There are some signs that waiting lists are starting to improve.",
      "Waits have not been rising as steeply this year and NHS England's latest figures show there has been a drop in numbers on the waiting list of over 4,700 compared to the month before.",
      "But the situation is still much worse than pre-pandemic. In Feb 2020 there were 66 gynaecology  waits of more than a year. Now there are more than 22,000.",
      "Women on gynae waiting lists 'feel abandoned'",
      "Dr Sue Mann, NHS England's national clinical director for women\u2019s health, acknowledged  some women wait too long for crucial gynaecology appointments, despite staff working hard to see more patients.",
      "She says one way of helping is specialist teams working outside of hospitals.",
      "\u201cSome of these conditions can be managed very well by specialist healthcare teams in the community, which is why we are expanding neighbourhood women\u2019s health hubs in every local care system across the country.\"",
      "In Wales, the government plans to publish a women's health plan next month.",
      "\u201cA 10-year Women\u2019s Health Plan is being developed to drive the improvement needed to provide good quality health services to women throughout their lifetime,\"  a Welsh Government spokesperson said.",
      "Regions in Northern Ireland are working on plans to improve gynaecology services, taking on the 20 recommendations made in a recent report.",
      "The department of health says some will require \"additional funding and lead-in time.\"",
      "Scotland's Women\u2019s Health Minister Jenni Minto said excessively long waits were not acceptable and more money was going towards women's health.",
      "\"That is why one of the initial priorities of the women\u2019s health plan is to improve access for women to appropriate support, diagnosis and treatment.\"",
      "Anna Cooper is hoping ministers \"follow through with their words\".",
      "When governments say they are going to prioritize women's health, then they need to show they are doing just that, she says.",
      "\"Currently they are not showing it, and this is people's lives we are rolling the dice on... And having a daughter, I really fear for young girls' and women's futures.\"",
      "How we arrived at the figures",
      "To estimate the size of the gynaecology waiting list for the UK we added together the most recent figures available for all four nations, as tracked by the RCOG.",
      "This includes waits for gynaecology appointments and planned procedures and excludes urgent appointments for things like suspected cancer.",
      "It tells you how big the waiting list is, but some patients may need more than one appointment.",
      "Our estimate for the number of people waiting is at least 634,239  - and it  could be considerably more.",
      "We worked this out by looking at data from the NHS in England that suggests across waiting lists there is around a 16% difference between the number of appointments and people waiting.",
      "We have applied this to the gynaecology waiting list.",
      "It could underestimate the size of the problem, as gynaecology patients are less likely to be waiting for two appointments than patients in some other specialities.",

      "TV presenter Davina McCall is out of intensive care and has made an \"enormous leap forward\" in the last 24 hours, following her surgery to remove a rare brain tumour.",
      "In an update on her Instagram account her partner Michael Douglas said: \"Thanks so much to all the well wishers. She really has made an enormous leap forward in the last 24 hours. She is out of ICU.\"",
      "The 57-year-old previously posted a video on Instagram, to say she had been diagnosed with a type of benign tumour called a colloid cyst.",
      "A benign tumour is not cancerous, but such cysts tend to grow slowly, according to the Brainstrust charity.",
      "\"Massive relief to see some light coming though. Thanks for all the good vibes coming in from all angles,\" Mr Douglas continued in the post to McCall's 1.9 million followers.",
      "Ahead of her surgery McCall had explained how the tumour had been found by chance.",
      "\"A few months ago, I did a menopause talk for a company and they offered me a health scan in return, which I thought I was going to ace,\" she said in a video posted on Friday.",
      "\"But it turned out I had a benign brain tumour called a colloid cyst, which is very rare - three in a million.\"",
      "Colloid cysts typically form in a fluid-filled cavity in the centre of the brain, and are themselves filled with fluid, the Brains Trust says.",
      "They account for less than 2% of all primary brain tumours, and the rate of growth and symptoms can vary from person to person, according to the charity.",
      "McCall explained a surgeon would perform a procedure called a craniotomy, where part of the skull is removed to take out the tumour.",
      "Mr Douglas previously said the operation had been \"textbook\".",
      "McCall's long TV presenting career includes Channel 4's Big Brother, ITV's Long Lost Family, and My Mum, Your Dad, along with Comic and Sport Relief for the BBC.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 08:02:53 GMT",
    "summary": "The new measures aim to stop private care home providers benefiting excessively from a stretched system.",
    "story": [
      "Plans aimed at preventing companies that run children's homes in England from making excessive profits will be set out by the government on Monday.",
      "It says it will bring forward new measures that will require large providers to disclose their finances. If they do not limit their profits voluntarily, they will face a legal limit on how much they can make.",
      "The government also intends to strengthen the powers regulator Ofsted has to investigate and fine \"exploitative\" children's home providers that prey on a stretched care system.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",
      "The government will set out legislation in Parliament on Monday that will require major care home providers to share their finances with the government, so it can challenge what it describes as profiteering.",
      "This will also include a \"backstop\" law that would place a limit on those profits, which the government can put into effect if the companies do not do so voluntarily.",
      "The government says the measure will also allow it to ensure that the largest providers do not suddenly collapse into administration, leaving children homeless.",
      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",
      "The government says it is acting on the recommendation of a child safeguarding panel, which reviewed allegations of abuse at three children's homes in Doncaster run by the Hesley Group.",
      "In 2023, the BBC revealed that more than 100 reports concerning abuse and neglect were logged at the sites between 2018 and 2021. Children were allegedly beaten, locked outside naked in the cold and had vinegar poured on cuts.",
      "At the time, Hesley made a 16% profit from the sites it ran.",
      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",
      "An expert panel tasked to review the incidents said a \"major overhaul\" of the safeguarding system was needed.",
      "Annie Hudson, the panel's chair, said the new legislation would \"go some way towards tackling some of the systemic weaknesses that can create the conditions where very vulnerable children are abused and neglected\".",
      "Plans for children's homes register after abuse",
      "Culture of abuse found at special schools - review",
      "Assaults and neglect revealed in care homes probe",
      "Phillipson added England's care system was \"bankrupting councils, letting families down, and above all, leaving too many children feeling forgotten, powerless and invisible\".",
      "The government's other planned measures include:",
      "Strengthening the rights of families to be involved in decisions about a child going into careRequiring every council to have multi-agency child safeguarding teamsRequiring local authorities to offer support for care leavers, including helping them find accommodation, until the age of 21Compelling families with a child who has had a protection inquiry or protection plan for them to have council permission to home-school them",

      "Compelling families with a child who has had a protection inquiry or protection plan for them to have council permission to home-school them",
      "The BBC understands that the government will also outline action to deal with the rise in Deprivation of Liberty Orders, which have increased 12-fold in the last seven years.",
      "These court orders allow children to be locked up - in registered or unregistered homes - and are often granted for children who are a risk to themselves or others. Dame Rachel de Souza, the children\u2019s commissioner, says far fewer should be granted.",
      "Responding to the government's plans, the Children's Home Association (CHA), which represents providers in England and Wales, said the new Ofsted powers that will \"tackle unregistered and unregulated illegal residential provision is long overdue\".",
      "However, it argued the \"backstop\" law that threatens to cap providers' profits \"risks serious unintended consequences\" as it would \"incentivise more providers to adopt offshore interest and debt-driven business models\".",
      "The CHA also criticised Phillipson's comment that the sector was letting families down, saying it was \"not involved with families or their decisions\" and took in children \"because social work and preventative measures fail, likely due to local authorities' lack of financial resources\".",
      "Paul Carberry, chief executive of charity Action for Children, welcomed the government's plan, but said that \"urgent investment in not-for-profit and public sector provision is required to create stability and make sure every child gets the placement they need\".",

      "Adding folic acid to flour could prevent around 200 cases of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida, every year, and improve the health of pregnant women, says the government, which is giving manufacturers until the end of 2026 to conform to the new legal requirement.",

      "The vitamin folate, also known as vitamin B9, is found in everyday foods such as beans and some green vegetables, meaning most people receive a sufficient dose  from eating a regular, healthy diet.",
      "In addition, the NHS recommends women who are trying for a baby take folic acid supplements for approximately three months before getting pregnant, and for at least 12 weeks after becoming pregnant. This recommendation will remain in place.",
      "It is estimated that half of all pregnancies in the UK are unplanned. The fortification of flour will therefore help boost intake of folic acid across the population, and, indirectly, better protect unborn babies.",

      "The government is preparing to face the biggest protest yet over its domestic policy agenda since Labour won the general election.",
      "It is the week where farmers are heading for Westminster - and bringing some noisy and influential friends with them.",
      "Among those expected outside Parliament on Tuesday is the country\u2019s most well known but relatively new-ish farmer, Jeremy Clarkson.",
      "Guesswork about how many people will turn up at a protest before it has happened is exactly that, guesswork, but some reckon it could be between 10,000 and 40,000 people.",
      "Nearly three weeks on from the Budget, when the plan to charge some farms inheritance tax was first announced, the anger seems to be growing, rather than easing.",
      "There is a huge row about precisely how many people might be affected.",
      "BBC Verify had a go here at working its way through the numbers.",
      "But beneath that is a simmering anger about ministers\u2019 perceived ignorance about the countryside - and a sense from many farmers of being persistently let down, by this government and its predecessors.",
      "Indeed, speaking on The Westminster Hour on BBC Radio 4,  Baroness Mallalieu, a Labour peer and the president of the Countryside Alliance, said the government\u2019s changes to inheritance tax relief \u201csmell of incompetence\u201d and that a \"large part of our party has become urban... divorced from a big section of the community\".",
      "Two things strike me about all this: firstly, the absolute insistence from ministers from Sir Keir Starmer down that they are not going to change their minds.",
      "And secondly, the beginnings of a parallel, perhaps, with the rows Labour had with many in rural Britain the last time it was in power.",
      "Twenty-two years ago, around 400,000 people from across the country marched through central London to highlight the needs of rural communities.",
      "The initial source of anger then was the ban on fox hunting.",
      "Could this inheritance tax change prove equally totemic?",
      "As farmers head for Westminster, the prime minister has been heading for South America - he is at the G20 Summit of the world\u2019s biggest economies in Brazil for the next few days.",
      "But the issue followed him into the skies of the south Atlantic, where he said he was \u201cabsolutely confident\u201d that the \u201cvast majority of farms and farmers\u201d would not be affected by the changes.",
      "\u201cIt's important for us to keep communicating how that works\u201d he said.",
      "The truth is they have been trying to communicate how it would work ever since the Budget.  I asked Sir Keir about it the day after - but the explanations have done little to dampen the anger.",
      "Asked whether he accepted that farmers felt betrayed over the changes, Sir Keir said \u201cit's very important that we support farmers.\u201d",
      "He then made an argument we can expect to hear the Environment Secretary Steve Reed and others make in the next few days, about the wider support the government insists it is offering farmers and the countryside.",
      "\"We\u2019ve put \u00a35bn in the Budget for the next two years into farming. That is not to be overlooked. That is the single biggest sum of money in a Budget over a two-year period that has ever been put down in relation to farming.",
      "\"On top of that, there\u2019s \u00a350m in relation to flooding, which is hugely important and \u00a3200m in relation to the outbreak of disease and infection which can be absolutely devastating.\u201d",
      "Bunkum say people in agriculture, suggesting this a creative spinning of the numbers and the money around now is comparable with when the UK left the European Union.",
      "Incidentally, one government source even pointed to the planned changes to bus services in England  as an example of how their ideas can help people in rural areas.",
      "It shows their desire to attempt to mend fences with a swathe of the country some privately fear could turn against them if they don\u2019t handle this well.",
      "So why has this row become so noisy so quickly?",
      "From the conversations I have had, I think there are three main reasons.",
      "Bid to soften farm tax change rejected by Treasury",
      "Most farmers won't pay inheritance tax, PM insists",
      "Tax change 'is existential threat to farmers'",
      "Firstly, inheritance tax, perhaps like no other tax, has an outsized emotive tug on so, so many people - in fact a far greater number of people than are ever likely to end up paying it.",
      "The House of Commons Library, citing opinion polling, has described it as \u201cthe most unpopular tax in the UK\u201d, even though just 3.7% of deaths led to an inheritance tax bill in 2020-21.",
      "Some argue it is unfair as it represents double taxation; being taxed on money that has already been taxed.",
      "For others, their opposition is much more deeply seated, a sense that it seeks to dilute the most human of all human emotions, to provide for your children when you are gone.",
      "Secondly, throw into the mix a political rule first invented by The Economist magazine: \u201cNever pick a fight with a profession that appears in a children\u2019s book.\u201d",
      "Trades that are universally understood, at least in broad brush terms, and provide for our most essential needs can be very effective lobby groups, the argument goes.",
      "Think doctors and nurses, but also farmers and food.",
      "Thirdly, I am told it is worth seeing this row about inheritance tax in a wider context.",
      "\u201cIt is the straw that has broken the camel\u2019s back,\u201d is how one farming source put it to me.",
      "There was the new trade deal with Australia, which many farmers think undermines them.",
      "There are the adjustments to farm subsidies being made after Brexit.",
      "And there has been the seemingly never-ending chopping and changing of farming ministers as various prime ministers have come and gone. There have been five farming ministers in the last five years.",

      "Plans aimed at preventing companies that run children's homes in England from making excessive profits will be set out by the government on Monday.",
      "It says it will bring forward new measures that will require large providers to disclose their finances. If they do not limit their profits voluntarily, they will face a legal limit on how much they can make.",
      "The government also intends to strengthen the powers regulator Ofsted has to investigate and fine \"exploitative\" children's home providers that prey on a stretched care system.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said \"thousands of children have been failed\" within the care system.",
      "\"Frankly some of the accommodation and placements are deeply, deeply shocking,\" she told BBC Breakfast, adding that this was due to both the conditions and the \"terrible outcomes\" for some of the most vulnerable children in the country.",
      "The changes are part of a major overhaul of the children\u2019s social care system, which supports and protects vulnerable young people.",
      "The measures come as council-run children's services are struggling with rising demand, complex cases and spiralling costs.",
      "Local authorities say there were more than 1,500 children in 2023 for whom councils were paying more than \u00a3500,000 a year to be placed in residential homes, with a lack of other options being the most common reason.",
      "Meanwhile, a 2022 report by the Competition and Markets Authority found the 15 largest children's home providers make an average 23% profit per year.",

      "But Andrew Rome, an accountant and leading analyst in the field, said the 10 largest providers only account for 26% of all children's homes in England, with many providers being much smaller.",
      "He told the BBC that this measure will miss \"smaller opportunists who are charging the extraordinary prices for unregulated [or] unregistered services\".",
      "Mr Rome also said gaining oversight of large providers' finances would be difficult as they often operate through a network of companies, while smaller firms may only have to disclose limited financial information.",
      "He added that a \"backstop\" law to limit profits was \"close to impossible to design and police\".",
      "The government also intends to give Ofsted the power to issue private providers, including unregistered homes, with civil fines to \"deter unscrupulous behaviour\".",
      "It accused some providers of \"siphoning off money that should be going towards vulnerable children\" from homes that \"don\u2019t meet the right standards of care\".",
      "In September, a court in Liverpool heard that unregistered children's homes were demanding up to \u00a320,000 per child a week from a local authority. The council said it was forced to agree to such fees because it could not find anywhere else to place the children - despite it being unlawful to send them there.",
      "Ofsted will also be empowered to investigate multiple homes being run by the same company.",
      "The government says it is acting on the recommendation of a child safeguarding panel, which reviewed allegations of abuse at three children's homes in Doncaster run by the Hesley Group.",
      "In 2023, the BBC revealed that more than 100 reports concerning abuse and neglect were logged at the sites between 2018 and 2021. Children were allegedly beaten, locked outside naked in the cold and had vinegar poured on cuts.",
      "At the time, Hesley made a 16% profit from the sites it ran.",
      "Ofsted received 108 reports about the sites, which housed children with disabilities and complex health needs, but still rated them as \"good\". The regulator and the Hesley Group have both since apologised for the failings, and the three homes have been closed.",
      "An expert panel tasked to review the incidents said a \"major overhaul\" of the safeguarding system was needed.",

      "That night his mother took him to the local accident and emergency unit. He was stooping as he leant on the front desk. \"Have you got a bad back?\" the receptionist asked cheerily. \"No,\" he replied. \"I'm suicidal.\"",

      "\"I was quite lonely to be honest,\" Wragg says. \"It was an evening at the end of January. I was back at my flat in London following a day at Westminster, and I was just on my blank online profile. And I saw his profile and messaged to say hello.\"",
      "\u2018Charlie\u2019 seemed to know a lot about the world of UK politics and soon the conversation moved to WhatsApp. Wragg thought this might be the start of a relationship.",
      "\"I was actually very flattered because he was an attractive guy,\" Wragg says. \"And he had a manner in the conversation that was assertive, but slightly cocky. That's an attractive quality too.\"",

      "\"Obviously it wasn't,\" Wragg replies. \u201cBut when you're in the moment it wasn't a consideration. I know that might sound ridiculous, people think how stupid can you be? But we're all human. We all have those desires. I'm as fallible as the next person.\"",
      "The pair spoke on the phone two or three times but when they arranged a date at a pub near Parliament, Wragg was stood up.",
      "\"It didn't materialise obviously, because as it transpired he wasn't real. But I didn't know that at the time,\" he says.",

      "Was he being blackmailed?",
      "\"I don't know,\" he says. \"There was never anything that was explicit to say that, but I certainly felt a threat.\"",
      "Wragg also concedes that amidst the intoxication of possible romance he felt \"a sense of wanting to please\" \u2018Charlie\u2019. He ended up handing over around a dozen phone numbers, including for a number of MPs.",
      "At the time, then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said Wragg was right to apologise, while minister Mel Stride called his actions \"exceptionally inappropriate and ill-advised\".",
      "I point out his actions made the situation worse, resulting in others also becoming victims.",

      "Police had first been made aware of a catfisher targeting people involved in UK politics in late 2023, but the news began to emerge more widely in April, after a story was published on the Politico news website. Catfishing involves setting up a fake online identity to trick and control others.",
      "Wragg was on a train when he saw the article. \"My stomach just dropped,\" he says. \"I thought gosh this must have so much to do with the person I've been interacting with.\"",
      "Approached by a journalist from the Times, Wragg admitted chatting with someone on an app who subsequently asked him for the numbers of others.",
      "He apologised for his \"weakness\", resigned the Conservative whip and stood down from his posts on two parliamentary committees. He had already announced he would not stand in the next general election.",
      "\"When I found out some of the things that had been going on, I just felt enormous guilt, enormous remorse,\" he tells me. \"My mood just plummeted.\"",
      "Wragg had struggled with his mental health in the past and had already stopped taking his antidepressants, which he considers a factor in the suicidal thoughts which led him to be admitted to hospital.",
      "The Westminster catfishing operation was sophisticated, and had been under way for many months before Wragg became involved. But he concedes that his actions led to friends and colleagues also becoming victims.",
      "Wragg says he feels \"great regret\" and has \"sought to apologise\", adding: \"I hope I can explain it in the context of the almost sense of control, the influence this person had over me.\"",
      "However, one former MP who believes his number was passed on by Wragg told the BBC: \"None of us to my recollection have ever received an apology from Will\u2026 It might be an idea for him to apologise to those he dropped in the dirt.\"",
      "Contrary to some early speculation, police have said they do not think any other foreign state was involved. In June a member of the Labour Party in his mid-20s was arrested in London on suspicion of harassment and offences under the Online Safety Act. He has been bailed until late November.",
      "Seven months on from the height of the scandal, Wragg has left the world of Westminster behind. He is much happier, he says, but still talks of the \"shame\" he feels and the \"havoc\" the catfisher wrought.",
      "\"I have no bitterness or anger left in me,\" he says, when I ask how he feels about the catfisher. \"Because I felt so wretched and awful in myself.\"",
      "He believes they were motivated by sexual kicks and by the power they held over others.",
      "\"My only wish for them is not to do it any more,\" he says. \"And to understand that impersonating or pretending to be somebody\u2026 it's not victimless. It is very real and its psychological impact is particularly strong.\"",
      "Wragg hopes by speaking out he may help others to spot the signs of catfishing, and report it. ActionFraud has received almost 7,500 reports of dating scams so far this year.",
      "\"It\u2019s a source of great shame that my time in Parliament ended in this way,\" he says.",
      "On his final day as an MP, Wragg had a consultation with a psychologist, which he jokes is \"a fitting summation\" of his nine years in the Commons.",
      "\"They have two mental health beds available at any one time for members of Parliament. And it's surprising how often they're occupied.\"",
      "The trauma of recent months has undoubtedly damaged his interest in dating. Does he think he\u2019ll find love? \"I hope so, yes,\" he says. \"But I'm being a bit more guarded at the moment.\"",

      "The Home Office \"cut corners\" and made \"poor decisions\", while under pressure to stop housing migrants in hotels, when it paid \u00a315m for an asbestos-contaminated derelict prison, the government's spending watchdog has said.",

      "A report found \"corners [were] cut\" so the site could be acquired quickly to house asylum seekers despite an assessment deeming it \"high risk\".",
      "The Home Office said the report related to the last government's actions and it remained \"committed to ending the use of hotels\".",

Does the government have a mandate for that in this parliamentary term, having ruled out changes to the main tax rates?",
      "If a review process took longer, would any political party want to go into the next election asking voters to pay more - even for the best of reasons, a shiny new social care system?",
      "\u2018Same old stalemate\u2019",
      "In truth, conversations about the process are only a symbol of the actual dilemma \u2013 not just what to do, but how to pay.",
      "The Department of Health wants to get on with the process. The Treasury agrees that it\u2019s a very serious problem that the government ought to fix (and people caught up in the system, often stuck in hospital, are costly to the whole NHS too). Yet the chancellor is understood to be nervous about the cost of any fix, which would run to many billions.",
      "One source told me: \u201cThe Treasury is the block.\u201d But a department insider rejects that characterisation, and says: \u201cNo one doubts the issue is huge, but any solution is expensive \u2013 everything is a trade-off.\u201d",
      "Others suggest Reeves wants reform but also wants to be sure of a full political backing from the neighbours at No 10. So it\u2019s suggested both Streeting and Reeves are looking to Sir Keir.",
      "A No 10 source told me the prime minister is \u201canimated by solving the issue and is keen to proceed\u201d, hence the meeting planned with the health secretary and chancellor in the next fortnight. The source denies the accusation of \u201cdither\u201d, saying it takes time to work out the right moves.",
      "There is no suggestion this is a bruising split between ministers.",
      "But another source familiar with the process told me: \"As soon as the election was out of the way we went back into the same old stalemate.\" In other words, the Department of Health says please, the Treasury says no, and No 10 wants more time to think.",
      "\u2018It\u2019s almost too late\u2019",
      "Inside the care sector itself, one leader says people are \u201cworn\u201d by the debate between different parts of government when the need for change is urgent. Another care source tells me \u201cit\u2019s already almost too late\u201d and is upset at how the industry has been treated so far.",
      "They say existing government plans and the decisions in the Budget have made life harder. Asking care providers to pay the extra costs of employers\u2019 national insurance means that, effectively, \u201cpublic services are charged to pay for a black hole in (you guessed it) public services\u201d, they say.",
      "The NHS itself will be exempt from those increased costs but, as things stand, not-for-profit organisations including some care charities providing public services will have to pay.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "A group of them have written to the chancellor as part of a grassroots campaign called Providers Unite, warning the increased payments could top \u00a31bn. They have asked Reeves to look again at the changes or face \u201ca systematic collapse of community care services across Britain\u201d.",
      "The chancellor told us after the Budget she is \u201cnot immune\u201d to pleas from particular sectors, but there is no chance of her reversing the whole policy.",
      "On top of charging more National Insurance, ministers are creating a negotiating body to improve pay and conditions for care staff. While the industry is broadly supportive of that aim, it will increase costs, and many believe they just can\u2019t cover it without extra funding.",
      "There is an obvious eagerness for the government to get on with the conversation about how to fix the system that cares for the most vulnerable adults in the long term. But, wearily, a source told me conversation in the industry is \u201cso dominated by funding emergencies now, [long-term reform] is second order\u201d.",
      "Pressure builds for a decision",
      "When the prime minister, Streeting and Reeves sit down to consider what to do about social care in a week or so, don\u2019t expect a sudden revelation or a shiny new plan. One source told me \u2013 in a line worthy of the sitcom Yes Minister \u2013 that the trio might \u201cdecide to decide, decide to delay deciding, or\u2026 decide not to decide\u201d.",
      "But the pressure is building on them to make a call.",
      "While the Conservatives promised then failed multiple times to follow through with big changes to the system, the newly emboldened Lib Dems put social care right at the centre of their successful election campaign.",
      "It\u2019s the party\u2019s signature issue, and rarely a day goes by without them pursuing a political opportunity to press the case. The Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey, who will join me on tomorrow's show, said that any investment in the NHS would be an \"expensive failure\" without social care reform.",
      "\"Ministers need to get a grip, and quickly,\" he said. \"The cross-party talks we've been campaigning for should start now, but there are urgent actions the government should take regardless,\" such as a higher minimum wage for care workers.",
      "And a spokesperson for the Conservatives said: \"The Labour Party are piling on costs for social care providers and charities. The Local Government Association has warned that any extra funding will be consumed by the costs as a result of Labour\u2019s budget.\"",
      "Few in government would deny that a solution for social care is long overdue. Few in government would deny that patients are being let down, and families are being left without the support they need. And few in government would deny that Sir Keir\u2019s mission to sort out the NHS is hampered by a lack of action.",
      "A source familiar with the dilemmas told me it \u201cbeggars belief\u201d that minsters can talk about giving the NHS extra billions and promising reform without doing the same for social care.",
      "Yet nobody wants to repeat previous governments\u2019 pattern, where plans were drawn up, pitched to the public, then ditched (the Scottish Government has again shelved plans for its promised National Care Service).",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 12:36:29 GMT",
    "summary": "The chancellor says she wants to \u201cfire up the UK\u2019s economy\u201d with a \"Canadian-style\" pensions model.",
    "story": [
      "Plans for a major shake-up of pension funds have been announced by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.",
      "She wants to create pension \"megafunds\" by merging the UK's 86 council schemes, using the set-up in Canada and Australia as a model.",
      "Other proposals suggest pension schemes need to reach a certain size or pool together. Larger funds could then be invested in UK infrastructure projects, the government says.",
      "So, will this affect people with pension savings?",
      "Which pension funds are involved?",
      "The government says the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) can get more from investments - while tackling a \u00a32bn bill for fees - by joining together.",
      "There are 86 local government pension funds in England and Wales, which are mainly paid into by local government workers.",
      "These individually managed funds are divided by local authority, making it more costly, because each fund is paying its own management and administration fees.",
      "Between them, they have 6.5 million members and manage assets worth \u00a3354bn.",
      "The schemes are all part of the LGPS which is the seventh-largest in the world, according to the UK government.",
      "Most of its participants are low-paid women.",
      "Under Reeves\u2019 plans, the funds would be consolidated in some way, although at present it is unclear exactly how.",
      "She may ask them to pool their assets and resources, or she may ask them to merge with one another to create a smaller number of larger funds, which would benefit from greater financial firepower and fewer costs.",
      "The LGPS is a defined benefit scheme which means that, when it is time to draw their pensions, its savers get an agreed amount based on their salary, no matter what the fund is worth at the time.",
      "So drawing scheme into \"megafunds\" will make little, or no, difference to what they receive.",
      "That is different to private pension pots, which rise and fall in value depending on how investments perform.",
      "Why copy Canada and Australia?",
      "The \u201cMaple 8\u201d is a group of vast Canadian pension funds, including the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which manages assets worth C$247.5bn (\u00a3141.8bn), and the Canada Pension Plan, whose assets are worth C$409.6bn.",
      "While UK pension schemes tend to invest more in assets like equities and bonds, their Canadian rivals focus more on private markets.",
      "The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, only has 7% of its assets in listed equities, compared with 60% for traditional pension funds.",
      "Instead, it skews its investments towards private markets, including infrastructure (including a 25% stake in British energy giant SSE), real estate and private equity deals.",
      "This kind of model is not without risk, however.",
      "The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System is the largest investor in the troubled Thames Water, which has been highlighted by those questioning Reeves' plans.",
      "Why is bigger supposed to be better?",
      "Individually, the UK\u2019s 86 local government pension schemes vary in size, from Greater Manchester\u2019s massive \u00a330bn fund all the way down to several schemes which are \u201csub-\u00a31bn\u201d, according to Joanne Donnelly, board secretary at the Local Government Pension Scheme Advisory Board.",
      "Running these schemes costs money. Each one must pay administration, governance and management costs, which can build up \u2013 last year, they increased by \u00a328m.",
      "Like her predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, who also announced plans for a Canadian-style model, the chancellor believes consolidation would save money.",
      "That would in turn \u201cdeliver better returns for savers and unlock billions of pounds of investment\u201d.",
      "Other chancellors have aimed to make similar moves, including George Osborne who, in 2015, set out plans for local government schemes to pool resources,",
      "Does everyone agree with the idea?",
      "Tracy Blackwell, chief executive of Pension Insurance Corporation, told the BBC: \"I think by having the scale and the right expertise internally to invest in a wide range of assets, they'll be able to invest in a lot more than what they can invest in now.\"",
      "However, some argue megafunds would not invest so much in smaller projects while some claim the changes could bring risks for pension savers.",
      "\"Conflating a government goal of driving investment in the UK and people\u2019s retirement outcomes brings a danger because the risks are all taken with members\u2019 money,\" said Tom Selby at investment platform AJ Bell.",
      "He said the current system encourages trustees to deliver the best outcome for members rather than focus on UK-wide economic growth, which might mean investing outside the UK.",
      "Others question whether there are enough big UK projects to invest in.",
      "\"Large funds need substantial, reliable projects to generate returns, but the market may struggle to offer enough of these opportunities, especially in the infrastructure sector,\" said Jon Greer, head of retirement policy at wealth manager Quilter."

      "\u201cI am a little bit exhausted,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve come here from Paris. And after here I go to Berlin, then Geneva. I\u2019m on this tour talking about the danger to the environment and some of the remedies,\u201d she says.",
      "\u2018The sixth great extinction is happening now\u2019",
      "One of the remedies she wants to talk about today is a tree-planting and habitat restoration mission that her eponymous foundation and non-profit technology company, Ecosia, are carrying out in Uganda. Over the past five years, with the help of local communities and smallholder farmers, the organisations have planted nearly two million trees.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of the sixth great extinction,\u201d Dr Goodall tells me during our interview for BBC Radio 4\u2019s Inside Science. \u201cThe more we can do to restore nature and protect existing forests, the better.\u201d",
      "The primary aim of this project is to restore the threatened habitat of Uganda\u2019s 5,000 chimpanzees. Dr Goodall has studied and campaigned to protect the primates for decades. But the activist also wants to highlight the threat that deforestation poses to our climate.",
      "\u201cTrees have to grow to a certain size before they can really do their work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut all this [tree-planting] is helping to absorb carbon dioxide.\u201d",
      "\u2018Window of time to save climate is closing\u2019",
      "This week, world leaders have gathered in Baku, Azerbaijan, for COP29 - the latest round of UN climate talks.",
      "And Dr Goodall says taking action to slow down the warming of our planet is more urgent than ever.",
      "\u201cWe still have a window of time to start slowing down climate change and loss of biodiversity,\u201d Dr Goodall says. \u201cBut it's a window that's closing.\u201d",
      "Destruction of forests, and other wild places, she points out, is intrinsically linked to the climate crisis.",
      "\u201cSo much has changed in my lifetime,\u201d she says, recalling that in the forests of Tanzania where she began studying chimps more than 60 years ago, \u201cyou used to be able to set your calendar by the timing of the two rainy seasons\u201d.",
      "\u201cNow, sometimes it rains in the dry season, and sometimes it's dry in the wet season. It means the trees are fruiting at the wrong time, which upsets the chimpanzees, and also the insects and the birds.\u201d",
      "Over the decades that she has studied and campaigned to protect the habitat of wild chimpanzees, she says she has seen the destruction of forests across Africa: \u201cAnd I've seen the decrease in chimpanzee numbers.",
      "\u201cIf we don't get together and impose tough regulations on what people are able to do to the environment - if we don't rapidly move away from fossil fuel, if we don't put a stop to industrial farming, that's destroying the environment and killing the soil, having a devastating effect on biodiversity - the future ultimately is doomed.\u201d",
      "\u2018He looked into my eyes and squeezed my fingers\u2019",
      "Hearing her speak in this way gives me a glimpse of a toughness that belies her well-spoken, gentle demeanour. When Jane Goodall began observing and studying chimpanzees in Gombe Stream National Park in Tanzania, she was a trailblazer. Her research, now considered groundbreaking, was controversial.",
      "She was the first person to witness and document chimpanzees making and using tools \u2013 the primates prepared sticks to fish for termites. Prior to her observations, that was a trait that was thought to be uniquely human.",
      "She revealed that the animals form strong family bonds - and even that they engage in warfare over territory.",
      "But her approach \u2013 associating so closely with the animals she studied, naming them and even referring to them as \u201cmy friends\u201d was scoffed at by some (mostly male) scientists.",
      "Her supervisor and mentor, Professor Louis Leakey, though, saw the value in her technique: \u201cHe wanted somebody whose mind wasn't messed up by the reductionist attitude of science to animals,\u201d Dr Goodall explains.",
      "\u201cYou don't have a dog, a cat, a rabbit, a horse and not give them a name. It's the same as when I studied squirrels in my garden as a little girl - they all had names.\u201d",
      "Her methods \u2013 and her sense of closeness to the primates she has dedicated her life to \u2013 have given her a unique perspective.",
      "She tells me about a \u201cwonderful moment\u201d with a chimpanzee she named David Greybeard, the male chimp who she first witnessed making and using tools to catch termites. \u201cHe was the first to lose his fear of me,\u201d she recalls.",
      "\u201cI sat down near him and, lying on the ground, was the ripe red fruit of an oil palm. I held it out towards him and he turned his head away. Then I put my hand closer and he turned and looked into my eyes, reached out and very gently squeezed my fingers.",
      "\u201cThat is how chimpanzees reassure each other. We understood each other perfectly - with a gestural language that obviously predates human speech.\u201d",
      "\u2018We need to get tougher\u2019",
      "Dr Goodall\u2019s career has often been challenging. She has written about the early years of her work for Professor Leakey, who was a renowned scientist, and who had enormous influence over her career. He repeatedly declared his love for her, putting pressure on her in a way that, today, might be viewed as sexual harassment.",
      "But she spurned his advances and kept her focus on her work and her beloved chimpanzees. Now, having turned 90 this year, she does not appear to be slowing down.",
      "So what keeps Dr Goodall going? On this she is emphatic \u2013 charmingly affronted by the question: \"Surely people want a future for their children. If they do, we have to get tougher about [environmental] legislation.",

      "The sighting was unusual because the beluga was so tame and they're rarely seen as far south. It was also wearing a harness, which had a mount for a camera, and bore the words, in English, \u201cEquipment St Petersburg\u201d.",
      "Mr Hesten helped to remove the harness from the whale, which then swam to the nearby port of Hammerfest, where it lived for several months.",
      "Seemingly unable to catch live fish to eat, it charmed visitors by nudging at their cameras and even on one occasion returning a mobile phone.",
      "\u201cIt was very obvious that this particular whale had been conditioned to be putting his nose on anything that looked like a target because he was doing it each time,\u201d says Eve Jourdain, a researcher from the Norwegian Orca Survey.",
      "\u201cBut we have no idea what kind of facility he was in, so we don\u2019t know what he was trained for.\u201d",
      "Captivated by the whale's story Norway made arrangements for the beluga to be monitored and fed. The name it was given \u2013 Hvaldimir - is a nod to hval which is Norwegian for whale, and the name of Russia's President, Vladimir Putin.",
      "Dr Shpak did not want to name her sources in Russia for their own safety but said she had been told that when the beluga surfaced in Norway, the Russian marine mammal community immediately identified it as one of theirs.",
      "\u201cThrough the chain of vets and trainers the message came back \u2013 that they were missing a beluga called Andruha,\u201d she says.",
      "According to Dr Shpak, Andruha/Hvaldimir had first been captured in 2013 in the Sea of Okhotsk in Russia's Far East. A year later it was moved from a facility owned by a dolphinarium in St Petersburg to the military programme in the Russian Arctic, where his trainers and vets remained in contact.",
      "\u201cI believe that when they started to work in open water, trusting this animal (not to swim away), the animal just gave up on them,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cWhat I've heard from the guys at the commercial dolphinarium who used to have him was that Andruha was smart, so a good choice to be trained. But at the same time, he was kind of like a hooligan - an active beluga - so they were not surprised that he gave up on (following) the boat and went where he wanted to.\u201d",
      "Satellite images from near the Russian naval base in Murmansk show what could have been Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s old home. Pens can clearly be seen in the water with what appear to be white whales inside.",
      "\u201cThe location of the beluga whales very close to the submarines and the surface vessels might tell us that they are actually part of a guarding system,\u201d says Thomas Nilsen, from Norwegian online newspaper The Barents Observer.",
      "Russia, for its part, has never officially addressed the claim that Hvaldimir/Andruha was trained by its army. But it does have a long history of training marine mammals for military purposes.",
      "Speaking in 2019, a Russian reserve colonel, Viktor Baranets, said: \"If we were using this animal for spying, do you really think we'd attach a mobile phone number with the message 'Please call this number'?\"",
      "Sadly, Hvaldimir/Andruha\u2019s incredible story does not have a happy ending.",
      "Having learned to feed himself, it spent several years travelling south along Norway\u2019s coast and in May 2023 was even spotted off the coast of Sweden.",
      "Then on September 1 2024 its body was found floating at sea, near the town of Risavika, on Norway's south-western coast.",
      "Had the long arm of Putin\u2019s Russia caught up with the reluctant beluga?",
      "It appears not. Despite some activist groups suggesting that the whale had been shot, that explanation has been dismissed by the Norwegian police.",
      "They say there was nothing to suggest that human activity directly caused the beluga\u2019s death. A post-mortem examination revealed that Hvaldimir/Andruha died after a stick became lodged in his mouth."

      "But while the authors of this letter recognise these achievements, they feel that the slow-moving COP process is \u201cno longer fit for purpose\u201d in dealing with a fast-moving climate crisis.",
      "\"Its current structure simply cannot deliver the change at exponential speed and scale, which is essential to ensure a safe climate landing for humanity,\" said its signatories.

    "story": [
      "You may have seen the word \"Bluesky\" popping up on your social media pages recently and wondered what people are talking about.",
      "It is an alternative platform to Elon Musk's X and in terms of its colour and logo, it looks quite similar.",
      "Bluesky is growing rapidly and is currently picking up around one million new sign-ups a day.",
      "It had 16.7m users at the time of writing, but that figure will likely be outdated by the time you read this.",
      "So what is it - and why are so many people joining?",
      "What is Bluesky?",
      "Bluesky describes itself as \"social media as it should be\", although it looks similar to other sites.",
      "Visually, a bar to the left of the page shows everything you might expect - search, notifications, a homepage and so on.",
      "People using the platform can post, comment, repost and like their favourite things.",
      "To put it simply, it looks how X, formerly known as Twitter, used to look.",
      "The main difference is Bluesky is decentralised - a complicated term which basically means users can host their data on servers other than those owned by the company.",
      "This means that rather than being limited to having a specific account named after Bluesky, people can (if they like) sign up using an account they themselves own.",
      "But it is worth stating that the vast majority of people don't do that and a new joiner will most likely have a \".bsky.social\" at the end of their username.",
      "Who owns Bluesky?",
      "If you think it feels a lot like X, you won't be surprised to learn why. The former head of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, created it.",
      "He even once said he wanted Bluesky to be a decentralised version of Twitter that no single person or entity owns.",
      "But Mr Dorsey is no longer part of the team behind it, having stepped down from the board in May 2024.",
      "He deleted his account altogether in September.",
      "It is now run and predominantly owned by chief executive Jay Graber as a US public benefit corporation.",
      "Why is it gaining in popularity?",
      "Bluesky has been around since 2019, but it was invitation-only until February of this year.",
      "That let the developers deal with all the kinks behind-the-scenes, to try and stabilise it before opening the doors to the wider public.",
      "The plan has worked, somewhat. But the flurry of new users has been so significant in November that there continue to be issues with outages.",
      "It is no coincidence that the number of new Bluesky users spiked following Donald Trump's success in the US elections in November.",
      "X's owner, Mr Musk, was a big backer of Trump during his campaign, and will be heavily involved in his administration.",
      "Inevitably, this has led to a political division, with some people leaving X in protest.",
      "But others have cited different reasons, such as the Guardian newspaper which has chosen to stop posting there as it called X \"a toxic media platform\".",
      "Meanwhile, Bluesky's app continues to pick up significant downloads worldwide and on Thursday was the top free app in the Apple App Store in the UK.",
      "Several celebrities, from pop singer Lizzo to Taskmaster's Greg Davies, have announced they are joining the platform and limiting their use of - or in some cases leaving altogether - X.",
      "Other names you might recognise include Ben Stiller, Jamie Lee Curtis and Patton Oswalt.",
      "But this growth, while significant, will have to continue for a long time before Bluesky is able to mount a true challenge to its microblogging rival.",
      "X does not share its total user numbers but it is understood to be measured in the hundreds of millions, with Elon Musk previously saying the platform had 250 million users each day.",
      "How does Bluesky make money?",
      "It is the million dollar question, quite literally.",
      "Bluesky started off with funding from investors and venture capital firms and has raised tens of millions of dollars through these means.",
      "But with so many new users, it is going to have to find a way to pay the bills.",
      "Back in Twitter's heyday, the site made the vast majority of its money through advertising.",
      "Bluesky has said it wants to avoid this. Instead, it said it will continue to look into paid services, such as having people pay for custom domains in their username.",
      "That sounds complicated but it basically comes down to a person's username being even more personalised.",
      "For example, it may mean my username - @twgerken.bsky.social - could in the future be more official-sounding, such as @twgerken.bbc.co.uk.",
      "Proponents of this idea say it doubles-up as a form of verification as the organisation which owns the website would have to clear its use.",
      "If Bluesky's owners continue to avoid advertising, they may inevitably have to look to other broader options, such as subscription features, as a way of keeping the lights on.",
      "But if it is not making very much money, that would not be unusual for tech startups.",
      "In fact, Twitter, before it was purchased by Mr Musk in 2022, only made a profit twice in its eight years of being publicly traded.",
      "And we all know how that ended - a massive payday for investors when the world's richest man paid $44bn (\u00a334.7bn) for the privilege of owning it.",
      "For now, the future of Bluesky remains unknown, but if its growth continues, anything is possible.",

      "Alan Davis, from law firm Pinsent Masons, said there were very likely to be more, similar cases in the future.",

      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",

      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",

      "Trump himself has not commented, but he won the election after promising to end the war - and several people close to him have condemned the move as dangerous escalation.",
      "Biden has committed tens of billions of dollars to Kyiv's war effort, and at the weekend he reportedly ditched a long-standing red line on Ukraine's use of American weaponry to launch attacks deep into Russia.",
      "Donald Trump Jr tweeted that the president was trying to \"get World War Three going\" before his father took office.",
      "Biden's decision has not been formally confirmed and it may never be.",
      "When asked about how typical it would be for a presidential administration to take such a significant policy decision in its final months, State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said that Biden was \"elected to a four year-term, not a term of three years and 10 months.\"",
      "\"We will use every day of our term to pursue policy interests that we believe are in the interests of the American people,\" he said. \"If the incoming administration wants to take a different view, that is, of course, their right to do so.\"",
      "\"There's one president at a time,\" he added. \"When the next president takes office, he can make his own decisions.\"",

      "James Gilmore, who served as Trump's ambassador to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, told the BBC that the main issue with Biden's decision to provide Ukraine this new capability is that it came so late in the war.",

      "Senator JD Vance, who will be Trump's vice-president, has regularly objected to providing arms to Ukraine. He argued that the US lacks the manufacturing capacity to continue providing weapons like the missile systems that Kyiv will use to strike within Russia.",
      "Gilmore, however, said the US was able to backfill and upgrade its weapon systems through this process, but he said the US's European allies would need to take on a bigger role.",
      "\"President Trump is exactly right about this - the alliance is stronger when Western European countries step up to the plate,\" he said. \"The United States cannot continue to act alone. The taxpayer won't permit it, the next administration won't permit it, and I wouldn't, either.\"",

      "At times, Putin has mooted the possibility of using nuclear weapons, too.",

      "A convoy of 109 UN aid lorries carrying food was violently looted in Gaza on Saturday, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) says.",
      "Ninety-seven of the lorries were lost and their drivers were forced at gunpoint to unload their aid after passing through the Israeli-controlled Kerem Shalom crossing with southern Gaza, in what is believed to have been one of the worst incidents of its kind.",
      "Eyewitnesses said the convoy was attacked by masked men who threw grenades.",
      "Unrwa commissioner general Philippe Lazzarini did not identify the perpetrators, but he said the \u201ctotal breakdown of civil order\u201d in Gaza meant it had \u201cbecome an impossible environment to operate in\u201d.",
      "Without immediate intervention, severe food shortages are set to worsen for the two million people depending on humanitarian aid to survive, according to Unrwa.",
      "A UN-backed assessment warned earlier this month that there was \u201cstrong likelihood that famine is imminent in areas within the northern Gaza Strip\u201d.",
      "It came after Israeli forces launched a major ground offensive in the north and the UN said fewer aid lorries had entered Gaza last month than at any time since the start of the war between Israel and Hamas in October 2023.",
      "Saturday\u2019s looting was first reported by Reuters news agency, which cited an Unrwa official in Gaza as saying that the convoy was instructed by Israeli authorities to \"depart at short notice via an unfamiliar route\" from Kerem Shalom.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run interior ministry said its security staff killed \"more than 20 members of gangs involved in stealing aid trucks\" in an operation carried out in cooperation with \"tribal committees\", a network of traditional family clans.",
      "Lazzarini said he could not comment on the route when asked at a news conference in Geneva on Monday, but he confirmed the looting and said: \u201cWe have been warning a long time ago about the total breakdown of civil order.\u201d",
      "\u201cUntil four or five months ago, we still had local capacity, people who were escorting the convoy. This has completely gone, which means we are in an environment where local gangs, local families, are struggling among each other to take control of any business or any activities taking place in the south. It has become an impossible environment to operate in.\u201d",
      "He added that hundreds of people desperate for food had tried to storm the Unrwa-run vocational centre in the southern city of Khan Younis because they thought the aid had been delivered there.",
      "\u201cBut the convoys were looted and there was absolutely nothing to take from the warehouses.\u201d",

      "HRW accuses Israel of war crime of forced displacement in Gaza",
      "US says Israel hasn't breached its law against blocking aid in Gaza",
      "Earlier, the Israeli military body responsible for humanitarian affairs in the Gaza Strip, Cogat, said on X: \u201cWith the challenges the UN aid organisations experience in distributing aid, we are working together on various measures that will facilitate the transfer of aid from the Kerem Shalom crossing to Gazans in need.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor months now, aid has been piling up on the Gazan side, after Israeli inspection, waiting for collection and distribution, and we've been taking many measures to assist with the pick-up of aid,\u201d it added.",
      "Israel has previously insisted there are no limits to the amount of aid that can be delivered into and across Gaza, and accused Hamas of stealing aid, which the group has denied.",
      "Last week, a group of 29 non-governmental organisations said in a report that the looting of aid convoys was \u201ca consequence of Israel's targeting of the remaining police forces in Gaza, scarcity of essential goods, lack of routes and closure of most crossing points, and the subsequent desperation of the population amid these dire conditions\u201d.",
      "They cited media reports as saying that \u201cmany incidents are taking place close by or in full view of Israeli forces, without them intervening, even when truck drivers asked for assistance\u201d.",
      "Also on Monday, Palestinian authorities said Israeli strikes had killed more than 30 people across Gaza.",
      "At least 17 were reportedly killed when a house was hit near Kamal Adwan hospital in the Beit Lahia Project, in northern Gaza.",

      "Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of congressman Matt Gaetz to be his attorney general has arrived like a thunderclap in Washington.",
      "Of all the president-elect\u2019s picks for his administration so far, this is easily the most controversial - and sends a clear message that Trump intends to shake up the establishment when he returns to power.",
      "The shockwaves were still being felt on Thursday morning as focus shifted to a looming fight in the Senate over his nomination.",
      "Trump is assembling his team before he begins his term on 20 January, and his choice of defence secretary, Fox News host Pete Hegseth, and intelligence chief, former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, have also raised eyebrows.",
      "But it is Gaetz making most headlines. The Florida firebrand is perhaps best known for spearheading the effort to unseat then-Republican Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy last year. But he has a history of being a flamethrower in the staid halls of Congress.",
      "In 2018, he brought a right-wing Holocaust denier to the State of the Union, and later tried to expel two fathers who lost children in a mass shooting from a hearing after they objected to a claim he made about gun control.",
      "His bombastic approach means he has no shortage of enemies, including within his own party. And so Trump's choice of Gaetz for this crucial role is a signal to those Republicans, too - his second administration will be staffed by loyalists who he trusts to enact his agenda, conventional political opinion be damned.",

      "All this makes him an unlikely choice for a position that typically goes to more senior politicians, well versed in law.",
      "Gaetz, 42, has a law degree and worked for a Florida law firm before his eight years in Congress. Joe Biden\u2019s attorney general, Merrick Garland, was a senior federal appellate court judge. Trump in his first term picked US Senator Jeff Sessions, and later Bill Barr, who had decades of experience in Republican presidential administrations.",
      "The Senate will be responsible for confirming Gaetz\u2019s nomination, and the Florida congressman has ruffled more then a few feathers in that chamber \u2013 including among Republicans. While his party has a majority, it would only take four \u201cno\u201d votes, joined by unified Democratic opposition, to sink his chances.",
      "Gaetz himself said last year that he would love to be attorney general while acknowledging it was unlikely.",
      "\u201cThe world is not ready, probably,\u201d he told Newsmax in an interview. \u201cCertainly Senate confirmation wouldn\u2019t be, but you know, a boy can dream.\u201d",
      "For the moment, however, Trump\u2019s closest supporters are celebrating his pick.",
      "\u201cThe hammer of justice is coming,\u201d Elon Musk posted about Gaetz on X.",
      "Regardless of the ultimate outcome of Gaetz\u2019s bid to be attorney general, Trump has fired a warning shot across the bow of US government. While his second term in office may be more organised than his first, it may end up being even more confrontational.",

    "story": [
      "For now, Mike Huckabee seems to be keeping his cards close to his chest.",
      "Shortly after being announced as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for US ambassador to Israel, the former Republican governor of Arkansas said: \u201cI won't make the policy. I will carry out the policy of the president.\u201d",
      "But he did give an indication of what he expected that policy to be, citing the previous Trump administration\u2019s decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem and to recognise the occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory \u2013 decisions as warmly welcomed by the Israeli right wing as they were categorically rejected by Palestinians.",
      "\u201cNo-one has done more,\u201d he told an Israeli radio station. \u201cPresident Trump and I fully expect that will continue.\u201d",
      "What approach Trump will take to the Israel-Gaza war is still unclear. But the right wing of Israeli politics has welcomed the president-elect\u2019s appointment of Huckabee, seeing it as predicting another term of American policy highly favourable to their longstanding aims of holding on to territory in the West Bank and expanding settlements.",
      "The appointment was greeted with joy by two far-right ministers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government. On the social media platform X, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich messaged his congratulations to \u201ca consistent and loyal friend\", while Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister, wrote \"Mike Huckabee\" with heart emojis.",

      "Trump picking Gaetz to head justice department stuns - but sends strong message",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have reason to be cheered by Huckabee\u2019s appointment. He has been a consistent supporter of many Israelis\u2019 ambitions to expand into territories that would form part of any future Palestinian state.",
      "Holding a press conference in 2017, shortly after a cornerstone-laying ceremony at one of the biggest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, Huckabee said: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a settlement. They\u2019re communities, they\u2019re neighbourhoods, they\u2019re cities.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an occupation.\u201d",
      "The following year, he said: \u201cI think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the name used by many in Israel for the area which became the occupied West Bank when it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.",
      "The previous Trump administration declared in 2019 that it did not consider Israeli settlements illegal under international law, contradicting decades of US policy. Other decisions, including a 2020 peace plan greenlighting the annexation of Israeli settlements, were seen as more favourable to the settlers than any previous administration.",
      "The Israeli far right has indicated that it sees Huckabee\u2019s appointment as a sign that it will be able to further advance its agenda, including annexation of the West Bank, during the next Trump term.",
      "On Monday, Smotrich said that 2025 would be \"the year of sovereignty\" in the West Bank, adding that he had instructed Israeli authorities to begin preparatory work for annexation of the occupied territory.",
      "That happening is a genuine fear for Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based veteran Palestinian politician who is leader of the Palestinian National Initiative political movement.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the reaction of other powerful countries in the world would be, when the idea of annexing occupied territories, obtained by war, becomes legal and acceptable,\" he says. \"So it's not just about Palestinians and our suffering, it's about the international order.\u201d",
      "Whether Smotrich will get his wish remains to be seen. Tal Schneider, a political correspondent at the Times of Israel, says it is not a foregone conclusion that a pro-settler US ambassador will result in pro-settler policies in Washington.",
      "\u201cFour years ago, some of the people that surrounded Trump were very much pro-settlements and pro-annexing, but it didn't work like that last time. I predict it's not going to work like that this time around.\u201d",
      "Huckabee was not the only appointee announced on Tuesday. The president-elect also said Steve Witkoff would serve as his special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "As well as being a real estate developer, Witkoff is also a longtime golf buddy of Trump\u2019s. The pair were playing together at the time of a second failed assassination attempt in September.",
      "It is not clear what foreign policy experience Witkoff brings to the role, but he has previously praised Trump\u2019s dealings with Israel.",
      "In July, he argued that Trump\u2019s \u201cleadership was good for Israel and the entire region\u201d.",
      "\u201cWith President Trump, the Middle East experienced historic levels of peace and stability. Strength prevents wars. Iran\u2019s money was cut off which prevented their funding of global terror,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s decision to nominate a hardline settler leader for Israeli ambassador to Washington three days after Trump\u2019s election also indicates that the prime minister believes the next administration will be receptive to right-wing arguments.",
      "US-born Yechiel Leiter, who was Netanyahu\u2019s chief of staff when he was finance minister, supports the annexation of the West Bank. According to the Haaretz newspaper, he was once active in the US-based Jewish Defence League, the organisation founded by far-right rabbi Meir Kahane. His son was killed fighting in Gaza.",
      "He was also reported to support the Abraham Accords, Trump\u2019s efforts to normalise relations between Israel and Arab states, which had some success. However, advancing that process has been derailed by the ongoing war in Gaza and Arab anger over the suffering of the Palestinians.",
      "Palestinians, already disillusioned with the US over Joe Biden\u2019s support for Israel during the war in Gaza, say Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador suggests the next president will make the prospect of an eventual two-state solution to the Israel-Palestinian conflict even more remote.",
      "\u201cMr Huckabee has said things that are absolutely contradictory to international law,\u201d says Mustafa Barghouti, a West Bank-based Palestinian politician.",

      "Donald Trump has moved speedily since winning the US presidential election to set the foundations of his second term in the White House.",
      "He has made his early priorities clear - and stunned some in Washington and around the world while doing so.",
      "Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned from his rollercoaster first week as president-elect.",
      "1) He\u2019s building a loyal team to shake up government",
      "Trump started building his top team almost immediately, nominating cabinet picks for Senate approval and appointing White House advisers and other senior aides.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t tell the full story.",
      "His selections make clear that he plans a radical shake up of government, eschewing more conventional and experienced picks for those who are loyal to him and share his vision for a second term that will upend the status quo in Washington.",
      "His choice for defence secretary, for example, has called for a purge of military chiefs enacting \u201cwoke\u201d policies. His nominee for health secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has said he wants to \u201cclear out corruption\u201d at America\u2019s health agencies and cut \u201centire departments\u201d at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).",
      "And that\u2019s not to mention a promised \u201cDepartment of Government Efficiency\u201c helmed by advisers Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, which Trump says will focus on slashing regulations and historic cost-cutting.",
      "The bigger picture is that Trump\u2019s proposed team is almost universally loyal, and favour overhauling their respective government departments.",
      "You can take a deeper look at who\u2019s in the frame for his top team here.",
      "2) He\u2019ll have a friendly Congress on his side",
      "Republicans have won control of the House as well as the Senate, giving the party a crucial (albeit narrow) majority in both chambers for at least the next two years, when there will be the usual midterm elections.",
      "This is a major boost to Trump\u2019s agenda. It means he will be more easily able to pass legislation and gives his policy priorities a friendly path to becoming law.",
      "The Democratic Party will, naturally, be less able to block and resist his agenda too. And Trump should for now be able to avoid the kind of congressional investigations he faced in the second half of his first term.",
      "Ultimately, Republican control of Congress could prove key in pushing through his big pledges such as mass deportations, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "It won\u2019t always be smooth sailing for Trump in Congress, however, as our correspondent Gary O\u2019Donoghue explains here.",
      "3) But Senate Republicans won\u2019t always roll over",
      "Trump\u2019s influence was put to the test earlier this week when Republicans in the Senate picked their new leader.",
      "While he did not weigh-in on the race directly, there had been a concerted effort from the president-elect\u2019s most vocal allies as well as favourable \u2018Maga\u2019 media outlets to get hard-line Trump loyalist Rick Scott elected.",
      "But he was defeated in the first round and Republicans opted for a more orthodox pick in John Thune, who has had a more rocky relationship with Trump.",
      "It\u2019s worth noting that this was a secret ballot, so it was far from a public repudiation of Trumpworld.",
      "There will be sterner tests of Trump\u2019s power on Capitol Hill to come, notably when confirmation hearings are held for his more divisive cabinet picks.",
      "Some Senate Republicans, for example, have already signalled their opposition to Trump's shock choice of Matt Gaetz to lead the justice department.",
      "4) Trump's criminal conviction could soon be wiped",
      "While much of the focus was on the president-elect\u2019s nominations and appointments, we also had a reminder that his legal troubles have been upended by his victory.",
      "In New York specifically, his criminal fraud conviction in the hush-money case lives on for at least a few more days.",
      "But it could soon be consigned to history. Earlier this week a judge delayed his decision as to whether Trump\u2019s conviction should be thrown out because of a Supreme Court ruling in the summer that expanded presidential immunity.",
      "That decision is now expected to come next week. And while it\u2019s not clear whether the conviction will be tossed out, Trump\u2019s scheduled sentencing on 26 November is likely to be delayed regardless.",
      "Here\u2019s a reminder of how Trump\u2019s election win impacts his cases.",
      "What are recess appointments and how will Trump administration picks be vetted?",
      "Trump's pick of Huckabee and Witkoff a clue to Middle East policy",
      "Trump picking Gaetz to head justice sends shockwaves - and a strong message",
      "Who has joined Trump's team so far?",
      "5) He has China firmly in his sights",
      "It\u2019s no secret that Trump views the world differently to Biden, and could drastically shift US foreign policy over the next few years.",
      "One clear theme that's emerged in recent days is the prominence of China hawks in his proposed team - those who believe Beijing poses a serious threat to US economic and military dominance and want to challenge this more forcefully.",
      "And they are present from the top down.",
      "His nomination for secretary of state - America\u2019s most senior diplomat - Marco Rubio, has described China as the \u201cmost advanced adversary America has ever faced\u201d.",
      "Mike Waltz, his national security adviser, has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China. Other nominees such as his proposed ambassador to the UN, Elise Stefanik, have directly accused China of election interference.",
      "During Trump\u2019s first administration, relations with Beijing were tense, and they barely warmed under Biden. With tariffs, export controls and pointed rhetoric, the president-elect appears ready to take an even tougher stance this time around."

      "On election night, Donald Trump repeated the phrase: \"Promises made, promises kept.\"",
      "Now, Republicans have officially taken control of Congress and his \"promises\" are a whole lot easier to keep.",
      "In Washington political parlance, it's called \"a governing trifecta\", when the president's party also controls both chambers of Congress - the House of Representatives and the Senate.",
      "That control is what Donald Trump's Republican Party now has.",
      "Single-party control was once common, but in recent decades it has become rarer and shorter.  Often, the party in power loses seats when midterm congressional elections roll around two years later.",

      "When does he become president again?",
      "Who has Trump appointed to his top team so far?",
      "Why is Elon Musk Trump's efficiency tsar?",
      "In his first two years, Trump passed a signature tax bill - reducing corporate taxes from 35% to 21%, and cutting some taxes on individuals.",
      "But with some members of his own party resistant to his surprise ascent to the top in 2016, he struggled with other aims.",
      "His plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) failed when a senator from his own party, John McCain, refused to vote for it. He also failed to pass an infrastructure bill as he had promised.",
      "In his first two years, when the Democrats controlled the House and the Senate, Biden succeeded in passing the American Rescue plan, the Investment and Jobs Act, and the Chips and Science Act. But he, too, had to significantly scale back his spending and investment plans - touted as the Build Back Better package - after opposition from one of his own senators.",
      "A major impediment to total control for either party is that Senate bills require a three-fifths majority, or 60 votes, to bypass the filibuster, which enables senators to delay legislation by keeping debate open-ended. That means that when a party has a simple majority in the Senate, it needs to reach across the aisle to get a bill passed.",
      "Even with a healthy majority in the Senate this time around, Trump will not have the magic 60 seats that would allow him to overcome opposition attempts to delay legislation.",
      "And on Wednesday, Republicans in the Senate selected John Thune as their majority leader over Florida's Rick Scott, the clear favourite in the Trump camp, in a sign some lawmakers may be reasserting their independence (Trump did not officially endorse Scott).",
      "That said, a trifecta, if astutely managed, does open the way for the possibility of major legislative initiatives.",
      "Trump's power advantage could be key in pushing through his big promises such as the largest deportation of migrants in history, sweeping tariffs on foreign imports, and the rolling back of environmental protections.",
      "Using legislation to achieve these ends will make such plans much harder to overturn in the courts - something Donald Trump was plagued by in his first term when he extensively used executive orders that were regularly and often successfully challenged.",
      "The judicial landscape also has changed in Trump's favour.",
      "The signature achievement of his first term was putting three conservatives on the Supreme Court - cementing a two-thirds majority for possibly decades to come.",
      "He also named more than four dozen judges to the federal appeals courts, flipping several circuits to a more conservative bent.",
      "The majority Republicans have in the Senate also provides a key advantage.",
      "Trump will be able to get his nominees for administration posts approved more easily, something he struggled with back in 2017 when internal resistance to him in the Republican Party was still significant.",
      "All this bodes for a busy and possibly turbulent next two years. But, as recent history indicates, these trifectas don't last all that long. The incoming administration will want to get a move on.",

      "Though some of the Republican president-elect's personnel decisions are immediate, many must go through further vetting.",
      "Several of the posts require a Senate hearing and a majority of the chamber's approval.",

      "These hearings can sometimes be contentious. They allow members from both political parties to question nominees about their backgrounds and plans for the post.",
      "After the hearing, the committee votes on the nomination. If it approves the candidate, the full Senate then votes on the nominee.",
      "Historically, the upper chamber has approved cabinet positions quickly - sometimes with little or no debate. But \"political and partisan conflicts between the president and senators have at times produced dramatic fights over cabinet nominees and led to their ultimate withdrawal or rejection\", the Senate's historical website notes.",
      "Bitter political brawls over Trump's picks could be limited somewhat because Republicans will control both chambers of Congress when the president-elect takes office in January.",

      "The vetting and approval process for nominees can be lengthy, but it was included in the US Constitution to provide a check on presidential power. It is also designed to rule out corrupt or unqualified nominees.",
      "There is, however, an exception to this process - recess appointments - which Trump appears intent to use to ensure his appointments are able to take office.",
      "Basically, the process says that when Congress is in recess - meaning it's not in session for a duration of time - the president can make appointments temporarily without congressional approval or vetting.",
      "Sen Thune warned on Fox that while recess appointments are an option for nominees, it is also not a certainty. First, all senators would need to vote to recess, he said, adding that the same senators with concerns about a nominee might also oppose a recess.",
      "The recess process was created when Congress didn't meet as often as it does today, and was to be used in emergencies so presidents would be able to fill positions without delay.",
      "It is also supposed to be a temporary appointment and expires at the end of a congressional session - so at most, one year.",
      "Trump recently said the Senate \"must agree\" to recess appointments, otherwise \"we will not be able to get people confirmed in a timely manner\". He noted that in his past administration, some of his nominees took multiple years to be confirmed.",
      "Trump's plan to use recess appointments, along with the announcement that Republican senators' support bypassing the Senate vetting process, is not without precedent.",

      "When can Trump make recess appointments?",
      "According to Professor Chafetz, there are two paths Trump could take to making recess appointments.",
      "The first would involve the Senate agreeing to recess for 10 days or more by majority vote.",
      "The second would involve the House voting for a longer recess than the Senate, which would allow Trump to invoke a never-used constitutional power to adjourn both chambers of Congress.",
      "According to the US Constitution, \"in Case of Disagreement\" a president can adjourn both chambers of Congress until \"such Time as he shall think proper\" - which would then provide Trump an opportunity to make recess appointments.",
      "Trump previously threatened to use this power when he was in the White House.",
      "In 2020, during a pandemic briefing, Trump said that he would \"exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of Congress\u201d to make recess appointments if his nominees before Congress were not approved.",
      "Professor Chafetz stressed that this route has never been used before in US history, and so \"no-one is quite sure how it would work\".",
      "He added that Trump cannot make any recess appointments until he is president. His inauguration is scheduled for 20 January.",
      "If Trump wishes for the Senate to recess for a period longer than 10 days, he would require the unanimous consent of all 100 lawmakers.",
      "But the chamber includes 47 Democrats, all or most of whom will vote to block the change.",
      "In order to override that blockade, Republicans need a 60-vote majority, which means winning support from all 53 of their members and at least seven Democrats.",
      "With Republicans unlikely to reach that threshold, they will be faced with rolling back a procedural tool known as the filibuster. Incoming Senate Majority Leader John Thune, like his predecessor Mitch McConnell, has already indicated he does not support setting such a precedent.",

      "Second-term priorities take shape",
      "Musk told a Trump rally in October that he believed the US government's budget could be cut by \"at least\" $2tn from about $6.5tn. He has also frequently suggested the number of government employees could be significantly reduced.",
      "Ramaswamy, meanwhile, has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.",
      "Railing against regulation",
      "Musk has cast his plans to optimise government efficiency in heroic terms, pointing to his hopes of one day colonising Mars, while arguing that the feat would only be possible \"so long as it is not smothered by bureaucracy\".",
      "At the time, he said creating the new Doge was \"the only path to extending life beyond Earth\".",
      "Any major cuts to government agencies could also have potentially significant implications for his business interests, which are closely entwined with the government.",
      "Rocket firm SpaceX alone has more than $8bn-worth of ongoing contracts with the US government, according to public contracting sites, and could stand to benefit further from closer government ties.",
      "Meanwhile, his electric car company Tesla is facing investigations from numerous government agencies over issues such as the safety of its self-driving features. His desire to cut regulation could affect such probes.",
      "In recent years, Musk has repeatedly accused regulators of launching trivial probes and standing in the way of his companies.",
      "In September he threatened to sue the Federal Aviation Administration over its plans to fine his SpaceX company $633,000 for alleged licence infringements related to some of its rocket launches from Cape Canaveral in Florida. He accused the agency of \"regulatory overreach\".",
      "Musk \"stands to benefit personally from a lot of the deregulation that he touts,\" says Christopher Phelps, a professor of modern US political history, adding: \"I think putting someone who is a billionaire and runs major corporations in charge of a federal project of deregulation is innately full of conflicts of interest.\"",
      "Others said Musk, who has long described himself as having a libertarian bent, appeared to be a true believer in the benefits of smaller government.",
      "\"There\u2019s no doubt that Musk has significant vested interests in the US regulatory landscape as a result of his many business enterprises,\" says Thomas Gift, a political science professor and director of the Centre on US Politics at University College London.",
      "\"At the same time, it\u2019s hard to make the case that this is the only impetus driving him.",
      "\"Musk has undertaken huge personal and political risks in coming out for Trump, and many of his activities and rhetoric seem to reflect an individual ideologically committed to causes he believes in.\"",
      "\"Clearly he has got skin in the game and there\u2019s a self-interest, but equally you can have a sincere belief that there is too much government regulation and too much government bureaucracy,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Reward for loyalty",
      "For years, Musk did not play a big role in politics, despite his large fortune, now worth more than $300bn, according to Forbes estimates.",
      "But he spoke out against the pandemic lockdowns of 2020. His criticism of the Biden administration mounted after the White House did not invite Tesla to an electric car summit in 2021.",
      "He formally endorsed Trump this year after an assassination attempt, ultimately donating more than $100m (\u00a379m) to Trump's 2024 presidential campaign and appearing at numerous rallies.",
      "Prof Phelps describes Musk's relationship with Trump as \"transactional\", adding that the new role \"gives him a lot of symbolic clout - and possibly the clout to get the things that matter most to him done\".",
      "As the South African-born billionaire is not a US citizen by birth, Musk cannot become president - something that has frustrated other famous faces who became involved in politics in the past.",
      "But he can have an influence on US policy, and Trump will have a sympathetic adviser to call upon.",
      "\"Trump is looking to surround himself with loyalists in his new administration, and there\u2019s no-one who\u2019s been more loyal than Musk since he announced his endorsement for Trump,\" says Prof Gift.",
      "\"Not only did Musk go 'all in' in supporting Trump personally and financially during the campaign, but he\u2019s also evolved into a trusted adviser on topics as diverse as technology policy to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "In an early sign of the influence the tech entrepreneur may be rewarded with for his loyalty, Musk was party to a call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following the election. The war in Ukraine will be a major foreign policy concern when Trump takes office.",
      "\"That is actually quite extraordinary,\" says Prof Waddan. \"Normally, even your biggest donors wouldn\u2019t get that kind of access.\"",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Musk first raised the idea of a cost-cutting effort while hosting Trump on X this summer. The official name is a winking reference to a meme featuring a Shiba Inu dog, which then gave its name to the cryptocurrency Dogecoin, a favourite of Musk that has seen its value soar since the election.",
      "Prof Phelps says the name is \"a nod to crypto deregulation being part of what they\u2019ll do\".",
      "But it is not clear how much of Musk's talk of cutting might actually become reality.",
      "For one thing, the new department will not have an official role, but provide \"advice and guidance from outside government\", according to the announcement.",
      "Experts have also warned that cuts of the scale discussed could be enormously disruptive - and face pushback in Congress - depending on how rapidly they are implemented.",
      "Musk himself acknowledged the risks, saying Americans should be ready to stomach temporary hardship for long-run gain.",
      "The way he has run his own firms may hint at what Americans can expect.",
      "After his October 2022 takeover of the social media platform Twitter - which he branded as X - Musk introduced radical changes, including the reduction X's workforce from around 8,000 to 1,500 in a matter of weeks.",
      "\"His idea of efficiency was to let a lot of people go,\" says Alex Waddan, a professor of US politics at the University of Leicester.",
      "Musk also loosened content moderation, stopped verifying accounts and welcomed users back to the platform who had been banned for violating its rules on hate speech and disinformation.",
      "Among the users he reinstated was Trump, who had been banned following the Capitol riot in January 2021 after continuing to claim the 2020 election had been rigged against him.",
      "Critics argue his changes have given prominence to hate-speech and misinformation - though Musk maintains the site is politically neutral.",
      "The overhaul also prompted an exodus of advertisers - the main way the site has made money. Though Musk has introduced new ways to raise revenue, such as paid subscriptions, the company today is worth far less than the $44bn Musk paid for it just two years ago.",
      "His record at his other big companies - Tesla and SpaceX - is stronger.",
      "Among car companies, Tesla stands out for making electric vehicles at a large profit, thanks in part to streamlined operations. His rocket firm SpaceX is credited with enabling rocket launches at significantly lower cost.",
      "\"As a serial entrepreneur, Musk has been relentless in trying to improve institutional efficiency at his own enterprises,\" Prof Gift says.",
      "He adds that though Musk's primary role will be \"slashing through the thicket of red tape that is the US federal government\", his position will also give him influence in the new administration.",
      "\"While his role in the Department of Government Efficiency will be a more informal one, there\u2019s no doubt that he\u2019s got Trump's ear - at least for the moment.\"",

      "The president-elect picked Florida Congressman Mike Waltz, a retired Army colonel, as his national security adviser \u2013 a key foreign policy post within the White House. Waltz has said the US is in a \u201ccold war\u201d with China and was one of the first members of Congress to call for a US boycott of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.",

      "While Trump has yet to officially name his choice for secretary of state, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 another China hawk \u2013 appears to be the leading contender for the top diplomatic job. In 2020, Rubio was sanctioned by the Chinese government after he pushed measures to punish the nation for its crackdown on pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong.",

The move would strengthen presidential power by undercutting the chamber\u2019s constitutional role to \u201cadvise and consent\u201d on political appointees.",

Senators who move to administration roles can quickly be replaced by appointment from the governor of their home state.

    "title": "From political outsider to Ghana's 'Mr Digital'",
    "published": "Tue, 19 Nov 2024 00:30:29 GMT",
    "summary": "Presidential candidate Mahamudu Bawumia hopes he can silence his critics once more to become Ghana's leader.",
    "story": [
      "Mahamudu Bawumia soared from being a political outsider to become Ghana's second-in-command - and in December he could make history as the country's first Muslim president.",
      "Bawumia, currently Ghana's vice-president, was chosen by the governing New Patriotic Party (NPP) as their candidate for the forthcoming general election.",
      "The 61-year-old Tottenham Hotspur supporter has quite the reputation.",
      "He is an intellectual educated at Oxford University, is never seen without his signature slim, rectangular glasses and has been dubbed \"Mr Digital\" thanks to his pledge to whip Ghana into a technological heavyweight.",
      "But because he is head of the government's economic management team, many Ghanaians associate Bawumia with the punishing cost of living crisis they're experiencing.",
      "Should Bawumia overcome the criticism and win the election, he will replace his current boss President Nana Akufo-Addo, who is approaching the end of his two-term limit.",
      "\"Mr Digital\" barrelled onto the political scene in 2008, sparking bemusement and scepticism.",
      "Bawumia was a 44-year-old who had never held public office, yet Akufo-Addo - then a mere presidential candidate - had chosen him as a running mate.",
      "Bawumia's father Alhaji had served in Ghana's earliest governments after the country gained independence from Britain in 1957, working closely with revered Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah.",
      "But the younger Bawumia had forged a career in economics and banking - serving as the deputy governor of Ghana's central bank.",
      "To many commentators and NPP insiders, it made no sense for Akufo-Addo to pick Bawumia over seasoned party members.",
      "Akufo-Addo ended up losing the election to John Atta Mills from the National Democratic Congress (NDC) by a tiny margin.",
      "Bawumia lost out on the VP job - but his charismatic campaign had silenced the naysayers.",
      "\"He fired [up] the NPP campaign. I think no-one else could have done a better job, to be honest, in terms of the support he gave to the NPP,\" Ghanaian political scientist Dr Clement Sefa-Nyarko told the BBC.",
      "Akufo-Addo and Bawumia gave the elections another go in 2012. Again, they lost.",
      "The NPP challenged the election results in the Supreme Court, choosing Bawumia as their star witness.",
      "During the proceedings, which were broadcast on national television, Bawumia came across as witty and unflustered by the relentless, days-long cross-examination.",
      "\u201cPeople were like, who is this guy? He's really the guy to root for,\" said Dr Sefa-Nyarko, who lectures on African leadership at King's College London.",
      "Akufo-Addo decided to keep Bawumia on his ticket and in 2016, on their third shot at power, the NPP won with 51.3% of the vote. Bawumia finally became vice-president.",
      "Bawumia's journey to the top began in 1963, when he was born into a large family in the northern city of Tamale.",
      "He was the 12th of his father's 18 children.",
      "After completing primary and secondary school in Ghana, Bawumia moved to the UK for undergraduate study and went on to gain a masters in economics from the prestigious Oxford University.",
      "To support himself during his studies, he took up jobs as a taxi driver and cleaner.",
      "He returned to Ghana in 2000 to work at the central bank, where he worked his way up to become deputy governor.",
      "Bawumia campaigned on this economic know-how during his attempts to become VP. Therefore, he faced heavy criticism when Ghana plummeted into its most severe economic crisis in years under his watch.",
      "Inflation hit a record 54% in December 2022 and the country was forced to take a $3bn (\u00a32.3bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund after government debt soared.",
      "In response to the criticism, Bawumia has said the economic management team he headed had no \"decision-making powers\" and that it merely provided advice to the government.",
      "But for many, this wasn't good enough.",
      "\"In terms of character, in terms of integrity, people started questioning themselves: 'What is this? How did it end up here? We thought you were the best guy, and look at where we've ended up',\" Franklin Cudjoe, a Ghanaian political commentator and head of the Imani Centre for Policy and Education, told the BBC.",
      "Along with his role as an economist, Bawumia has also built the reputation of being a digital visionary.",
      "Ghana's digital ecosystem has seen \"significant growth\" especially in areas such as mobile phone connectivity, Charles Abani, head of the United Nations team in Ghana, remarked last month.",
      "This \"remarkable digital transformation\" was \"spearheaded\" by Bawumia, news website African Business reported, while Ghanaian newspaper The Chronicle hailed Bawumia's \"expertise in global digital transformation\".",
      "Bawumia said he initiated a partnership between Ghana's government and US-based company Zipline, which led to the creation of the world's largest vaccine delivery network.",
      "He said he reached out to Zipline, which uses drones to fly health products to hard-to-reach clinics, after his father died from a loss of blood.",
      "Although this passion for technology is celebrated by some, others are more sceptical.",
      "Mr Cudjoe said Bawumia has been campaigning on digitalisation rather than confronting debates about the government's handling of the economy.",
      "\"Whether Bawumia was in power or not, digitalisation was bound to happen in this country because we had already started it anyway,\" Mr Cudjoe said.",
      "Dr Sefa-Nyarko said of Bawumia: \"What he has been very successful at is to push and also claim all credit for digitalisation outcomes of the current government.\"",
      "Bawumia's personal life has also been a strength in his presidential campaign. His wife of 20 years, Samira, is a former beauty queen who is widely admired for her chic outfits.",
      "The Second Lady is also vocal when it comes to party politics - and has embarked on campaign tours for the NPP.",
      "The couple have four children together. They are proud followers of Islam - a religion practised by roughly one in five Ghanaians.",
      "Most people in Ghana are Christians but there is not much evidence that coming from a religious minority will hinder Bawumia's election chances, Dr Sefa-Nyarko said.",
      "The NPP has given its \"full support\" to Bawumia's candidacy, \"his Muslim faith notwithstanding\", Dr Sefa-Nyarko added.",
      "\"This could translate into widespread support across the country as well.\"",
      "Bawumia's geographical identity might be of greater consequence than his religion. The vice-president hails from northern Ghana, which is one of the NDC's strongest political bases.",
      "By choosing Bawumia as its presidential candidate, the NPP will be hoping to make inroads in the north, while retaining support in its heartland in the south.",
      "Bawumia has been traversing north, south, east and west in what he calls the \"possibilities bus\", a blue and red campaign vehicle emblazoned with the slogan \"it is possible\".",
      "To some, he is the face of economic mismanagement, but the vice-president retains some of the optimism he held when he was a 44-year-old embarking on an eight-year battle for power.",
      "\"I have the courage to accept when things do not go as well as planned,\" he told voters in his manifesto.",
      "\"But I also have a mindset of possibilities, and faith in ourselves, that we can rise and achieve great things in our lifetime.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 00:30:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Having built a $20bn oil refinery, Aliko Dangote is now at the heart of a row in the murky industry.",
    "story": [
      "Petrol production at Nigerian business tycoon Aliko Dangote\u2019s $20bn (\u00a315.5bn) state-of-the-art oil refinery ought to be some of the best business news Nigeria has had in years.",
      "But many Nigerians will judge its success on two key questions - firstly: \"Will I get cheaper petrol?\"",
      "Sorry, but probably no - unless the international price of crude drops.",
      "And secondly: \"Will I still have to spend hours watching my hair turn grey in a hypertension-inducing fuel queue?\"",
      "Hopefully those days are gone but it might partly depend on the behaviour of what Mr Dangote calls \"the oil mafia\".",
      "For much of the time since oil was first discovered in Nigeria in 1956, the downstream sector, which includes the stage when crude is refined into petrol and other products, has been a cesspit of shady deals with successive governments heavily involved.",
      "It has always been impossible to follow the money, but you know there is something dreadfully wrong when the headline \"Nigeria\u2019s state-owned oil firm fails to pay $16bn in oil revenues\", pops up on your news feed, as it did in 2016.",
      "It is only in the last five years that the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) has been publishing accounts.",
      "The Africa head at the Eurasia Group think-tank, Amaka Anku, hails the Dangote refinery, in which the NNPC has a 7% stake, as \"a very significant moment\" for the West African state.",
      "\"What you had in the downstream sector was an inefficient, corrupt monopoly,\" she says.",
      "\"What the local refinery allows you to do is have a truly competitive downstream sector with multiple players who will be more efficient, profit making and they\u2019ll pay taxes.\"",
      "To put it bluntly, the population of this oil-rich nation has been conned on a colossal scale for many years.",
      "Oil revenue accounts for nearly 90% of Nigeria\u2019s export earnings but a relatively small number of business people and politicians have gorged themselves on the oil wealth.",
      "Aspects of the business model have been baffling, including that of Nigeria\u2019s four previously existing oil refineries.",
      "Built in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, they have fallen into disrepair.",
      "Last year Nigeria\u2019s parliament reported that over the previous decade the state had spent a staggering $25bn trying and failing to fix the moribund facilities.",
      "So Africa\u2019s largest oil producer has been exporting its crude which is then refined abroad, much to the delight of some well-connected traders.",
      "It would be like a bakery with a broken oven. But rather than fix it, the owner sends balls of dough to another firm that shoves them in a working oven and sells the loaves back to the baker.",
      "The NNPC swaps Nigeria\u2019s crude oil for the refined products, including petrol, which are shipped back home.",
      "Exactly how much money changes hands and who benefits from these \"oil swaps\" is just one of the unknowns in these deals.",
      "\"No-one has been able to nail down who exactly has benefited. It\u2019s almost like a beer parlour gossip about who is getting what,\" says Toyin Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "The NNPC began subsidising the price of petrol in the 1970s to cushion the blow when global prices soared. Every year it clawed this money back by depositing lower royalty payments - the money it received for every barrel pumped out of the ground - with the Nigerian treasury.",
      "In 2022 the subsidy cost the government $10bn, more than 40% of the total money it collected in taxes.",
      "On his second day in office Nigeria\u2019s Vice-President Kashim Shettima referred to \"the fuel subsidy scam\" being \"an albatross around the neck of the economy\".",
      "Nigerian oil expert Kelvin Emmanuel says in 2019 the country\u2019s official petrol consumption \"jumped by 284% to 70m litres per day without empirical evidence to justify such a sharp increase in demand\".",
      "Parliament has previously reported that - at least on paper - importers were being paid to bring in far more petrol than the country consumed. There was a lot of money to be made exporting some of the subsidised petrol to neighbouring countries where prices were far higher.",
      "The NNPC earned billions of dollars a year from the crude oil production. But for many years, under previous governments, some of its profits never reached the treasury as it was accused by state governors and federal lawmakers of including these inflated subsidy costs on its balance sheet.",
      "The NNPC did not respond to a request for an interview or a response to these allegations but in June denied it had ever \"inflated its subsidy claims with the federal government\".",
      "It may have been the main source of revenue for successive governments but for decades, until 2020, the board did not disclose its audited accounts. Its press release from March this year promised more transparency and accountability.",
      "After coming to power in May 2023, President Bola Tinubu said the subsidy was unsustainable and suddenly cut it - pump prices immediately tripled.",
      "He also stopped the policy of artificially propping up the value of the local currency, the naira, and let market forces determine its value.",
      "When he took over, the exchange rate was 460 naira to the US dollar. In November 2024 it was over 1,600.",
      "The triple shock of higher fuel prices, sporadic shortages of supply and a depreciating currency has been a tough body blow for people across the country, many of whom are forced to run generators to keep the lights on and phones charged.",
      "\"Beyond the financial burden, the uncertainty and stress of constantly dealing with fuel shortages have added a layer of anxiety to everyday tasks,\" is how one Lagos resident summed it up.",
      "\"I feel like I\u2019m always navigating through crisis mode. It\u2019s exhausting.\"",
      "As the naira plunged and pump prices increased several times, the government, aware of the potential danger of protests, continued to pipette some medicine to the masses.",
      "In a move which could be likened to swallowing half a paracetamol for acute appendicitis, the government made sure people were paying slightly less than the market rate for a litre of petrol.",
      "In other words, the NNPC was selling at a loss and the subsidy was still alive.",
      "But with two recent increases in October, Nigerians are now paying market prices for fuel for the first time in three decades. In the main city Lagos it went up from 858 naira ($0.52) to 1,025 naira per litre.",
      "One of the major factors in Nigeria\u2019s economic crisis has been a limited supply of foreign currency. The country does not export enough products and services to bring in the dollars.",
      "But lots of people, including fuel traders, have been chasing the same limited supply of foreign currency, which leads to the naira losing even more value.",
      "The good news is that Mr Dangote\u2019s facility is going to buy crude and sell refined fuels in Nigeria in the local currency, which will leave more dollars available for everyone else.",
      "The bad news for those hoping this will mean cheaper fuel is that the price Mr Dangote pays for a barrel of local crude will still be the naira equivalent of the international cost in dollars.",
      "So if the price of crude goes up on the world market, Nigerians will still be forced to fork out more naira. Refining locally will mean less freight costs but that\u2019s a relatively small saving.",
      "It is hoped that the arrival of Mr Dangote\u2019s oil refinery will help bring a measure of transparency to the sector.",
      "He knew he would be upsetting some of those who benefit from the murky status quo when the $20bn project began. But, he says, he underestimated the challenge.",
      "\"I knew there would be a fight. But I didn\u2019t know that the mafia in oil, they are stronger than the mafia in drugs,\" Mr Dangote told an investment conference in June.",
      "\"They don\u2019t want the trade to stop. It\u2019s a cartel. Dangote comes along and he\u2019s going to disrupt them entirely. Their business is at risk,\u201d says Mr Emmanuel, the oil expert.",
      "The fact that there have been some public disagreements with the regulator has only fuelled that suspicion.",
      "Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery near Lagos is thirsty, with a capacity of 650,000 barrels of crude a day.",
      "You would have thought being located in Nigeria would make supply easy but then up pops this headline: \"Nigeria\u2019s Dangote buys Brazilian crude\".",
      "It follows a row over supply and pricing. The regulatory authority has complained about Mr Dangote\u2019s negotiating tactics.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s crude oil is low in sulphur and, as one of the most prized in the world, fetches a higher price than many of its competitors.",
      "When discussions over price began, Farouk Ahmed, the chief executive of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), accused Mr Dangote of \"wanting a Lamborghini for the price of a Toyota\".",
      "Mr Dangote has complained of not being allocated as much crude as earlier agreed but even when the price issue is resolved, he will still need to import some crude.",
      "\u201cNNPC doesn\u2019t have enough crude for Dangote. Despite all this instruction to give ample supply of crude to the refinery, NNPC can\u2019t supply Dangote with more than 300,000 barrels per day,\" says Mr Akinosho of the Africa Oil+Gas Report.",
      "He says this is partly because the NNPC has pre-sold millions of barrels of oil for loans.",
      "In August 2023 it secured a $3bn loan from the Afreximbank financial institution. In return it is due to supply 164 million barrels of crude.",
      "In September the NNPC admitted it was significantly in debt. It was reported to be owing its suppliers around $6bn for fuel brought into the country.",
      "Nigeria\u2019s oil production has plummeted in recent years from around 2.1 million barrels per day in 2018 to around 1.3 million barrels per day in 2023.",
      "The NNPC has been stressing oil theft as the number one reason why production has dropped.",
      "It says in just one week - from 28 September to 4 October - there were 161 incidents of oil theft across the Niger Delta and 45 illegal refineries were \"discovered\".",
      "But Ms Anku believes that \"the theft problem is overrated by the NNPC and the oil sector\".",
      "\"It\u2019s a convenient excuse,\u201d she adds.",
      "She points to other contributing factors causing the drop in production, including international oil companies selling their on-shore oil fields - some of which may no longer be viable having pumped oil for 60 years.",
      "The 66-year-old Dangote, who is listed by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as the second wealthiest person in Africa, made his fortune in cement and sugar.",
      "He has always denied the suggestion that his empire benefitted from links to politicians in power who helped ensure he had a monopoly.",
      "Today there are those who are critical of Mr Dangote\u2019s tactics and amid tension with the regulatory authorities, the same accusation has resurfaced when it comes to the supply of fuel in Nigeria.",
      "\"Mr Dangote asked me to stop issuing licences for importation and that everyone should buy from him. To which I said 'No' because it\u2019s not good for the market. We have energy security interests,\" says Mr Ahmed of the regulatory authority.",
      "Mr Dangote has not commented on the accusation but has said it makes business sense for the traders to buy from his refinery rather than from outside.",
      "A feud between the regulator and Mr Dangote over supplies and pricing has rumbled on and morphed into another row with local fuel traders refusing to buy from the new refinery.",
      "The mud slinging has also included allegations that some traders have been buying up substandard fuel from Russia which is then blended with other products before being shipped into Nigeria.",
      "But not everyone is worried or surprised by the disagreements.",
      "Ms Anku points to lessons learnt from US businessmen back in the 19th Century.",
      "\"The JP Morgans and the Stanfords \u2013 they didn\u2019t have it easy either. That\u2019s why they had to go and get government support and subsidies to build their railways and so on.",
      "\"I see the drama as a very normal process as you\u2019re changing the structure of the economy. There are losers, they lash out. There\u2019s no chance they\u2019ll stop the refinery from working or selling its products to the Nigerian markets\u2026 in my view.\"",
      "The modern, local refinery has also led to a debate over the quality of fuel on the market. It is an important issue given the vast number of generators belching out fumes across Nigeria as a result of the woeful power supply.",
      "\"Every day I wake up to the smell of what I\u2019m sure [could] kill me. It\u2019s because of the quality of the diesel,\" says Mr Akinosho.",
      "He sees Mr Dangote\u2019s refinery as a real opportunity for higher quality petroleum products in Nigeria which would be better for both car engines and people\u2019s lungs.",
      "But right now, Nigerians being hit hard in the pocket may find it difficult to be optimistic.",
      "Arguments between officials at the Dangote refinery, the oil marketers and the regulators are batted back and forth in the media. All sides have been accused of hiding some facts and figures which leaves people guessing what is going on inside this still somewhat opaque industry.",
      "\"Everyone is a villain. There are no heroes here,\" concludes Mr Akinosho.",

    "summary": "Indians are being stripped of their life savings by savvy scammers putting them under \"digital arrest\".",
    "story": [
      "For a harrowing week in August, Ruchika Tandon, a 44-year-old neurologist at one of India\u2019s top hospitals, was ensnared in what felt like a high-stakes federal crime investigation.",
      "Yet, it was an elaborate scam - a web of deceit spun by scammers who manipulated her every move and drained her and her family\u2019s life savings.",
      "Under the pretence of \u201cdigital arrest\u201d- a term fabricated by her perpetrators - Dr Tandon was coerced to take leave from work, surrender her daily freedoms, and comply with nonstop surveillance and instructions from strangers on the phone, who convinced her she was at the centre of a grave investigation.",
      "The \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scam involves fraudsters impersonating law enforcement officials on video calls, threatening victims with arrest over fake charges, and pressuring them to transfer large sums of money.",
      "In Dr Tandon's case, they stripped her and her family of nearly 25m rupees ($300,000; \u00a3235,000) across bank accounts, mutual funds, pension funds, and life insurance  - years of savings lost in a manufactured nightmare.",
      "She is not alone. Indians lost over 1,200m rupees to \u201cdigital arrest\u201d hoaxes between January and April this year, according to official figures. These figures only scratch the surface, as many victims don\u2019t report such crimes. Stolen funds are often funnelled into overseas accounts or cryptocurrency wallets. More than 40% of the scams have been traced back to Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos, according to officials.",
      "Things are so bad that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about the scam in his monthly radio talk in October.",
      "\"Whenever you receive such a call, don\u2019t be scared. You should be aware that no investigative agency ever inquires like this through a phone call or a video call,\" he said.",
      "India faces a range of cyber crimes, from fake investment and trading to dating scams. But the \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scam stands out as especially elaborate and sinister - meticulously planned, relentless, and invasive to every part of a victim's life.",
      "Sometimes scammers reveal themselves during video calls, while other times they remain hidden, relying solely on audio. The plot could be straight out of an outlandish Bollywood thriller - except it is carefully choreographed.",
      "On that fateful first day, scammers posing as officials from India\u2019s telecom regulator called Lucknow-based Dr Tandon, claiming her number would be disconnected due to \u201c22 complaints\u201d of harassing messages sent from it.",
      "Moments later, a man claiming to be a senior police officer took over. He accused her of using a joint bank account with her mother to launder money for women and child trafficking.",
      "In the background, a jarring chorus of voices echoed, \u201cArrest her, arrest her!\u201d",
      "\u201cThe police will be coming in five minutes to arrest you. All police stations have been alerted,\u201d the man warned.",
      "\u201cI was angry and frustrated. I kept saying this can\u2019t be true,\u201d Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "The officer seemed to soften, but with a catch. He said India\u2019s federal detective agency, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), would take over as it was a \u201cmatter of national secrecy\".",
      "\u201cI will try to talk and persuade them not to put you in physical custody. But you have to be in digital custody,\u201d he insisted.",
      "Dr Tandon used a feature phone that lacked video calling, making it impossible for the scammers to proceed. So they forced her to drive to a store and buy a smartphone.",
      "Over the next six days, three men and a woman, posing as police officers and a judge, kept her under constant surveillance on Skype, with her phone camera running nonstop.",
      "They made her wake up her students at night to buy extra data packs to keep the scam going. She was required to place the phone throughout the house - while cooking, sleeping, and even outside the bathroom - tracking her every move.",
      "She was also forced to lie to her hospital and relatives, claiming she was too ill to work or meet anyone. When an uncle visited, they ordered her to hide under a bed, with the phone camera running.",
      "For a full week, Dr Tandon endured more 700 questions on her life and work, a staged trial, falsified court documents, and promises of a digital \u201cbail\u201d in exchange for her life savings. In the fake court she was ordered to dress in white to \u201cshow respect to the judge\". The callers had switched off their video, leaving only their fake names and authentic-looking badges displayed on blank screens.",
      "At one point, during the ordeal, the scammers even talked to Dr Tandon\u2019s 70-year-old mother, urging her to stay silent \"for her daughter\u2019s sake\".",
      "When the doctor repeatedly broke down on camera, the scammers told her: \u201cTake a deep breath and relax. You have not committed a murder. You have just laundered money.\"",
      "In a desperate bid for freedom, she transferred her entire savings from half-a-dozen different bank accounts to accounts controlled by the scammers, believing she would be refunded after \u201cgovernment verification\". Instead, she lost everything. The callers disconnected the line after transfer was completed.",
      "Back at work after a week, exhaustion drove Dr Tandon to search terms like \u201cdigital custody\u201d and \u201cnew CBI investigation methods\u201d on the internet.",
      "This led to newspaper stories detailing similar \u201cdigital arrest\u201d scams across the country. She still had refused to accept she was a victim of an elaborate hoax, and had rushed to the police station, hoping that \u201cthe police station and officers were real\u201d.",
      "Dr Tandon says she approached the police station, anxious.",
      "\"I've been receiving strange calls for days,\" she started, trying to explain.",
      "Before she could say more, a woman officer interrupted sharply, \"Have you transferred any money?\"",
      "At another police station, \"the moment they heard my case, they began laughing\", Dr Tandon recalls.",
      "\"This is very common now,\u201d a policeman said.",
      "Over 500km (310 miles) away in Delhi, author and journalist Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay narrowly escaped the scam in July.",
      "He endured 28 hours under \"digital arrest,\" as scammers claimed that his defunct bank account had been used to launder money. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s suspicions aroused when a caller asked him why he hadn't redeemed his mutual funds - not a question a police officer would usually ask on the phone.",
      "Mr Mukhopadhyay slipped from his study, where scammers were surveilling him on his desktop, and confided briefly with his wife. Friends, alerted by his message, quickly asked her to disconnect his modem, freeing him from their grip.",
      "\"I became a digital slave until my friends exposed the scam,\" says Mr Mukhopadhyay. \"I had moved my funds into my account, ready to transfer it all to them. I felt like a fool when it was over.\u201d",
      "Progress on catching these scammers remains unclear, with many victims frustrated by slow moving complaint processes.",
      "Dr Tandon, however, has seen some success: police have arrested 18 suspects, including a woman, from across India. About a third of the stolen money has been recovered in cash and seized in different bank accounts.  She has received only 1.2m of the 25m rupees of her looted money so far \u2013 that was the cash recovered.",
      "Investigating officer Deepak Kumar Singh says the scammers were running an elaborate operation.",
      "\"The scammers are educated men and women - fluent in English and various Indian languages - including engineering graduates, cyber security experts, and banking professionals. Most operate through Telegram channels,\" Mr Singh, a senior police official, told the BBC.",
      "The scammers were clever, using targeted information from their victims' social media, investigators believe.",
      "\"They track you, gather personal information, and identify your weaknesses,\" says Mr Singh. \"Then they strike quickly, using a hit-and-run approach with potential victims.\"",
      "The scammers knew Mr Mukhopadhyay was a journalist and writer - author of a biography on Prime Minister Modi. They knew Dr Tandon was a doctor and had attended a conference in Goa. They had their biometric national identity numbers. Mr Mukhopadhyay wonders if they were aware he was among the journalists whose house was raided by Delhi police in October 2023 as part of an investigation into the funding of NewsClick (Critics had deplored the move as an attack on press freedom, a charge the government denied.)",
      "They also made errors. Mr Mukhopadhyay\u2019s caller was unaware of how long it typically took to redeem funds, which raised his suspicions. Dr Tandon\u2019s fake judge, called himself Judge Dhananjay and displayed a fake insignia with a picture of the recently retired Chief Justice Dhananjay Chandrachud. Yet, overwhelmed by the moment, she missed the clue.",
      "Dr Tandon says she still lives in a haze, struggling to separate reality from the nightmare that overtook her life. Even when she filed the police complaint, she wondered, \u201cWas the police station also fake?\u201d",
      "Every phone call stirs fresh anxiety.",

      "For generations, her family had lived among the orchards and green lands in the heart of the Hunza valley in the Karakorum mountains of Pakistan-administered Gilgit-Baltistan region.",
      "\u201cIn the morning everything was normal, I went to school,\u201d Komal says, \u201cbut then my teacher told me that Hassanabad bridge had collapsed.\u201d",
      "Upstream, a glacial lake had formed, then suddenly burst - sending water, boulders and debris cascading down the valley and gathering speed. The ground trembled so violently some people thought there was an earthquake.",
      "When the torrent hit the cement bridge that connected the two parts of the village, it turned it to rubble.",
      "\u201cBy the time I came home, people were taking what they could out of their home,\u201d Komal says. She grabbed books, laundry, anything she could carry, but remembers thinking that with their house so far above the water there was no way it could be affected.",
      "That was until they received a phone call from the other side of the valley; their neighbours could see that the water was stripping away the hillside their home stood on.",
      "Then the homes began to collapse.",
      "\u201cI remember my aunt and uncle were still inside their home when the flood came and washed out the whole kitchen,\u201d she says. The family made it to safe ground, but their homes disappeared over the edge.",
      "Today, walking through the grey rubble and dust, there are still coat hooks on the wall, a few tiles in the bathroom, a window with the glass long gone. It\u2019s been two years, but nothing has grown on the crumbling cliff that used to be Komal's garden in Hassanabad.",
      "\u201cThis used to be all a green place,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I visit this place I remember my childhood memories, the time I spent here. But the barren places, they hurt me, they make me feel sad.\u201d",

So I think this is the right time, although we are still late, but even now this is the time to think about it.\u201d",

      "There are other mitigation measures across the region; stone and wire barriers to try to slow floodwater, systems to monitor glacier melt, rainfall and water levels, speakers installed in villages to warn the community if danger looks likely. But many who work here say they need more resources.",
      "\u201cWe have installed early warning systems in some valleys,\u201d says Mr Ahmed. \u201cThese were identified by the Pakistan Meteorological Department and they gave us a list of around 100 valleys. But because of limited resources, we are only able to intervene in 16.\u201d",

      "This month he set up a \"fun challenge\" - called the 'world's longest footpath run' - which invited people to walk or jog on an 11km (8 miles) stretch of footpath and make a note of all the obstacles they encountered, like hawkers, garbage or broken slabs of concrete. Next, they were asked to rate the footpath on a scale of one to five.",
      "\"When you have specifics, it gets easier to ask the authorities to take action. Instead of telling your local politician \"the footpaths are bad\", you can ask him or her \"to fix specific spots on a street,\" Mr Pai says.",
      "Mr Pai, who is the founder of Bangalore Walks, a non-profit that promotes walking, is among several citizen activists who are pushing to make the country's roads more pedestrian-friendly.",
      "In India's capital, a tour company called Delhi by Cycle has been advocating for making the city more cycle-friendly and walkable. These walking-enthusiasts are holding awareness walks, building walking apps and lobbying with politicians to make a change.",
      "Even in India's biggest cities, proper footpaths are few and far between and they are often overrun by hawkers and shops, parked vehicles and even cattle. In some places, they double up as homes for the poor.",
      "Even footpaths that exist are often not built to standard or properly maintained. Navigating roads on foot through crowds and traffic can be a nightmare.",
      "Last month, Walking Project, a citizen's group in India's financial capital, Mumbai, released a 'pedestrian manifesto' ahead of Maharashtra state elections to highlight the poor condition of the city's roads and encourage local politicians to take action.",
      "The manifesto included demands for better parking, designated hawking zones, pedestrian-friendly corridors on arterial roads and to make footpaths more accessible to those with mobility challenges.",
      "\"Government statistics show that almost 50% of the city's population relies on walking, which is far greater than the 11% that uses private transport and the combined 15% that uses tuk-tuks and buses,\" says Vendant Mhatre, convener of Walking Project.",
      "\"And yet, pedestrians are the most ignored group of users when it comes to framing policies around transport or road safety,\" he adds.",
      "According to the latest government estimates on road accidents, pedestrian fatalities were the second-highest after those of two-wheeler riders. In 2022, over 10,000 pedestrians lost their lives on national highways across the country, with around 21,000 more sustaining injuries in accidents.",
      "\"Authorities often resort to band-aid solutions like adding speed bumps or a signal to curb road accidents. But what is really needed is inter-connected footpaths that can accommodate high footfall,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Studies have found that addressing the problems of this forgotten group of road users can reap benefits for multiple stakeholders.",
      "In 2019, researchers in the southern city of Chennai studied the impact the construction of new footpaths on 100km (62 miles) of the city's streets had on the environment, economy and the health and safety of citizens.",
      "They found that the new footpaths encouraged 9% to 27% of the surveyed respondents to walk instead of using motorized transport, which led to a reduction in greenhouse gases and particulate matter. They also learned that the footpaths provided new opportunities for women and lower-income groups, helping them save money as well.",
      "The survey highlighted how people with disabilities and women might have nuanced requirements from footpaths and that tailoring improvements to meet their needs could enhance accessibility and equity.",
      "\"Very often, people don't have a benchmark for footpath quality, especially if they haven't travelled abroad or been exposed to places that have good facilities for pedestrians,\" Mr Mhatre says. He reasons that that's why there isn't enough outrage about the quality or absence of footpaths in the country.",
      "He also points out that most people see walking as an activity performed for leisure or exercise. And so, the infrastructure they associate with walking stops at gardens or walking tracks. In reality, however, people walk to various destinations daily, so the scope of walking infrastructure is far broader.",
      "\"Walking is the most economical and environment-friendly way to navigate one's city and it's high time our leaders paid as much attention to walking infrastructure as they do to public transport,\" Mr Mhatre says.",
      "Geetam Tiwari, a professor of civil engineering, says that the main problem is that too much focus is given to solving the problem of car congestion on roads.",
      "\"To improve the flow of traffic, authorities often narrow down footpaths or eliminate them entirely,\" she says. Ms Tiwari says that this approach is problematic because doing so makes it difficult for pedestrians to access public transport systems, like buses and metros, which can take the pressure off the roads.",
      "\"It might seem counter-intuitive, but allowing the congestion to persist and focussing on improving infrastructure for pedestrians will help solve the traffic problem in the long run,\" she says.",
      "Ms Tiwari also says that the federal government should make it mandatory for states to implement the guidelines issued by the Indian Road Congress -  a national organisation that lays down designing standards for roads and highways.",
      "She says that cities can also implement their own Non-Motorised Transport Policy (NMTP) to create better infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians.",
      "\"At the moment, only a handful of cities in India have experimented with a NMTP but its time more cities step up to the plate,\" she adds.",

    "story": [
      "Described as a virtual singer powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Mya Blue says: \"I am not the enemy, I am just a music lover exploring the different sounds of the world.\"",
      "Her Instagram account, where she makes this statement, has the tag line: \"I may not be human but I sing from my soul\" - and is the creation of Nigerian musician and producer Eclipse Nkasi.",
      "She features in his recently released remix of Joromi, a classic tune by the late Nigerian highlife artist Sir Victor Uwaifo.",
      "She and her creator want to calm the fears that many musicians the world over have about the impact of AI on the music industry.",
      "Earlier this year, for example, high-profile artists such as Billie Eilish and Nicki Minaj called for a halt to the \"predatory\" use of AI tools which they say steal artists' voices.",
      "And given a lack of understanding about AI throughout Africa, and the fact that AI tends to rely on data sources collated in the West, there are concerns about how African music and cultural heritage will be affected.",
      "But there are many African artists and industry professionals who are excited about the possibilities this emerging technology offers.",
      "Indeed Nkasi says the fact that AI is in its infancy in Africa may be a boon for the continent.",
      "\"There is a huge threat, but just saying: 'Let\u2019s abolish AI' is not going to work - there are too many countries and people invested,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"The best thing we can do is figure out better ways to use it.\"",
      "The 33-year-old is determined to be that pioneer and last year also produced the continent\u2019s first AI-powered music album Infinite Echoes.",
      "Nkasi says he has intentionally taken a manual and creative approach to using AI in his music, primarily using it to generate samples.",
      "\"My biggest drive with AI is its application, finding healthy ways to apply it. With each project it was important to find something that it did that moved the needle forward,\" he says.",
      "But while Nkasi is happy to experiment with the new technology, some see it as a threat to African culture.",
      "For Kenyan musician and producer Tabu Osusa, it heralds the risk of cultural appropriation - with AI passing off African sounds without acknowledging their source.",
      "This is because AI is able to quickly create new compositions by learning from existing music.",
      "\"My problem with AI is the ownership. Once you have taken some music from Ghana or Nigeria, who owns that music? How would you find out where the original creators are and ensure they are credited? It\u2019s theft for me through the backroom,\" Osusa told the BBC.",
      "\"Due to unregulated sampling methods by musicians, AI will enable recording company moguls in the West to make colossal sums of money while leaving some creatives in African villages to languish in abject poverty.\"",
      "This fear is reflected in a report released last year by Creatives Garage, a Kenya-based arts platform which worked in collaboration with the Mozilla Foundation to study the impact of AI on the East African nation\u2019s creative communities.",
      "It revealed that most Kenyan musicians were anxious that AI could lead to others benefitting from their creativity, says Bukonola Ngobi, research consultant at Creatives Garage.",
      "The study also warned that AI\u2019s power to store data might sound the death knell for the culture around traditional music.",
      "One musician even questioned whether recording and storing traditional sounds for AI to replicate might be a disincentive for local artists to continue to learn traditional instruments, Ngobi says.",
      "Osusa goes even further: \"In Africa we mostly don\u2019t study music, we are born with it. We live it. It\u2019s very spiritual. Music in Africa is always alive. It\u2019s so dynamic. That shouldn\u2019t be taken away from us.\"",
      "Yet the report did show that for those with access to tech devices, AI not only provided creative music development but also the chance to develop cheaper marketing and design services.",
      "Although this would be no help for emerging artists from Africa\u2019s poorer communities - and might raise the barrier to pursuing a music career, warned Ngobi.",
      "\"If you don\u2019t have a laptop to start off with or you\u2019re a musician in an environment where there is no internet connectivity then how will you participate?\" she told the BBC.",
      "For those wanting to innovate, one of the problems Africa faces is the lack of data from the continent to dictate algorithms. Searches are often shaped by Western biases which decrease the accuracy and quality of work produced by AI for African musicians.",
      "For example, when Nkasi created Mya Blue using AI, he faced issues with her imagery - the artist presents as a Gen Z American girl with blue hair.",
      "\"AI is very limited in how it understands and perceives my space,\" he says.",
      "But the Nigerian musician views this as an opportunity for human contribution: \"The limits we Africans experience with AI can be a good thing.",
      "\"One can argue that right now, while AI can\u2019t give the very detailed African sound, there\u2019s still room for the guy who can play it. So I\u2019m not sure what we\u2019re really fighting for when we consider that a problem.\"",
      "Fellow Nigerian Emmanuel Ogala, the boss of AI-powered company Josplay, definitely sees the opportunities for Africa.",
      "His company uses AI models to collate detailed metadata and intelligence to create archives of the continent\u2019s diverse music heritage.",
      "\"African music is really complex and it\u2019s one of the most understudied types of music,\" he told the BBC.",
      "This was reflected at the MTV Video Music Awards in September, when South African musician Tyla won the award for the Best Afrobeats song for her hit Water.",
      "During her acceptance speech she hit out against the tendency of Western award bodies to group all African artists under the umbrella of \"Afrobeats\" - a genre of music more associated with Nigeria and West Africa.",
      "\"African music is so diverse,\" she said. \"It\u2019s more than just Afrobeats. I come from South Africa. I represent amapiano. I represent my culture.\"",
      "Ogala feels AI would address such homogenisation and benefit African musicians by revealing to the world more of the continent\u2019s cultural diversity.",
      "\"A lot of the academics we speak to have knowledge that is very specific about a very small area of African music. You have to build for an African audience taking note of how fragmented our listening culture is. You just cannot humanly do that,\" he says.",
      "As AI continues to develop, there is consensus among African music artists, producers and researchers that there needs to be better financing.",
      "\"We need investment in the data infrastructure for the opportunities it presents to really be leveraged by people,\" says Ngobi.",
      "Ogala agrees and says that raising funds to develop his digital archive AI tool is difficult.",
      "\"We, the founders, have been funding the project out of our pockets because of our belief in the industry. If we put in place the fundamental building blocks, the industry will be a lot more viable than it is now.\"",
      "Added to this are the uncertainties around copyright legislation written for a pre-AI era which will need to be renegotiated. Copyright is already a huge issue for African artists whose music is often pirated, sold and played on the continent without them earning anything.",
      "These challenges aside, there is a growing realisation that unless the African music industry embraces the new technology, it is in danger of losing control of its talent and heritage.",
      "And Nkasi\u2019s Mya Blue certainly has big ambitions.",
      "During a Q&A on her Instagram, replying to a question about whether she could win a Grammy, she said: \"Who knows. As an AI [artist], I don\u2019t dream of trophies, but of resonating with hearts through music. But wouldn\u2019t it be fun to see a virtual artist on that stage?\"",

    "story": [
      "As the world waits to see how the return of Donald Trump will reshape relations between Washington and Beijing, China has just taken decisive action to entrench its position in Latin America.",
      "Trump won the US presidential election on a platform that promised tariffs as high as 60% on Chinese-made goods. Further south, though, a new China-backed megaport has the potential to create whole new trade routes that will bypass North America entirely.",
      "President Xi Jinping himself attended the inauguration of the Chancay port on the Peruvian coast this week, an indication of just how seriously China takes the development.",
      "Xi was in Peru for the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation Forum (Apec). But all eyes were on Chancay and what it says about China's growing assertiveness in a region that the US has traditionally seen as its sphere of influence.",
      "As seasoned observers see it, Washington is now paying the price for years of indifference towards its neighbours and their needs.",
      "\"The US has been absent from Latin America for so long, and China has moved in so rapidly, that things have really reconfigured in the past decade,\" says Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",
      "\"You have got the backyard of America engaging directly with China,\" she tells the BBC. \"That's going to be problematic.\"",
      "Even before it opened, the $3.5bn (\u00a32.75bn) project, masterminded by China's state-owned Cosco Shipping, had already turned a once-sleepy Peruvian fishing town into a logistical powerhouse set to transform the country's economy.",
      "China's official Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily, called it \"a vindication of China-Peru win-win co-operation\".",
      "Peru's President Dina Boluarte was similarly enthusiastic, describing the megaport as a \"nerve centre\" that would provide \"a point of connection to access the gigantic Asian market\".",
      "But the implications go far beyond the fortunes of one small Andean nation. Once Chancay is fully up and running, goods from Chile, Ecuador, Colombia and even Brazil are expected to pass through it on their way to Shanghai and other Asian ports.",
      "China already has considerable appetite for the region's exports, including Brazilian soybeans and Chilean copper. Now this new port will be able to handle larger ships, as well as cutting shipping times from 35 to 23 days.",
      "However, the new port will favour imports as well as exports. As signs grow that an influx of cheap Chinese goods bought online may be undermining domestic industry, Chile and Brazil have scrapped tax exemptions for individual customers on low-value foreign purchases.",
      "As nervous US military hawks have pointed out, if Chancay can accommodate ultra-large container vessels, it can also handle Chinese warships.",
      "The most strident warnings have come from Gen Laura Richardson, who has just retired as chief of US Southern Command, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.",
      "She has accused China of \"playing the \u2018long game\u2019 with its development of dual-use sites and facilities throughout the region\", adding that those sites could serve as \"points of future multi-domain access for the [People's Liberation Army] and strategic naval chokepoints\".",
      "Even if that prospect never materialises, there is a strong perception that the US is losing ground in Latin America as China forges ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).",
      "Outgoing US President Joe Biden was among the leaders at the Apec summit, on his first and last visit to South America during his four-year term. Media commentators remarked that he cut a diminished figure next to China's Xi.",
      "Prof \u00c1lvaro M\u00e9ndez, director of the Global South Unit at the London School of Economics, points out that while the US was taking Latin America for granted, Xi was visiting the region regularly and cultivating good relations.",
      "\"The bar has been set so low by the US that China only has to be a little bit better to get through the door,\" he says.",
      "Of course, Latin America is not the only part of the world targeted by the BRI. Since 2023, China's unprecedented infrastructure splurge has pumped money into nearly 150 countries worldwide.",
      "The results have not always been beneficial, with many projects left unfinished, while many developing countries that signed up for Beijing's largesse have found themselves burdened with debt as a result.",
      "Even so, left-wing and right-wing governments alike have cast aside their initial suspicions of China, because \"their interests are aligned\" with those of Beijing, says the Peterson Institute's Ms de Bolle: \"They have lowered their guard out of sheer necessity.\"",
      "Ms de Bolle says the US is right to feel threatened by this turn of events, since Beijing has now established \"a very strong foothold\" in the region at a time when president-elect Trump wants to \"rein in\" China.",
      "\"I think we will finally start to see the US putting pressure on Latin America because of China,\" she says, adding that most countries want to stay on the right side of both big powers.",
      "\"The region doesn't have to choose unless it's put in a position where they are forced to, and that would be very dumb.\"",
      "Looking ahead, South American countries such as Peru, Chile and Colombia would be vulnerable to pressure because of the bilateral free trade agreements they have with the US, which Trump could seek to renegotiate or even tear up.",
      "They will be watching keenly to see what happens to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is up for review in July 2026, but will be subject to negotiations during 2025.",
      "Whatever happens, Prof M\u00e9ndez of the LSE feels that the region needs more co-operation.",
      "\"It shouldn't be that all roads lead to Beijing or to Washington. Latin America has to find a more strategic way, it needs a coherent regional strategy,\" he says, pointing to the difficulty of getting 33 countries to agree a joint approach.",
      "Eric Farnsworth, vice-president at the Washington-based Council of the Americas, feels that there is still much goodwill towards the US in Latin America, but the region's \"massive needs\" are not being met by its northern neighbour.",
      "\"The US needs to up its game in the region, because people would choose it if there was a meaningful alternative to China,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Unlike many others, he sees some rays of hope from the incoming Trump administration, especially with the appointment of Marco Rubio as secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio has a real sense of a need to engage economically with the Western Hemisphere in a way that we just haven't done for a number of years,\" he says.",
      "But for successive US leaders, Latin America has been seen primarily in terms of illegal migration and illegal drugs. And with Trump fixated on plans to deport record numbers of immigrants, there is little indication that the US will change tack any time soon.",

      "The two regions together are home to 44% of the world\u2019s under-five population but account for about 70% of stunted children globally - a key indicator of malnutrition.",
      "But, while both have made significant strides in recent years, India\u2019s rate stands at 35.7%, with the average across Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s 49 countries at 33.6%.",
      "A child is considered stunted when they fall short of the expected height for their age - a clear sign of critical nutritional gaps.",
      "However, the study by Ashwini Deshpande (Ashoka University) and Rajesh Ramachandran (Monash University, Malaysia) found that focusing only on the height gap - or why Indian children are shorter than children in Sub-Saharan Africa - overlooks an important factor: the crucial role of social identity, especially caste, in child malnutrition in India.",
      "The first 1,000 days of a child's life, often called the \"golden period\", are pivotal: by age two, 80% of the brain develops, laying the foundation for lifelong potential. In these early years, access to healthcare, good nutrition, early learning, and a safe environment profoundly shapes a child's future.",
      "India and Sub-Saharan Africa, both with rapidly growing middle classes, young populations and significant workforce potential, share longstanding comparisons. In 2021, the World Bank reported, \u201cSub-Saharan Africa and South Asia [including India] account for over 85% of the global poor,\u201d underscoring similar challenges in poverty and development.",
      "Using official data, the authors looked at the most recent estimates of the stunting gaps between India and a sample of 19 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.",
      "Official data shows that more than 35% of India\u2019s 137 million children under five are stunted, with over a third also underweight. Globally, 22% of children under five are stunted.",
      "Then they examined six broad socially disadvantaged groups in India. Among them are adivasis (tribespeople living in remote areas) and Dalits (formerly known as untouchables), who alone comprise more than a third of the under-five population.",
      "The economists found that children from higher-ranked, non-stigmatised caste groups in India stood at 27% - markedly lower than the Sub-Saharan African rate.",
      "They also found that children from higher-ranking caste groups in India are some 20% less likely to experience stunting compared with those from marginalised groups, who occupy the lowest tiers of the caste hierarchy.",
      "This conclusion remains significant even after accounting for factors like birth order, sanitation practices, maternal height, sibling count, education, anaemia and household socio-economic status.",
      "This difference is despite seven decades of affirmative action, India's caste system - a four-fold hierarchy of the Hindu religion - remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\u201cThis should not be surprising given that children from better-off groups in India have access to more calories and face a better disease environment,\u201d the authors say.",
      "The reasons behind high stunting rates among Indian children have sparked a complex debate over the years.",
      "Some economists have argued that the differences are genetic - that Indian children are genetically disposed to lower heights.",
      "Others believe that improved nutrition over generations has historically closed height gaps thought to be genetic.",
      "Some studies have found that girls fare worse than boys and others just the opposite, using different global standards.",
      "To be sure, stunting has decreased across social groups - a separate 2022 study found that improvements in health and nutrition interventions, household living conditions and maternal factors led to reduction in stunting in four Indian states. (More than half of India's under-five children were stunted, according to a federal family health survey of 1992-93).",
      "Children from marginalised groups like adivasis are likely to be more malnourished.",
      "In Africa, the rate of stunting has also fallen since 2010, although the absolute number increased.",
      "But what is clear is that children from poor families, with less-educated mothers, or from marginalised groups, are especially vulnerable to stunting in India.",
      "\u201cThe debate on the height gap between Indian and Sub-Saharan African children has resulted in overlooking the role of social identity, especially caste status,\u201d the authors say.",
      "\u201cThis is a crucial dimension to understanding the burden of child nutrition in India.\u201d",
      "The analysis uses data from demographic and health surveys. For India, it includes the latest data from 2019-21, and for Sub-Saharan Africa, it includes data from 19 countries with surveys from 2015 onwards. The dataset covers anthropometric - measurements related to the physical dimensions and composition of the human body- outcomes for 195,024 children under five in India and 202,557 children under five in Sub-Saharan Africa."

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:01:23 GMT",
    "summary": "Makers of a new generation of European electric aircraft are struggling to raise money.",
    "story": [
      "One of the innovations at this year's Paris Olympics was supposed to be an electric flying taxi service.",
      "Germany's Volocopter promised its electric-powered, two-seater aircraft, the VoloCity, would be ferrying passengers around the city.",
      "It never happened. Instead the company ran demonstration flights.",
      "While missing that deadline was embarrassing, behind the scenes a more serious issue was playing out - Volocopter was urgently trying to raise fresh investment to keep the firm going.",
      "Talks to borrow \u20ac100m (\u00a383m; $106m) from the government failed in April.",
      "Now hopes are pinned on China's Geely, which is in talks to take an 85% stake in Volocopter in return for $95m of funding, according to a Bloomberg report. The deal could mean that any future manufacturing would be moved to China.",
      "Volocopter is one of dozens of companies around the world developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (EVTOL) aircraft.",
      "Their machines promise the flexibility of a helicopter, but without the cost, noise and emissions.",
      "However, faced with the massive cost of getting such novel aircraft approved by regulators and then building up manufacturing capabilities, some investors are bailing out.",
      "One of the most high-profile casualties is Lilium.",
      "The German company had developed a radical take on the EVTOL theme.",
      "Lilium's aircraft uses 30 electric jets that can be tilted in unison to swing between vertical lift and forward flight.",
      "The concept proved attractive, with the company claiming to have orders and memoranda of understanding for 780 jets from around the world.",
      "It was able to demonstrate the technology using a remote controlled scale model. Construction had begun on the first full-sized jets, and testing had been due to begin in early 2025.",
      "As recently as the Farnborough Airshow in July, Lilium\u2019s COO Sebastian Borel was sounding confident.",
      "\u201cWe are definitely burning through cash,\" he told the BBC. \u201cBut this is a good sign, because it means we are producing the aircraft. We\u2019re going to have three aircraft in production by the end of the year, and we have also raised \u20ac1.5bn\u201d.",
      "But then the money ran out.",
      "Lilium had been attempting to arrange a loan worth \u20ac100m from the German development bank, KfW. However, that required guarantees from national and state governments, which never materialised.",
      "In early November, the company put its main operating businesses into insolvency proceedings, and its shares were removed from the Nasdaq stock exchange.",
      "For the moment, work on the new aircraft is continuing, as the company works with restructuring experts to sell the business or bring in new investment. However, getting the new e-jet into production is looking more challenging than ever.",
      "The high-profile British player in the eVTOL market is Vertical Aerospace. The Bristol-based company was founded in 2016 by businessman Stephen Fitzpatrick, who also set up OVO Energy.",
      "Its striking VX4 design uses eight large propellers mounted on slim, aircraft style wings to generate lift. Mr Fitzpatrick has made ambitious claims about the aircraft, suggesting it would be \u201c100 times\u201d safer and quieter than a helicopter, for 20% of the cost.",
      "The company has made progress. After completing a programme of remote-controlled testing, it began carrying out piloted tests earlier this year. Initially, these were carried out with the aircraft tethered to the ground. In early November, it carried out its first untethered take-off and landing.",
      "But there have also been serious setbacks. In August last year, a remotely-piloted prototype was badly damaged when it crashed during testing at Cotswold Airport, after a propeller blade fell off.",
      "In May one of its key partners, the engineering giant Rolls Royce pulled out of a deal to supply electric motors for the aircraft.",
      "Ambitions remain sky high. Vertical Aerospace says it will deliver 150 aircraft to its customers by the end of the decade. By then, it also expects to be capable of producing 200 units a year, and to be breaking even in cash terms.",
      "Yet financial strains have been intensifying. Mr Fitzpatrick invested an extra $25m into the company in March. But a further $25m, due in August if alternative investment could not be found, has not been paid. As of September, Vertical had $57.4m on hand \u2013 but it expects to burn through nearly double that over the coming year.",
      "Hopes for the future appear to be pinned on doing a deal with the American financier Jason Mudrick, who is already a major creditor through his firm Mudrick Capital Management.",
      "He has offered to invest $75m into the business \u2013 and has warned the board of Vertical that rejecting his plan would inevitably lead to insolvency proceedings. But the move has been resisted by Mr Fitzpatrick, who would lose control of the company he founded.",
      "Sources close to the talks insist an agreement is now very close. The company believes if a deal can be done, it will unlock further fundraising opportunities.",
      "Amid the turbulence, one European project is quietly on track, says Bjorn Fehrm who has a background in aeronautical engineering and piloted combat jets for the Swedish Air Force. He now works for aerospace consultancy Leeham.",
      "He says that the EVTOL project underway at Airbus is likely to survive.",
      "Called the CityAirbus NextGen, the four-seater aircraft has eight propellers and a range of 80km.",
      "\"This is a technology project for their engineers, and they've got the money, and they've got the know how,\" says Mr Fehrm.",
      "Elsewhere in the world, other well funded start-ups stand a good change of getting their aircraft into production. That would include Joby and Archer in the US.",
      "Once the aircraft are being produced, the next challenge will be to see if there's a profitable market for them.",
      "The first routes are likely to be between airports and city centres. But will they make money?",
      "\"The biggest problem area when it comes to the cost of operation is the pilot and the batteries. You need to change the batteries a couple of times per year,\" points out Mr Fehrm.",
      "Given all the uncertainty and expense, you might wonder why investors put money into new electric aircraft in the first place.",
      "\"No one wanted to miss out on the next Tesla,\" laughs Mr Fehrm.",

    "story": [
      "Forty years after they began the task \u2013 and nearly four hundred years after receiving their first commission \u2013 sages in Paris have finally produced a new edition of the definitive French dictionary.",
      "The full ninth edition of the Dictionnaire de l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise was formally presented to President Macron this afternoon in the plush surroundings of the 17th century Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations on the left bank of the Seine.",
      "This is where the 40 wise men and women of the French Academy \u2013 so-called immortels (immortals) chosen for their contributions to French language and literature \u2013 have met since the body was first created by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635.",
      "Their task at the start was to \u201cgive certain rules to our language, to render it pure and eloquent\u201d \u2013 to which end they set about writing their first dictionary.",
      "However, the job has proved so slow \u2013 the first book was not produced until 1694 and today it takes more than a year to get through a single letter of the alphabet \u2013 that the relevance of the enterprise is increasingly in question.",
      "\u201cThe effort is praiseworthy, but so excessively tardy that it is perfectly useless,\u201d a collective of linguists wrote in the Liberation newspaper on Thursday.",
      "This ninth edition replaces the eighth, which was completed in 1935.  Work started in 1986, and three previous sections \u2013 up to the letter R \u2013 have already been issued.",
      "Today the end section (last entry Zzz) has been added, meaning the work is complete.",
      "In its press release, the Academy said the dictionary is a \u201cmirror of an epoch running from the 1950s up to today,\u201d and boasts  21,000 new entries compared to the 1935 version.",
      "But many of the \u201cmodern\u201d words added in the 1980s or 90s are already out of date.  And such is the pace of linguistic change, many words in current use today are too new to make it in.",
      "Thus common words like tiktokeur, vlog, smartphone and \u00e9moji \u2013 which are all in the latest commercial dictionaries \u2013 do not exist in the Acad\u00e9mie book.  Conversely its \u201cnew\u201d words include such go-ahead concepts as soda, sauna, yuppie and sup\u00e9rette (mini-supermarket).",
      "For the latest R-Z section, the writers have included the new thinking on the feminisation of jobs, including female alternatives (which did not exist before) for positions such as ambassadeur and professeur. However print versions of the earlier sections do not have the change, because for many years the Acad\u00e9mie fought a rear-guard action against it.",
      "Likewise the third section of the new dictionary \u2013 including the letter M \u2013 defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, which in France it no longer is.",
      "\u201cHow can anyone pretend that this collection can serve as a reference for anyone?\u201d the collective asks, noting that online dictionaries are both bigger and faster-moving.",
      "Under its president, the writer Amin Maalouf, the dictionary committee meets every Thursday morning and after discussion gives its ruling on definitions that have been drawn up in preliminary form by outside experts.",
      "Among the \u201cimmortals\u201d is the English poet and French expert Michael Edwards, who told Le Figaro newspaper how he tried to get the Academy to revive the long-forgotten word improfond (undeep).",
      "\u201cFrench needs it, because as every English student of French knows, there is no word for \u2018shallow\u2019,\u201d he said.  Sadly, he failed.",

That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",

Bettors will have to place a $200 wager to make a $100 profit, should the social influencer prevail over Tyson.",
      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",
      "Gamblers are backing Tyson, according to DraftKings, with 69% of all bets currently on the former undisputed world champion to emerge victorious. \"While Tyson is 58-years old now, people see one of the greatest boxers of all time at a favorable price and jump at that opportunity,\" Avello said.",
      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",
      "How to watch the Jake Paul vs. Mike Tyson fight",
      "For most fans, the best seats will be at home, with Tyson vs. Paul streaming worldwide on Netflix. A standard Netflix subscription plan with ads is $6.99 a month. The platform's broadcast starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "As reported by CBS Sports, the fight marks Netflix's biggest bet to date on live sports. Netflix, which has 282 million subscribers in over 190 countries, has recently tested the waters by airing exhibition events in golf and tennis.",

The duo had eight Top 20 hits in the 1960s and '70s, and their TV series, \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" was a ratings bonanza.",

      "PREFACE",
      "Los Angeles, Summer 1956",
      "Staring at the television open-mouthed, I let my peanut butter and jelly sandwich drop onto the plate in my lap as chills ran up and down my body.",
      "Home alone after school, I was sitting cross-legged (my favorite position, still) on the floor in front of the TV enjoying the peace and quiet and watching my favorite show, American Bandstand. \"And now, ladies and gentlemen, Ray Charles,\" Dick Clark announced as the camera panned to a handsome man in sunglasses sitting at a piano.",
      "\"Georgia, Georgia . . . ,\" he began, and I burst into tears. I couldn't believe he was singing a song about my mom. As tears dripped onto my sandwich, I'd never felt more connected to anything in my life. Ray Charles's voice and the melody seemed to express exactly how I felt.",
      "It took me weeks to get over seeing him sing, and in some ways, I never did, but then someone whose songs I first heard on the radio blew a hole in my understanding of the world and I was never, ever the same. As I stared at the TV with my mom watching The Ed Sullivan Show, a popular young singer named Elvis Presley filled the screen. Mom and I were two of the sixty million Americans who witnessed that historic performance in September 1956.",
      "Even though Elvis was dressed quite traditionally that Sunday night, he looked and moved differently than any performer I'd ever seen. He began by singing \"Don't Be Cruel,\" and by the time he broke into \"Love Me Tender,\" I felt as if he was singing only to me. I wanted to jump right into the TV and be Elvis.",
      "When I heard a year later that he was giving a concert at the Pan-Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles, I rushed home with stars in my eleven-year-old eyes. \"Mom, Mom! Elvis is going to be at the Pan-Pacific! Can we go? . . . Please?\" I was convinced that I had to be there. Secretly, I thought that he would spot me in the crowd and pick me, although I'm sure that's what every girl thought.",
      "Luckily for me, my thirty-one-year-old mother was as crazy about Elvis as I was, a fact that impressed my friends because their moms didn't approve of his raw sexuality. To this day I don't know where she found the money, but somehow Georgia did. Mom and I dressed up and made our way into town, more like sisters than mother and daughter. Feeling the tension grow the closer we got to the Fairfax District, we soon found ourselves caught up in a pulsing mob of nine thousand noisy girls.",
      "We were swept inside the auditorium on a wave of pure adrenaline. Our folding seats were about halfway back in the audience, but that was fine by me. Looking around at all the girls gazing in anticipation at the darkened stage, I could feel my heart pounding inside my flat little chest\u2014a sensation I was to become all too familiar with later in life.",
      "The stage was dark, but when the spotlights hit him, Elvis was there and he was magic. There was a roar from the crowd that was like nothing I had ever heard. An explosion of flashbulbs went off. I only wished I'd brought our little Kodak Brownie. Elvis was standing there in his famous gold suit, which was shimmering and changing color in the spotlights.",
      "He was so handsome with that amazing smile and lustrous black hair, exactly the same color as mine. Everyone around us jumped to their feet and started screaming so hysterically that we could hardly hear a word of \"Heartbreak Hotel.\" But, boy, we could see his moves\u2014the way he gyrated his hips and shook his legs so that they quivered. Not content with making as much noise as they could, the girls began jumping up onto their chairs for a better view, which meant that from then on, we could only see Elvis's head and shoulders.",
      "Being in the middle of that shrieking crowd was like being caught up in a massive swivel-hipped tidal wave, swept along with the hysteria toward the stage. I had no idea why everyone was acting so insane. I was too young to get that part of it, truthfully (but if I had been three years older and my mom had been three years younger, we would have fainted). It was the most exciting experience I'd ever had because I knew that I wanted to be on that stage in the spotlight one day too.",
      "When I looked over at my mother, she was down for the count. We were both mesmerized. She looked so beautiful dressed in some amazing outfit that of all the girls in the place, including me, I felt sure that Elvis would have picked her.",
      "Pressing my mouth to her ear so that she could hear, I cupped my hand over it and yelled, \"Mom, can we stand on our seats and scream, too?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she replied, grinning like a teenager and taking off her high heels. \"Come on, let's do it!\" So we did, straining on our tip-toes to see him.",
      "Glowing with happiness, I tried to work out if Elvis would be too old to marry me by the time I was grown, so that he could sing to me every day. Dreaming of being Mrs. Presley, I couldn't stop talking to Mom about Elvis for weeks as I floated around on a gold lam\u00e9 cloud.",

    "published": "Sun, 17 Nov 2024 10:13:14 -0500",
    "summary": "With the release of part one of her new memoir, Cher talks about her relationship - on stage and off - with Sonny Bono, and why their TV partnership survived beyond their marriage.",
    "story": [
      "It took too long for Cher to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. \"I thought, what do I have to do?\" she said. \"I've had number one records in all these decades. I had a song [\"Believe\"] that changed music forever. And so, what is it that I've gotta do?\"",
      "This year she finally made it. At her induction ceremony last month, she said, \"It was easier getting divorced from two men than it was to get into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame!\"",
      "It also took forever for Cher to write her story. This week, \"Cher: The Memoir \u2013 Part One\" finally comes out. Asked what she wanted to say with the book, she replied, \"In the beginning, I didn't wanna say much. And then at some point, I just thought, Cher, do it or give the money back.\"",
      "The book centers on her years with Sonny, and her itinerant childhood with a mother who married at least seven times. She writes of how she had to be a grownup from the beginning: \"One time we were driving in the car and she said, 'Cher, I don't know how we're gonna pay the rent. What do you think?' And I was like, 'Okay, how is this gonna work? How are we gonna do this?'\"",
      "In 1962, Cherilyn Sarkisian met Sonny Bono in a coffee shop. He was wearing a mohair suit and a mustard-colored shirt with a white collar. \"I thought it was like when Tony met Maria,\" she said. \"Everybody disappeared, and it was just the two of us.\"",
      "But she said it was not love at first sight. \"It was something,\" Cher said. \"I never felt it before.\"",
      "Sonny was 27, Cher was 16. \"It wasn't passionate; I just loved him,\" she said.",
      "What did she love about him? \"How he was different than anyone else. And he made me laugh. And we had a dream.\"",
      "That dream came true. By the mid-1960s, Sonny & Cher had five songs in the top 50 at the same time. They had a #1 hit with \"I Got You Babe.\"",
      "In the 1970s, on \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" they'd become America's favorite couple, with their banter, their songs, and that Bob Mackie wardrobe: \"And then, when they started to realize that people were tuning in because of what I was wearing, then they just gave us all the money we needed,\" she said. \"It was so much fun.\"",
      "But Sonny began to change. \"He just started not to care,\" Cher said.",
      "About what? \"About me.\"",
      "He didn't like her going out, or even talking with their band. But one member had his eye on her: A guitarist by the name of Bill. One night Cher met up with him. \"We walked back to this place where the guys used to get high before the show. And then he kissed me, and it was like, Oh, my God.\"",
      "Somehow word got back to Sonny. \"I don't know if I can actually say what happened because it's so personal, and it's so \u2026 it's embarrassing,\" Cher said.",
      "But it's in the book: After Sonny asked her what she wanted to do, Cher writes: \"I said, 'I want to sleep with Bill.' It all seems crazy now. I didn't mean it, but I thought saying those words was the only way that he would let me go.\"",
      "\"I thought if I do this, it's over,\" she said. \"He's not gonna be able to come back. We're not gonna be able to be Sonny & Cher. I just wanna blow it up. But I didn't know I wanted to blow it up until I was blowing it up.\"",
      "They offered her anything to keep up appearances: \"Because everybody was afraid I was gonna blow up the show. They just said, 'What do you want?' And I said, 'Well, I want my own place in Malibu. And I want $5,000 a month. Hello? And I want freedom.'\"",
      "But Sonny & Cher kept up the fa\u00e7ade for two more years, until Cher's new boyfriend, record executive David Geffen, got a copy of her contract, and she learned the shocking truth: \"Sonny owned 95 percent of the company and his lawyer owned five,\" she said. \"And it was called Cher Enterprises, but I own nothing! And we'd worked together for almost 12 years.\"",
      "She confronted Sonny: \"I said, 'When was the moment that you thought this would be a good idea?' And he said, 'I always knew you'd leave me.' And I said, 'That's not a reason! Son, how could you do it? I was there by your side working, all those nights, all those days, through good, through bad.' He didn't have an answer.",
      "\"And we were still friends after that,\" she said.",
      "Even after Cher married Gregg Allman and was pregnant with their son, she rejoined Sonny for a revival of their TV show.",
      "Mason asked, \"Can you explain why it was that up on that stage all the other stuff seemed to go away?\"",
      "\"Because we had fun with each other,\" Cher replied. \"And because on stage, there was no marriage. There was no discord. There was no word for our relationship. And you couldn't cut it with a chainsaw.\"",

      "Cher would go on to win an Oscar, for \"Moonstruck.\" But that's for part two of her memoir, which she still has to write.",
      "As for her music, she says she's got another album she wants to make. When? \"After I get rid of this book!\" she laughed. \"Because talking is harder on your voice than singing. And I want to record an album, and 78 is not exactly a time in your life when you want to. I hope I'm Tony Bennett!\"",

    "story": [
      "Walking through the streets of Dublin, Paul Mescal said, \"There's this weird sensation about landing into the city \u2013 I don't know, it just makes me feel calm.\"",
      "The Irish actor was not going to get much of that calm on this stop, attending the Dublin premiere of \"Gladiator II.\" He was here to promote the highly-anticipated film. \"There's a little bit of really enjoying it, but part of it also hanging on for dear life,\" he said. \"Just the size is something that I haven't experienced before. I also just haven't led a huge amount of films.\"",
      "In \"Gladiator II,\" he plays Lucius, who learns (along with the audience) of his connection to Russell Crowe's character from the original 2000 blockbuster. Nearly 25 years later, director Ridley Scott is back with the sequel, out this week.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Gladiator II\" click on the video player below:",
      "What was it like for Mescal to be in the middle of such an epic film? \"I would say equally epic,\" he replied.",
      "The 28-year-old has already been nominated for an Oscar, playing a single dad in \"Aftersun,\" and an Emmy for his role in \"Normal People.\" Aside from the critical acclaim, that series turned him into a Gen Z heartthrob practically overnight.",
      "Ridley Scott says he was so impressed with Mescal that he cast the young actor after just a 30-minute zoom call.",
      "\"I got a phone call and they were like, 'You're going to be in \"Gladiator II,\"'\" Mescal recalled. \"That's kind of massively life-altering news to receive.\"",
      "It's that big? \"Yeah, of course it is,\" Mescal said. \"I think there's something that comes with the legacy of Ridley Scott.\"",
      "The first \"Gladiator\" won five Academy Awards, including best picture. In this incarnation, from Paramount Pictures (a division of CBS' parent company), Mescal stars alongside Denzel Washington.",
      "I asked, \"As an actor, are you taking mental notes when you work with someone like Washington?\"",
      "\"When you go back to bed in the evening, you're like, 'How is he doing this? How is he doing that?'\" he replied. \"Every scene I did with him was never how I expected it to go, which is the dream. It was very thrilling to be five feet in front of his face watching him do that.\"",
      "Mescal has star power of his own, as we saw when we witnessed a sea of people following us when we met at Trinity College, where, not so long ago, he'd studied acting.",
      "He's proving to be a singular actor, at least until a recent look-a-like contest. \"I feel like it's easy to do a parody of me,\" he laughed.",
      "\"The shorts?\"",
      "\"Yeah yeah yeah.\"",
      "Those shorts are the uniform of his other love, Gaelic football. For \"Gladiator II,\" this athlete bulked-up, putting on 18 pounds of muscle.",
      "I asked, \"The role is so different. You're often playing these kind of softer, almost tormented, shy characters. It's a major transition for you.\"",
      "\"Yeah, it is,\" he replied. \"I think going back to the sport that I played before, there was definitely a desire to make a more physically-informed choice with a character Lucius represented, like, the perfect opportunity for that to happen.\"",
      "\"Normal People,\" his big break, was shot at his alma mater. In it, Mescal portrays the sharp, nuanced emotions of a student: angst, torment, desire. \"I think it exposed an audience to me,\" Mescal said. \"That job essentially allowed me to prove to people that I can act.\"",
      "The series came after he made a commercial for an Irish sausage company: \"Yeah, that covered my rent for the year. I was absolutely delighted by it.\"",
      "He'd started acting at 16, and a high school production of \"Phantom of the Opera\" changed his trajectory. \"I think I'm still chasing that feeling again,\" he said. \"Nothing has ever really come close to that feeling.\"",
      "\"Your high school 'Phantom of the Opera' production vs. 'Gladiator II'?\" I asked.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely bizarre! I think because it felt physically dangerous in my body to be exposed to an audience of people who knew me as somebody who played sports. The adrenaline was, like, extraordinary.\"",
      "His childhood, he says, was pretty standard. His mother was a policewoman, his dad a teacher, both now retired. But he credits that upbringing with helping him navigate today's pressures.",
      "\"This is new for me,\" he said, of fame.",
      "\"But you're used to attention at this point?\"",
      "\"Uh, within reason.\"",
      "On campus, at times this star was as struck as the students.",
      "Mescal is hoping to maintain some distance, some mystery as an actor, to be able to convincingly inhabit such varied roles. \"You don't want an audience to know you innately,\" he said.",
      "And what is his relationship with fame? \"Ever-changing,\" he said.",
      "Perhaps that's because it's all changing so quickly for him. Instead of dispersing during our interview inside, the crowd, we soon discovered, had multiplied. And we got to witness Paul Mescal in a role for which there is no rehearsal, and no script.",
      "\"What the hell?\" he remarked to the assembled hordes. \"I don't know what to say other than, hello! This is f*****g bananas! I have to go finish an interview \u2026 you should all go back to school. See you later!\"",

    "summary": "Jake Paul and Mike Tyson are set to fight in a major professional boxing match tonight. Here's how to watch and what time the bout starts.",
    "story": [
      "Update: Jake Paul defeated Mike Tyson in their heavyweight fight in Dallas Friday night by unanimous decision. Read more here.",
      "Former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson is set to take on YouTube sensation and current professional boxer Jake Paul in a highly anticipated heavyweight fight Friday night at the AT&T Stadium in Dallas. It will mark the first time Tyson (50-6, 44 KOs) has entered the ring for a pro bout since retiring from the sport in 2005.",
      "Paul (10-1, 7 KOs) will be fighting for the third time in 2024 in what is easily his highest-profile bout to date. The match-up between the 58-year-old Tyson and 27-year-old Paul was initially scheduled for July 20 but was rescheduled to give Tyson time to recover from medical issues stemming from a stomach ulcer.",
      "Here's what you need to know about tonight's big fight, including when and how to watch.",
      "What time is the Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul fight tonight?",
      "The Mike Tyson vs. Jake Paul televised fight card\u00a0began at 8 p.m. ET (5 p.m. PT) on Netflix. There were three professional boxing fights before Tyson and Paul were set to enter the ring. The main event will occur once those bouts have concluded with the exact timing dependent on the length of the preceding fights.",
      "How many rounds will the Tyson vs. Paul fight have?",
      "The Tyson-Paul fight is scheduled for eight, two-minute rounds. That's slightly shorter than the typical three-minute rounds most professional men's boxing fights are scheduled for. Both men will also wear heavier boxing gloves than heavyweights often do, sporting 14-ounce gloves versus the traditional 10-ounce versions.",
      "How to watch the Tyson vs. Paul fight",
      "The Tyson vs. Paul fight will be broadcast live on Netflix and will be free for subscribers.",
      "What is Mike Tyson's boxing background?",
      "Mike Tyson is one of the most famous \u2014 and infamous \u2014 boxers in sports history. A Hall of Fame inductee, Tyson burst onto the world stage in the 1980s when he became the youngest heavyweight champion in boxing history. Combining speed and power, Tyson possessed an uncanny ability to intimidate opponents before they even entered the ring. He won his first world title in 1986 and became the undisputed champion in the years that followed. He lost his belts to Buster Douglas in 1990 in one of the biggest upsets in sports history and was incarcerated on a rape conviction from 1992 to 1995.",
      "Tyson won the World Boxing Council (WBC) and World Boxing Association (WBA) titles upon his return to the ring in the mid-1990s but then lost to Evander Holyfield in a major upset in November 1996. A highly-anticipated rematch between the two in June 1997 led to Tyson getting disqualified after he bit off a chunk of Holyfield's ear.",
      "His subsequent performances in the ring after that were largely overshadowed by bizarre antics both during the fight and in between matches. He lost his final title fight against then-heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis in June 2002 and he retired following consecutive knockout losses to other opponents in 2004 and 2005. He was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. He last fought in an exhibition (non-professional) match against former champion Roy Jones Jr. in November 2020.",
      "What is Jake Paul's boxing background?",
      "Jake Paul was best known as a popular YouTuber and former Disney star before he decided to become a professional boxer in 2020. He fought his second professional fight on the undercard of Tyson's fight against Jones but has since promoted himself to main event status. Loquacious and promotable, Paul currently has 27 million followers on Instagram, 18.2 million followers on TikTok and 4.6 million on X.",
      "He's been able to morph that social media success into the boxing ring, entering tonight's fight with just a single loss against 10 wins, with seven of those victories via knockout. The lone loss came against undefeated Tommy Fury, the younger brother of former undisputed heavyweight champion Tyson Fury (who, ironically, was named after Paul's opponent tonight).",
      "Who do experts predict will win the Tyson vs. Paul fight?",
      "Expert predictions for tonight's match-up vary. Former opponents Lewis and Jones are both predicting a Tyson victory as is his namesake, Tyson Fury. Former boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya also likes Tyson but former heavyweight champ Anthony Joshua is going with Paul as is Paul's brother, Logan. Oddsmakers have had Paul as the slight favorite but the betting line has been moving more toward Tyson throughout fight week, according to ESPN.",

      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",

In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",

    "story": [
      "We were amazed at what we were seeing on a sweltering summer's day, when a group of people with Parkinson's Disease began rock-climbing on the Carderock Cliffs of Maryland. Yes, rock-climbing!",
      "It's all part of their therapy, says Molly Cupka, the no-nonsense instructor and cheerleader for this community of courageous climbers.",
      "She started this program, called UpENDing Parkinsons, as a non-profit twelve years ago.",
      "\"There's a lot of balance involved, mobility involved, strength, cardio, and then there's the cognitive part, where you have to look at the hold, and figure out how to get your body to move to get to that hold,\" she said.",
      "How often do they fall? \"Falling is definitely part of climbing,\" said Cupka. But they never really fall, because they wear a harness that provides a layer of safety. \"You're always on the rope. You fall, but you don't fall far. We always say if you're not falling, you're not trying hard enough!\"",
      "There's no cure for Parkinson's, which usually affects mobility, coordination, balance, and even speech. Jon Lessin was diagnosed in 2003. He was once an all-around athlete. About 12 years ago he retired as a cardiac anesthesiologist because of Parkinson's. His daughter, Brittany, watched his steady decline, until he discovered climbing walls as high as 60 feet!",
      "\"My dad has a hard time walking across the room, but he can make it to the top of this giant wall,\" Brittany said. \"There's a lot that he's had to give up because of his disease. But this is something that he found through it, which is really cool.\"",
      "Jon said, \"I get to the top and I feel like I've conquered something. And I feel like the wall can't beat me. I can beat the wall.\"",
      "Full disclosure: This story is very personal to me. My late husband, Aaron Latham, had Parkinson's, and boxed as a way to fight the symptoms, as he explained on \"Sunday Morning\" in 2015. \"Boxing's just the opposite of Parkinson's,\" said Latham. \"Everything's designed, instead of to shrink you, everything's designed to pump you up.\"",
      "Jon Lessin said Parkinson's \"makes you feel very small. You make small movements, you're hunched over. And [rock climbing] makes you feel like you can accomplish the world.\"",
      "It was Lessin who first had that big idea to use rock climbing as a therapy for Parkinson's. \"I wanted to do big-movement exercise,\" he said. \"And I found Molly at this gym.\"",
      "Lessin proposed the idea to Molly Cupka, who runs the Sportrock Climbing Center in Alexandria, Virginia. She thought it was worth a try, given the sport requires participants to plan ahead, to know where to position their hands and feet. \"I wish I could go into the brain and see what's happening while people climb,\" Cupka said.",
      "Some people with Parkinson's, like Vivek Puri, get dyskinesia (involuntary jerking motions). Puri said he's usually unaware of his. He runs a home building company in the D.C. area, and was only 38 when he found out he had Parkinson's. \"Fine motor skills have kind of really suffered dramatically,\" he said. \"When I don't climb for some periods of time, I get worse.\"",
      "But once he gets on the wall, he calls himself Spider-Man.",
      "\"Honestly, I climb like a monkey,\" he said. \"I get my finger strength moving, which gets my fine motor skills \u2013 maybe not back, but kind of keeps that in motion.\"",
      "There's no evidence climbing slows the progress of Parkinson's, but Cupka joined forces with Marymount University last year to study patients climbing for the first time. \"We have people literally walking and carrying weights, you know, walking and looking, multitasking,\" she said.",
      "The study found that, in so many words, if you climb, you may walk better.",

      "Marymount University's Center for Optimal Aging study on physical and psychosocial effects of rock climbing on individuals with Parkinson's disease",
      "Mark de Mulder, a musician and former director of the National Geospatial Program, doesn't need a study to prove what climbing does for him. \"It allows me to say, 'All right, take that, Parkinson's! I'm doing this!' It just makes me feel stronger, and I'm fighting it. I'm doing something about it.\"",

      "\"What I would ask of him is that he keep an open mind. We're happy to try to show as much of the data as we can. And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to engage in the dialogue,\" said Dr. Peter Marks, speaking at an event hosted by the Milken Institute in Washington, D.C., this week,\u00a0ahead of Trump's decision.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

      "With Republicans edging closer to gaining control of Congress, millions of Americans may be at risk of losing enhanced subsidies that currently underwrite the cost of health insurance bought through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, according to industry experts and the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The November 5 election gave control of the Senate to Republicans, while control of the House remains in limbo Monday as votes in several critical races continue to be tallied. Currently, Democrats are projected to win at least 210 House seats and Republicans 215 seats, with a party needing 218 seats in order to have the majority.",
      "If Republicans gain control of Congress, they are widely expected to allow the enhanced ACA subsidies to expire at the end of 2025, depriving many people who buy coverage through the ACA and who currently receive these subsidies of that financial assistance, according to health care policy experts.",
      "So-called enhanced Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies, which lower the cost of health plans for millions of Americans and were passed under the Biden administration, will expire unless lawmakers renew them. During his first term in office, President-elect Donald Trump backed efforts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the ACA, but hasn't yet revealed his plans for the program, commonly known as Obamacare, for his second term in office.",
      "Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said at a campaign stop last week just before the Nov. 5 election that \"the ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work, and we've got a lot of ideas on how to do that.\"",
      "Who is eligible for enhanced ACA subsidies?",
      "Americans with incomes over 400% of poverty \u2014 those who make just above four times the poverty level, or $103,280 for a family of four \u2014 are eligible for the enhanced ACA insurance subsidies. They also increase financial help for those who were already eligible for assistance under the ACA.",
      "KFF, an independent health policy nonprofit, estimates\u00a0the subsidies have cut premiums for eligible enrollees by 44%, or $705 annually. The organization says that if the tax credit expires, average premiums for subsidized enrollees in 12 states would at least double.",
      "In 2024, of the 21.6 million Americans who purchased health insurance plans from ACA marketplaces, 20.1 million received enhanced subsidies,\u00a0according\u00a0to the CBO.",
      "People most at risk of losing ACA coverage if the enhanced subsidies lapse are those who live in states where health insurance premiums are particularly high, including in rural parts of the U.S. Middle-income households that depend on the enhanced subsidies could see a sharp rise in premiums, Cynthia Cox, vice president and ACA policy researcher at KFF, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"They could go from paying no more than 8.5% of their income to easily paying 20% or more,\" she said. \"I imagine a lot of those folks would drop coverage.\"",
      "Without enhances subsidies, many middle income ACA Marketplace enrollees with incomes just above four times poverty would be priced out of health insurance coverage, according to Cox.",
      "Subsidies remain for 2025",
      "Louise Norris, a health policy analyst at\u00a0healthinsurance.org, noted that 93% of people who buy health insurance through ACA marketplaces receive enhanced subsidies. A sharp increase in their premiums would lead many to drop their coverage, leaving them uninsured, she said.",
      "The CBO\u00a0estimates\u00a0that 22.8 million total Americans will enroll in ACA marketplace health insurance plans in 2025. The agency expects enrollment to drop sharply, from 22.8 million to 18.9 million, in 2026 if the subsidies are not renewed. By 2030, enrollment could dip to 15.4 million people without the enhanced subsidies.",
      "For now, the subsidy enhancements will remain in place through the end of 2025.",
      "\"If people are signing up now during open enrollment, their coverage will take effect in January, and it will cover them for the whole year. Their premiums won't change \u2014 they're good for 2025,\" Norris said.",
      "The enhanced subsidies, which were first passed in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, will have been in place for roughly five years when they expire in 2025, or about half as long as the ACA marketplace has existed, Cox said.",
      "Enrollment in ACA plans has roughly doubled since the enhance subsidies have been in place, she noted, with most of that growth coming from low-income enrollees. \"That's one group you might expect to see, if they have to start making a higher premium payments, would drop their coverage,\" she said.",

    "summary": "Overdose deaths have slowed 18% since a peak last year, the CDC estimates.",
    "story": [
      "Opioid overdose deaths have now slowed to the lowest levels nationwide since 2020, according to new estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This marks the 12th straight month of decline since a peak last year.",
      "Around 70,655 deaths linked to opioids like heroin and fentanyl were reported for the year ending June 2024, the CDC now estimates, falling 18% from the same time in 2023.",
      "Almost all states, except for a handful in the West from Alaska through Nevada, are now seeing a significant decrease in overdose death rates. Early data from Canada also suggests overdose deaths there might now be slowing off of a peak in 2023 too.",
      "\"While these data are cause for optimism, we must not lose sight of the fact that nearly 100,000 people are still estimated to be dying annually from drug overdose in the U.S.\" said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, in a statement.",
      "Other types of drug overdoses beyond opioids are also slowing. While they make up a smaller share of overall deaths, overdoses linked to drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine are also showing signs of dropping nationwide following a peak last year.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this data, but boy, it is time to double down on the things that we know are working. It is not a time to pull back, and I feel very strongly, and our data shows, that the threat continues to evolve,\" Dr. Allison Arwady, head of the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, told CBS News.",
      "Arwady pointed to a long list of factors that officials hope are contributing to the decline, ranging from broader availability of the overdose reversing spray naloxone, also known as Narcan, to efforts to ease gaps in access to medications that can treat opioid use disorder.",
      "Trends in what health officials call \"primary prevention\" have also improved in recent years \u2014 meaning fewer people using the drugs to begin with. As an example, Arwady cited CDC surveys showing a clear decline in high school students reporting that they have tried illegal drugs.",
      "The CDC and health departments have also gotten faster at gathering and analyzing data to respond to surges in overdoses, Arwady said, often caused by new so-called \"adulterants\" that are mixed in. Health authorities study this by testing blood and drug samples taken in the wake of surges, in search of potential emerging drug threats.",
      "Agency researchers are now looking closer at what could be behind gaps in communities that are still not seeing slowdowns, Arwady said.",
      "\"Unfortunately, for the most affected groups, namely Native Americans and Black American men, the death rates are not decreasing and are at the highest recorded levels,\" said Volkow.",
      "Why are drug overdose deaths declining?",
      "In the months since CDC data first began showing real signs of a nationwide change to the deadly record wave of opioid overdose deaths, experts have floated a number of theories to explain what caused the change.",
      "\"We had been seeing the numbers go down, on the national aggregate level, since last April, and we were skeptical and kind of holding our tongues. Then we started hearing from a lot of folks on the ground, frontline providers,'\" said Nabarun Dasgupta, a senior scientist at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill who studies opioid overdose deaths.",
      "Dasgupta led an analysis in September by the university's Opioid Data Lab illustrating the nationwide scope of the downturn and probing a number of theories that might explain it.",
      "Some explanations they dismissed as unlikely, like stepped-up law enforcement operations. Other ideas they judged as plausible, but complicated to prove, like a so-called \"depletion of susceptibles\" \u2014 essentially the epidemic burning itself out, as users either found ways to survive the influx of fentanyl or died \u2014 or the wider availability of naloxone.",
      "Dasgupta said they received a flood of interest since their initial post proposing more theories, like new scanners that were deployed on the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "There are likely a number of factors all playing a role in the shift, Dasgupta says. But he said early data from research they are wrapping up now supports one leading explanation: a shift in the illegal drug supply.",
      "\"Our hypothesis is that something has changed in the drug supply. This kind of pronounced shift, something that happens suddenly, if numbers had suddenly shot up, we would definitely be pointing to a change in the drug supply to explain it,\" said Dasgupta.",

    "summary": "Concerns about 23andMe's business prospects is raising questions about the genetic testing company's customer data.",
    "story": [
      "23andMe, the struggling ancestry tracing company, continues to spiral, raising questions about its business prospects and what could happen to its sensitive customer genetic testing data.",
      "23andMe on Tuesday announced it is slashing 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan. The move comes after its entire board resigned in September. Its stock price has since plunged, prompting speculation that the company could be acquired by another buyer and sparking concern among customers about the security of their genetic information.",
      "CEO Anne Wojcicki has said she intends to take the company private and is not considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "Customer data collected from its genetic testing tools makes up the company's most valuable asset. Because 23andMe is not a health care company, health privacy laws don't apply, raising questions about what the business might opt to do with its 15 million users' personal genetic data.",
      "Under 23andMe's current user agreement, users must opt-in to allow the company to share their personal DNA or data. The agreement states that if the company is acquired, customers' data may be accessed or sold as part of such a transaction.",
      "23andMe told CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady that while there are no plans for a sale, the current privacy agreement would apply.",
      "Meanwhile, at least 11 states have passed privacy laws that would require customers' consent before their genetic data is transferred.",
      "Still, experts say a new owner could change 23andMe's privacy terms following a sale, potentially putting the onus on consumers to push back against any move to share their data.",
      "23andMe said that roughly 80% of its customers consent to participate in the company's research program, which it said has generated more than 270 peer-reviewed publications uncovering new genetic insights into disease. Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",
      "Still, users can can take additional steps to protect their data, including deleting their 23andMe accounts \u2014 a process that is automated and straightforward.",
      "\"If, at any time, you are no longer interested in participating in our Services, you may delete your 23andMe account directly within your Account Settings,\" the company states on its website.",
      "That requires you to log in to your account and submit a request. The company then emails you a data deletion request confirmation, which you must verify.",
      "\"They'll get rid of your sample, they'll delete all of your personal information and they will close the account,\" O'Grady said.",
      "23andMe, which went public in 2021, has struggled to generate profits, with most buyers of its saliva-based testing kits only needing to make a single purchase. The company reported a net loss of $667 million for its last fiscal year, more than double the loss of $312 million for the year prior.",
      "23andMe posted another loss in quarterly earnings released Tuesday. The company reported a net loss of $59.1 million for the 2025 fiscal year's second quarter, compared to a loss of $75.3 million for the same year prior.",

      "Last year's round of COVID-19 vaccines did not get off the ground in many places until late September, long after providers had already begun offering flu shots. CDC officials said that led to confusing messaging and logistical fumbles that may have hampered vaccination rates.",

By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 12:20:26 -0500",
    "summary": "The budget carrier Spirit Airlines is trying to recover from the pandemic drop in travel and failed mergers.",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines said Monday that it's filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel and failed attempts to sell itself to other carriers.",
      "Spirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion over the next year, obligations it was unlikely to be able to meet.",
      "The move was widely expected.",
      "Spirit said it expects to operate as normal as it works its way through a \"prearranged, streamlined\" Chapter 11 bankruptcy process and that customers can continue to book and fly without interruption.",
      "The Chapter 11 process itself won't impact Spirit employee's wages or benefits, the airline said.",
      "Shares of Miramar, Florida-based Spirit dropped 25% on Friday after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. It was just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.",
      "CEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. He called the discussions a priority and said the airline was trying to get the best deal it could as quickly as possible.",
      "\"The chatter in the market about Spirit is notable, but we are not distracted,\" he told investors during an earnings call. \"We are focused on refinancing our debt, improving our overall liquidity position, deploying our new reimagined product into the market, and growing our loyalty programs.\"",
      "People are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They're just not paying as much.",
      "In the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they're paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit's red ink.",
      "It's not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded.",
      "What's been ailing Spirit",
      "There are several reasons behind the slump.",
      "Spirit's costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit's budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit's core business \u2014 have sagged because of a glut of new flights.",
      "The premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit's traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. That was a huge change from Spirit's longtime strategy of luring customers with rock-bottom fares and forcing them to pay extra for things such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.",
      "Airline industry analyst Henry Harteveldt pointed out to CBS News that, on one hand, some people \"are saying, 'You know what? I'm doing better than I thought financially and I can afford maybe to upgrade to an airline that has extra leg room or something like that.' And Spirit has missed that opportunity.\"",
      "On the other hand, Harteveldt notes, lots of Spirit's customers \"haven't been able to afford to fly to the same extent that they used to because of the higher cost of everyday living.\"",
      "In a highly unusual move, Spirit plans to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20% compared with the same period last year, which analysts say should help prop up fares. But that will help rivals more than it will boost Spirit. Analysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.",
      "Spirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines that are forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.",
      "Spirit said in an October regulatory filing that it had identified about $80 million of cost-cutting measures set to begin early next year, according to\u00a0CBS News Miami. Those cuts will be driven primarily by a \"reduction in workforce,\" the Florida-based airline noted. The carrier also disclosed that it had agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for about $519 million.",
      "Mergers didn't materialize",
      "The aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.",
      "Frontier Airlines tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.",
      "U.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.",
      "The last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013.",

      "Here's what we know about how much Paul and Tyson were being paid, along with other financial aspects of an event that many consider more spectacle than sport.",
      "How much is Mike Tyson getting paid for the fight?",
      "Regarded as one of the greatest boxers of all time, 58-year-old Mike Tyson has an estimated net worth of $10 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. That is a modest sum compared with the hundreds of millions of dollars \"Iron Mike,\" as he is known, accumulated in career earnings, including $400 million in fight purses, according\u00a0to\u00a0Forbes. Over the last decade, Tyson has also fought his way back after filing for bankruptcy in 2003.",

      "That's about the same dollar amount Tyson earned in his match against Michael Spinks in 1988, a record purse at the time (worth roughly $53 million today adjusting for inflation). That bout lasted less than two minutes, with Tyson knocking out the previously undefeated Spinks in 91 seconds.",
      "In 1992, Tyson was sent to prison for six years after being convicted of raping a teenage beauty-pageant contestant. He was released on parole after three and a half years, returning to boxing in 1995 in a match against Peter McNeely, who was dispatched by a technical knockout in under 90 seconds.",

Tyson was disqualified from the fight, had his boxing license revoked and fined $3 million, but was allowed to keep the purse.",
      "At a news conference on Wednesday, Paul wore a diamond-spiked ear cover, a pointed reference to the incident. But when it comes to making light of the ear biting, Tyson has beat Paul to the punch, having launched ear-shaped marijuana edibles\u00a0(with Holyfield's consent) through his company, Tyson 2.0, a premium cannabis brand he launched in 2021. The brand generated an estimated $150 million in revenue in 2023, according to Forbes Australia.",

      "Jake Paul, 27, is set to earn $40 million, according to an estimate from DraftKings Network and other sources \u2014 double what Tyson is expected to receive for the fight. A simple explanation for that may be that Paul, a top social influencer with 27 million followers on Instagram alone, is also co-founder of Most Valuable Promotions (MVP), the company promoting the extravaganza in partnership with Netflix. His net worth is estimated at $80 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.",
      "With a 10-1 fight record, mostly against\u00a0mixed martial artists and other pro-boxing newcomers under his belt, Paul, a former child star and YouTube prankster who began his boxing career in 2018, does not lack confidence \u2014 or showmanship. His cocky attitude earned him his latest nickname \"El Gallo de Dorado\" or the Golden Rooster, coined by fans in Puerto Rico. Before that, he was called \"The Problem Child,\" a fairly self-explanatory moniker based on the online persona he's crafted for himself over the years.",
      "Paul, who went full Gallo at an open training session this week with Tyson at the Toyota Music Factory in Irving, Texas, donning a rooster hat and red-feathered skirt over his boxing trunks, epitomizes social media's melding of Barnumesque entertainment and sports.",
      "In a TikTok video posted Tuesday, a shirtless Paul, slumped on a couch wearing a prosthetic belly to make himself look out of shape, places stacks of money on his protruding stomach while offering \"Mikey, Mikey\" an additional $5 million if the former champion can last more than four rounds with him in the ring. If he doesn't, says Paul in the video, the aging boxer will have to get a tattoo that says \"I love Jake Paul.\"",
      "\"This is why modern boxing is a joke,\"commented one user on Reddit in reaction to the video. \"People get more excited about freak show fights than actual boxing matches.\"",

Bettors will have to place a $200 wager to make a $100 profit, should the social influencer prevail over Tyson.",
      "\"There has been a lot of anticipation for this fight, and we have been pleased with the betting volume,\" Johnny Avello, director of sports operations at DraftKings, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"We expect more action to come in the hours leading up to the fight.\"",
      "Although it remains to be seen how much will be wagered in total, the event is attracting some whale-sized bets of $500,000, according to ESPN.",
      "Gamblers are backing Tyson, according to DraftKings, with 69% of all bets currently on the former undisputed world champion to emerge victorious. \"While Tyson is 58-years old now, people see one of the greatest boxers of all time at a favorable price and jump at that opportunity,\" Avello said.",
      "\"While it won't match up to an event like the Super Bowl, it could certainly be our most bet boxing match of the year,\" he added.",
      "Not everyone will be able to place a bet the epic bout. Though the fight is sanctioned by Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation, changes in the rules, including\u00a0shorter rounds and bigger gloves, disqualifies the fight from being bet on in at least seven U.S.\u00a0states.",

      "For most fans, the best seats will be at home, with Tyson vs. Paul streaming worldwide on Netflix. A standard Netflix subscription plan with ads is $6.99 a month. The platform's broadcast starts at 8 p.m. Eastern time.",
      "As reported by CBS Sports, the fight marks Netflix's biggest bet to date on live sports. Netflix, which has 282 million subscribers in over 190 countries, has recently tested the waters by airing exhibition events in golf and tennis.",

    "story": [
      "With President-elect Donald Trump vowing to pull the plug on the $7,500 tax credit for buyers of electric vehicles, one EV maker and its billionaire owner are fully behind the idea and even stand to profit from it.",
      "\"Take away the subsidies, it will only help Tesla,\" Tesla owner Elon Musk posted in July on X, the social media platform he owns.",
      "The credit granted to buyers of EVs helped make the case for buying the climate-friendlier vehicles, and when an earlier version of the tax credit was done away with several years ago, Tesla cut prices on its cars by about half of the credit its buyers were no longer receiving.",
      "Tesla is the sole automaker to be generating a profit on its U.S. sales. Manufacturing EVs is a losing proposition for Big Three vehicle makers like Ford and General Motors, who sell a fraction of EVs compared with Tesla.",
      "Once the EV tax credit is vanquished, the price of EVs overall might drop, cutting into Tesla's profits, as opposed to increasing the company's red ink as it could for legacy automakers still working to get a firmer footing in the EV market. Should traditional automakers scale back on their EV production and sales to curtail the losses, EV shoppers would have even fewer options, benefiting Tesla.",
      "As Musk touted his support for axing the EV tax credit, Tesla's auto industry rivals signaled the opposite.",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation urged that the tax credit continue, telling lawmakers in an October letter that U.S. manufacturers count on it as they vie with Chinese EV production. Around the world, vehicle makers have poured billions into transitioning to electric cars.",
      "Further, the Zero Emission Transportation Association on Friday called on Trump to reconsider, saying the tax credit has bolstered employment in states that voted Republican, including Ohio, Kentucky, Michigan and Georgia.",
      "\"If the United States is going to continue to fight to bring those jobs here and actually compete to win against China, there needs to be a demand signal \u2014 like the New Clean Vehicle Tax Credit \u2014 aligned with that goal, otherwise we would be undercutting those investments and hurting American job growth,\" ZETA Executive Director Albert Gore stated on Friday.",
      "\"The potential elimination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles by the Trump administration \u2014 without another form of incentive to replace it \u2014 could derail the trajectory of EV sales in the United States,\" offered Edmunds analysts.",
      "Trump repeatedly vowed to eliminate what he labeled President Joe Biden's \"EV mandate\" as he campaigned for the White House.",
      "While there is no such mandate in federal law, the Inflation Reduction Act passed during President Biden's term revived the credit for many EV purchases, while also granting low interest loans to manufacturers constructing EV and battery plants.",
      "Trump's transition team intends to knock out the credit as part of a broader tax-reform measure, according to a Thursday report by Reuters, which cited two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.",
      "The president-elect during his first term attempted to repeal the EV tax credit, which was expanded by President Biden in 2022.",
      "Analysts who track Tesla concurred with Musk's view that the credit's demise would only help his company.",
      "\"This is a clear negative for the EV industry at first look and would particularly hurt GM, Ford, Stellantis and Rivian,\" wrote Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives. Conversely, \"this will enable Tesla to further fend off competition from Detroit as pricing/scale/scope is an apples-to-oranges when compared to the rest of the auto industry once the EV tax credit disappears.\"",
      "Americans looking to buy an electric car should do so sooner rather than later, advised Ivan Drury, Edmunds' director Insights.",
      "\"The federal tax credit combined with slashed prices due to slowed sales momentum has contributed to electric vehicles becoming labeled as some of the best deals on the market in 2024. Now, with production cuts shrinking supply and a fresh wave of demand from those seeking a deal while they still can, it can be all but assured that the price for that EV you've been eyeing is going up in the coming months,\" Drury stated.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 18:24:10 -0500",
    "summary": "The Social Security Fairness Act, which would increase benefits for 2.8 million retirees, has bipartisan support but time running out.",
    "story": [
      "Efforts to get the Senate to vote on a bill to expand Social Security benefits are intensifying, as the House-passed Social Security Fairness Act enjoys rare bipartisan support but has only a short window of time \u2014 six weeks \u2014 to be passed.",
      "\"We're guardedly optimistic,\" Shannon Benton executive director of The Senior Citizens League, or TSCL, an advocacy group devoted to protecting retirement benefits, said. \"There is so much momentum, if it doesn't get passed now, a lot of people will lose hope.\"",
      "Decades in the making, the legislation would eliminate a provision that reduces Social Security payments to some retirees who also collect a pension from jobs that aren't covered by the retirement program, such as state and federal workers including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. It would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members.",
      "Various forms of the measure have been introduced over the years, but like many legislative proposals, they had failed to get enacted.",
      "\"I've been working at the league 25 years, and I don't remember ever not having a version,\" said Benton.",
      "Introduced by Reps. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., and Garret Graves, R-La., the bill was passed by the House in a 327-75 vote late Tuesday night, after a last-ditch effort to derail it by members of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus failed.",
      "The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "What happens next to the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "Despite having 62 cosponsors in the Senate, the bill still needs to be brought up for a vote by the chamber's leadership, and soon.",
      "The bill \"dies December 31, at the end of the second session of Congress,\" Benton said. \"Not only would this bill have to start from scratch, but a new person would have to introduce it.\"",
      "The Republican and Democratic lawmakers who introduced the measures in their respective bodies either did not run for reelection or lost their reelection bid, as was the case with Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, who introduced the bill in the Senate.",
      "If the Social Security Fairness Act comes up for a vote in the Senate, it's expected to pass, having already secured 62 co-sponsors \u2014 surpassing the majority needed to send it to President Joe Biden for his signature.",
      "If signed into law, the changes would be effective for benefits payable after December 2023.",
      "What does the Social Security Fairness Act do?",
      "The legislation would cut two provisions that curtail retirement payments for public workers and their surviving spouses and family members, the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which Spanberger and Graves argue are tantamount to theft of those workers' benefits.",
      "\"For more than 40 years, the Social Security trust funds have been artificially propped up by stolen benefits that millions of Americans paid for and that their families deserve,\" they said in a Nov. 13 statement.",
      "As things stand now, the WEP reduces the Social Security benefits of workers who also receive a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For instance, that would include teachers who don't earn Social Security through their public school positions but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs that are covered by Social Security, even though they pay into the system over enough quarters to qualify.",
      "The GPO impacts the spousal benefits of people who work for federal, state or local governments \u2014 including police officers, firefighters and teachers \u2014 if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO cuts by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension, often offsetting benefits entirely.",
      "For instance, under the GPO, someone who receives a $900 spousal benefit from Social Security but who also has a $1,000 non-covered pension would see their Social Security benefit cut by $667. That would leave them with a $233 remaining spousal benefit from Social Security.",
      "Under the Social Security Fairness Act, the same person would receive the entire $900 spousal benefit.",
      "\"Workers should be able to count on the retirement benefits they've earned,\" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, an original cosponsor of the bill. \"It's time to pass the Social Security Fairness Act so government workers and their families and people with disabilities are not punished for earning multiple sources of retirement income.\"",
      "What is the chance of the Social Security Fairness Act passing?",
      "The biggest opposition to the bill is its cost. The Congressional Budget Office estimates it would cost upward of $190 billion over a decade.",
      "\"It would hasten the combined trust funds shortfall by six months to a year, when it's already in trouble,\" said Benton, who said TSCL supports reforming Social Security to resolve its projected insolvency in 2033 to 2034.",
      "\"The long-term solvency of Social Security is an issue that Congress must address \u2014 but an issue that is wholly separate from allowing Virginians, Louisianans, and Americans across our country who did their part and contributed their earnings to retire with dignity,\" Graves and Spanberger said in their joint statement.",

    "published": "Fri, 15 Nov 2024 11:03:39 -0500",
    "summary": "Pregnant women say health care providers are billing them to deliver their babies earlier than expected. Patient advocates say that's unethical.",
    "story": [
      "In April, just 12 weeks into her pregnancy, Kathleen Clark was standing at the receptionist window of her OB-GYN's office when she was asked to pay $960, the total the office estimated she would owe after she delivered.",
      "Clark, 39, was shocked that she was asked to pay that amount during this second prenatal visit. Normally, patients receive the bill after insurance has paid its part, and for pregnant women that's usually only when the pregnancy ends. It would be months before the office filed the claim with her health insurer.",
      "Clark said she felt stuck. The Cleveland, Tennessee, obstetrics practice was affiliated with a birthing center where she wanted to deliver. Plus, she and her husband had been wanting to have a baby for a long time. And Clark was emotional, because just weeks earlier her mother had died.",
      "\"You're standing there at the window, and there's people all around, and you're trying to be really nice,\" recalled Clark, through tears. \"So, I paid it.\"",
      "On online baby message boards and other social media forums, pregnant women say they are being asked by their providers to pay out-of-pocket fees earlier than expected. The practice is legal, but patient advocacy groups call it unethical. Medical providers argue that asking for payment up front ensures they get compensated for their services.",
      "How frequently this happens is hard to track because it is considered a private transaction between the provider and the patient. Therefore, the payments are not recorded in insurance claims data and are not studied by researchers.",
      "Patients, medical billing experts, and patient advocates say the billing practice causes unexpected anxiety at a time of already heightened stress and financial pressure. Estimates can sometimes be higher than what a patient might ultimately owe and force people to fight for refunds if they miscarry or the amount paid was higher than the final bill.",
      "Up-front payments also create hurdles for women who may want to switch providers if they are unhappy with their care. In some cases, they may cause women to forgo prenatal care altogether, especially in places where few other maternity care options exist.",
      "It's \"holding their treatment hostage,\" said Caitlin Donovan, a senior director at the Patient Advocate Foundation.",
      "Medical billing and women's health experts believe OB-GYN offices adopted the practice to manage the high cost of maternity care and the way it is billed for in the U.S.",
      "When a pregnancy ends, OB-GYNs typically file a single insurance claim for routine prenatal care, labor, delivery, and, often, postpartum care. That practice of bundling all maternity care into one billing code began three decades ago, said Lisa Satterfield, senior director of health and payment policy at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. But such bundled billing has become outdated, she said.",
      "Previously, pregnant patients had been subject to copayments for each prenatal visit, which might lead them to skip crucial appointments to save money. But the Affordable Care Act now requires all commercial insurers to fully cover certain prenatal services. Plus, it's become more common for pregnant women to switch providers, or have different providers handle prenatal care, labor, and delivery \u2014 especially in rural areas where patient transfers are common.",
      "Some providers say prepayments allow them to spread out one-time payments over the course of the pregnancy to ensure that they are compensated for the care they do provide, even if they don't ultimately deliver the baby.",
      "\"You have people who, unfortunately, are not getting paid for the work that they do,\" said Pamela Boatner, who works as a midwife in a Georgia hospital.",
      "While she believes women should receive pregnancy care regardless of their ability to pay, she also understands that some providers want to make sure their bill isn't ignored after the baby is delivered. New parents might be overloaded with hospital bills and the costs of caring for a new child, and they may lack income if a parent isn't working, Boatner said.",
      "In the U.S., having a baby can be expensive. People who obtain health insurance through large employers pay an average of nearly $3,000 out-of-pocket for pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum care, according to the Peterson-KFF Health System Tracker. In addition, many people are opting for high-deductible health insurance plans, leaving them to shoulder a larger share of the costs. Of the 100 million U.S. people with health care debt, 12% attribute at least some of it to maternity care, according to a 2022 KFF poll.",
      "Families need time to save money for the high costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and child care, especially if they lack paid maternity leave, said Joy Burkhard, CEO of the Policy Center for Maternal Mental Health, a Los Angeles-based policy think tank. Asking them to prepay \"is another gut punch,\" she said. \"What if you don't have the money? Do you put it on credit cards and hope your credit card goes through?\"",
      "Calculating the final costs of childbirth depends on multiple factors, such as the timing of the pregnancy, plan benefits, and health complications, said Erin Duffy, a health policy researcher at the University of Southern California's Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. The final bill for the patient is unclear until a health plan decides how much of the claim it will cover, she said.",
      "But sometimes the option to wait for the insurer is taken away.",
      "During Jamie Daw's first pregnancy in 2020, her OB-GYN accepted her refusal to pay in advance because Daw wanted to see the final bill. But in 2023, during her second pregnancy, a private midwifery practice in New York told her that since she had a high-deductible plan, it was mandatory to pay $2,000 spread out with monthly payments.",
      "Daw, a health policy researcher at Columbia University, delivered in September 2023 and got a refund check that November for $640 to cover the difference between the estimate and the final bill.",
      "\"I study health insurance,\" she said. \"But, as most of us know, it's so complicated when you're really living it.\"",
      "While the Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some prenatal services, it doesn't prohibit providers from sending their final bill to patients early. It would be a challenge politically and practically for state and federal governments to attempt to regulate the timing of the payment request, said Sabrina Corlette, a co-director of the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. Medical lobbying groups are powerful and contracts between insurers and medical providers are proprietary.",
      "Because of the legal gray area, Lacy Marshall, an insurance broker at Rapha Health and Life in Texas, advises clients to ask their insurer if they can refuse to prepay their deductible. Some insurance plans prohibit providers in their network from requiring payment up front.",
      "If the insurer says they can refuse to pay up front, Marshall said, she tells clients to get established with a practice before declining to pay, so that the provider can't refuse treatment.",
      "Clark said she met her insurance deductible after paying for genetic testing, extra ultrasounds, and other services out of her health care flexible spending account. Then she called her OB-GYN's office and asked for a refund.",
      "\"I got my spine back,\" said Clark, who had previously worked at a health insurer and a medical office. She got an initial check for about half the $960 she originally paid.",
      "In August, Clark was sent to the hospital after her blood pressure spiked. A high-risk pregnancy specialist \u2014 not her original OB-GYN practice \u2014 delivered her son, Peter, prematurely via emergency cesarean section at 30 weeks.",
      "It was only after she resolved most of the bills from the delivery that she received the rest of her refund from the other OB-GYN practice.",
      "This final check came in October, just days after Clark brought Peter home from the hospital, and after multiple calls to the office. She said it all added stress to an already stressful period.",
      "\"Why am I having to pay the price as a patient?\" she said. \"I'm just trying to have a baby.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 21:45:03 -0500",
    "summary": "Billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy will head an effort, dubbed DOGE, to reduce wasteful federal spending. Here's what it's about.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump is vowing to reduce wasteful federal spending by tapping two billionaires \u2014 Tesla CEO Elon Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy \u2014 to spearhead the initiative, which the president-elect is calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.",
      "The appointments, announced by Trump on Tuesday, raise a host of questions about the effort, including whether Musk and Ramaswamy will have the authority to make changes in federal outlays, given that Congress authorizes the nation's spending, as well as where the businessmen might look to cut spending. Under the plan, meanwhile, DOGE is not an official government department, raising questions about its powers and how it will operate.",
      "Speaking Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago at a gala hosted by the right-leaning think tank the America First Policy Institute, Ramaswamy thanked Trump \"for making sure that Elon Musk and I are in a position to start the mass deportations of millions of unelected federal bureaucrats out of the D.C. bureaucracy.\"",
      "\"And I don't know if you've got to know Elon yet, but he doesn't bring a chisel, he brings a chainsaw, and we're going to be taking it to that bureaucracy,\" Ramaswamy added. \"It's going to be a lot of fun.\"",
      "The announcement comes a week after Trump won a second term\u00a0as president, with voters expressing their dissatisfaction with the economy under the Biden administration. As part of his campaign vows, Trump promised to slash government spending. Musk's bio on X, the social media platform he bought in 2022, now reads, \"The people voted for major government reform.\"",
      "\"Frankly, it does need to be done again, so every few decades you really need to look at everything,\" Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution who managed the Clinton Administration's National Performance Review, an effort to cut government spending in the 1990s, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But Kamarck harbors reservations about Musk and Ramaswamy's mandate, especially after the former recently suggested he could find more than $2 trillion in savings \u2014 almost one-third of the federal government's $6.7 trillion in annual spending. Two-thirds of that spending is mandatory through programs including Social Security and Medicare, while discretionary spending is largely spent on defense.",
      "\"This is the first warning sign that this is going to be a failed operation,\" Kamarck said. \"That's insane.\"",
      "Speaking on transformational change within government and organizations, Michael Morris, a professor at Columbia University's Columbia Business School, noted there are two models: a bottom-up, grassroots effort and a top-down strategy \u2014 sometimes called a shock-change approach. DOGE likely belongs to the latter, according to Morris, who is also author of the nonfiction book \"Tribal,\" about how people form and relate to each other through group dynamics.",
      "\"Unless you have a new leader with incredible legitimacy and the status quo with no legitimacy, you rarely have people responding well to shock therapy,\" he said. \"It's hard to see it happening in this case \u2014 I don't think Musk is going to be able to form a deep knowledge of government.\"",
      "The Trump campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Here's what to know about the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "What is the Department of Government Efficiency?",
      "Trump announced the DOGE in a statement on Tuesday, describing it as an effort to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.\"",
      "The name is a nod to Musk's support for a cryptocurrency called dogecoin, which was created as a joke by two software engineers and uses the image of a smiling Shiba Inu dog. (Dogecoin has more than tripled in price during the last month, and now trades at 38 cents.)",
      "Trump said Musk and Ramaswamy's work \"will conclude no later than July 4, 2026,\" or by the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump only outlined the initiative's contours and didn't disclose how it will be staffed or funded. The Trump campaign didn't respond to a request about the DOGE's funding or whether Musk or Ramaswamy will be paid for their work on the effort.",
      "On Thursday, an X account for DOGE said the group is accepting resumes from \"super high-IQ small-government revolutionaries willing to work 80+ hours per week on unglamorous cost-cutting.\" In a separate post, Musk said \"compensation is zero.\"",
      "Can the DOGE actually cut federal spending?",
      "At the moment, that appears unlikely given that the DOGE isn't a real government department, which would need to be created by congressional approval. Federal spending is authorized by Congress, and senators and House representatives may hesitate to support cuts to major programs like Social Security or Medicare, which are popular with millions of voters, or to the nation's military.",
      "It's also not clear how the organization will operate. It could come under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which dictates how external groups that advise the government must operate and be accountable to the public.",
      "Trump described Musk and Ramaswamy's role as providing \"advice and guidance from outside of government.\"",
      "That doesn't amount to much, Kamarck said.",
      "\"They have no authority \u2014 none whatsoever,\" she added, while noting that the backing of the president can help convince lawmakers to throw their support behind efficiency efforts.",
      "However, Trump's aides are reportedly working on a way to enact some of DOGE's spending recommendations without requiring congressional approval, the Washington Post reported.",
      "What have Musk and Ramaswamy said about federal spending?",
      "Musk, the world's richest person with a net worth of $319 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, has described the U.S. government as bloated and said it its spending is unsustainable. The Tesla founder also said he wants to reduce the number of federal agencies to 99, down from more than 400.",
      "\"There are so many [agencies] that people have never heard of, and that have overlapping areas of responsibilities,\" Musk\u00a0said earlier this month.",
      "While on the campaign trail with Trump, Musk also\u00a0said\u00a0he could cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the annual budget. \"Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency will fix that,\" Musk said.",
      "Musk is known for cost-cutting at his own companies, slashing\u00a0most of X's workforce after he bought the business two years ago as well as focusing on manufacturing costs at Tesla. Even so, those efforts have had mixed results, with X's valuation falling by about 80% since his purchase. Tesla's stock price, meanwhile, has surged 48% in the past year, bumping its value above $1 trillion.",
      "Ramaswamy, whom Forbes says has a net worth of about $1 billion, dropped out of the presidential race in January after running on an \"anti-woke\"\u00a0campaign. He also advocated for government cuts by eliminating the Department of Education, a goal shared by President-elect Trump.",
      "Have administrations previously tried to cut costs?",
      "Yes, both Republican and Democratic presidents have created efforts to cut government spending.",
      "In 1982, President Ronald Reagan created the Grace Commission, led by wealthy businessman J. Peter Grace, the CEO of W. R. Grace & Company, a chemicals business. About 150 business people volunteered for the commission, which ultimately recommended 2,500 reforms, according to the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library.",
      "\"Most of the recommendations, especially those requiring legislation from Congress, were never implemented,\" the library notes. \"However, the Commission's work provided a starting point for many conservative critiques of the federal government.\"",
      "In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton created the National Performance Review with the goal to create a government that would work better and cost less, Kamarck said. The group was staffed with civil servants who understood the bureaucracy, and many of whom had frustrations with it, she added.",
      "The group had some successes in streamlining operations and paring costs, eventually cutting more than 300,000 jobs, according to a study from the Congressional Research Service. Kamarck noted that the group also focused on integrating technology into departments at a time when the internet was just emerging, leading to efficiencies such as online tax filing.",
      "Where could the Trump administration cut spending?",
      "While experts are skeptical of Musk's claim he can cut $2 trillion in spending, they also point out there are opportunities to look at efficiencies.",
      "Eliminating Medicare fraud is one area that could result in savings, according to the Citizens Against Government Waste, a nonpartisan group that looks at government spending. Its recommendations also include reducing the nation's contributions to the U.N. and ending subsidies for some agricultural products, like dairy and sugar. Its projected savings: $377 billion in the first year, or about 19% of the $2 trillion that Musk is eyeballing.",
      "But efficiency goes beyond cost-cutting, Kamarck noted. It's also about understanding how the bureaucracy works.",
      "\"Every single thing in the federal government is big and complicated, and there are layers and layers of complexity,\" she noted. \"Al Gore and I relied on hundreds of experienced civil servants to tell us how this worked \u2014 and if you don't do this, which I suspect they won't because Musk is an arrogant billionaire, you will fail.\"",
      "Does Musk have conflicts of interest?",
      "Yes, as Musk's SpaceX works with the Department of Defense and NASA, with the federal government pledging $3 billion to his companies last year, according to the New York Times. Tesla, meanwhile, has been investigated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, as well as by other agencies.",
      "Federal employees are generally required to disclose their financial assets and entanglements to ward off any potential conflicts of interest, and to divest significant holdings relating to their work. Because Musk and Ramaswamy would not be formal federal workers, they would not face those requirements or ethical limitations.",
      "Then there's also the question of Musk's ability to juggle another major role, given that he is also running several businesses, from Tesla to SpaceX, Columbia Business School's Morris noted.",
      "\"The whole question of Elon coming into government, that he's going to be this sort of roving efficiency expert, like a McKinsey consultant looking over the shoulders of the entire government \u2014 it's absurd on so many levels,\" Morris said. \"He's already the CEO of companies that are very demanding of his time.\"",
      "He added, \"To do work in government of this sort, you have to be process-oriented in a way that he has never been before.\"",

      "Sealed bids were opened Wednesday at the auction, which had been\u00a0approved by a bankruptcy court earlier this year to allow the Sandy Hook families to receive payments from Jones. The conspiracy theorist and his company filed for bankruptcy in 2022 after losing defamation and emotional distress lawsuits by Sandy Hook families after he repeatedly called the Connecticut school shooting a hoax staged by \"crisis actors.\"",
      "The purchase was confirmed by conspiracy theorist Jones, who posted a video on X saying that The Onion bought his company. \"The Connecticut Democrats with the Onion newspaper bought us,\" he said in the post, describing the bidding as \"competitive.\"",
      "The statement from the Sandy Hook families said the purchase includes Infowars' intellectual property, which includes its website, customer lists and inventory, as well as some social media accounts and production equipment used by Jones to air his shows.",
      "\"The Connecticut families agreed to forgo a portion of their recovery to increase the overall value of The Onion's bid, enabling its success,\" according to the statement.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Postal Service on Thursday\u00a0said its annual loss widened to almost $10 billion, although revenue rose slightly after two postage rate hikes this year, part of Postmaster Louis DeJoy's plan to get the postal agency on a better financial footing.",
      "The USPS said it lost $9.5 billion in the fiscal year ended September 30, compared with a loss of $6.5 billion a year earlier. The postal service blamed the wider loss on billions spent on noncash contributions to worker compensation.",
      "Excluding that expense as well as what it described as other \"certain expenses that are not controllable by management,\" the USPS said it would have lost $1.8 billion in fiscal 2024, compared with a loss of more than $2.2 billion a year earlier. Revenue rose 1.7% to $79.5 billion in the most recent fiscal year.",
      "The USPS is in the midst of a 10-year overhaul engineered by DeJoy, who has argued that higher postal rates and other changes are essential to staunch the postal service's financial bleeding. Under his original plan, the USPS had aimed to turn a profit in fiscal 2024, but instead, the agency has now reported mounting losses for two consecutive years, raising questions about the effectiveness of the turnaround effort.",
      "DeJoy said the agency is focused on reducing its costs, but that it is also dealing with \"many economic, legislative and regulatory obstacles for us to overcome.\"",
      "The USPS has raised postage rates twice in 2024, with a two-cent per stamp increase in January and a second boost in July, which raised the cost of a Forever stamp to 73 cents.",
      "Fewer deliveries",
      "Mail volume declined in the most recent fiscal year, although revenue increased due to the higher postage rates, the USPS said. It delivered 112 billion pieces of mail, magazines, packages and other items last year, a decline of 3.2% from the prior fiscal year, it said in a financial report.",
      "Keep US Posted, an advocacy group of newspapers, magazines and other companies that rely on the USPS, described the agency's $9.5 billion loss as \"staggering,\" and said it was $3 billion higher than expected. The group also blamed the rate hikes for driving customers away from the USPS, reducing mail volume.",
      "\"The bottom line is that these consistent financial losses are driven by stamp hikes which lead to disastrous mail volume losses, plus the complete failure of USPS to capture parcel market share in already crowded package delivery space,\" said Keep US Posted executive director Kevin Yoder in a statement.",
      "Yoder, a former Republican Congressman from Kansas, also criticized the USPS for focusing on packages rather than traditional mail delivery, which he said remains the largest revenue generator for the postal service.",

    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 15:45:31 -0500",
    "summary": "One couple took out a loan to cover the out-of-network costs of an abortion and drove eight hours to a hospital in the neighboring state.",
    "story": [
      "Four women suing over Idaho's strict abortion ban told a judge Tuesday how excitement over their pregnancies turned to grief and fear after they learned their fetuses were not likely to survive to birth \u2014 and how they had to leave the state to get abortions amid fears that pregnancy complications would put their own health in danger.",
      "\"We felt like we were being made refugees, medical refugees,\" said Jennifer Adkins, one of the plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The women, represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights, aren't asking for the state's abortion ban to be overturned. Instead, they want the judge to clarify and expand the exceptions to the strict ban so that people facing serious pregnancy complications can receive abortions before they are at death's door.",
      "Currently, the state's near-total ban makes performing an abortion a felony at any stage of pregnancy unless it is \"necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant woman.\"",
      "Adkins' fetus had a severe medical condition that meant the fetus would not survive the pregnancy. The illness also put Adkins at risk of developing \"mirror syndrome,\" a dangerous syndrome that can cause fatally high blood pressure and other issues, she said.",
      "Adkins and her husband, John, decided to seek an abortion, and learned, after another ultrasound showed the fetus still had a heartbeat, that they would have to go out of state to get one.",
      "Idaho law prohibits a woman from getting an abortion when a fetal heartbeat is detected, with the exception of cases of rape, incest or a \"medical emergency,\" defined by the law as \"a condition that, in reasonable medical judgment, so complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"",
      "\"No parent wants to wish that when they look at an ultrasound they don't see their baby's heartbeat, yet here I was hoping that I wouldn't,\" Adkins said. \"I wanted the decision to be made for us, and I wanted to end her suffering, so it was really hard to see that and know that we had the challenges ahead of us that we did.\"",
      "\"I was not willing to watch my son suffer\"",
      "Kayla Smith cried as she told the judge how she found out she was pregnant for a second time on Mother's Day of 2022, and how she and her husband chose the name \"Brooks\" for their son. She was around 18 or 20 weeks along in her pregnancy when the sonographer grew quiet during a routine anatomy scan, Smith said.",
      "Brooks' heart had fatal anomalies, and the young family could not find a pediatric cardiologist willing to attempt an operation. The veins supplying Brooks' lungs were also abnormal, Smith said, and he would not survive birth.",
      "Smith had developed dangerously high blood pressure during a previous pregnancy, and she was at risk of developing the condition called preeclampsia again.",
      "\"If I were to continue pregnancy not only would I risk my life with preeclampsia, I was not willing to watch my son suffer and potentially gasp for air,\" Smith said, crying.",
      "Idaho's abortion ban went into effect two days before Brooks' diagnosis, she said, making it impossible for her to get an abortion in her home state.",
      "\"We wanted to meet our son \u2014 that was really important to us \u2014 so we needed to do it in a hospital,\" she said.",
      "They took out a loan to cover the estimated $16,000 to $20,000 out-of-network cost for the procedure and drove more than eight hours to a hospital where doctors induced labor.",
      "\"All four of these women were overjoyed to be pregnant with their second child and all four of them received the worst news a mother can imagine,\" attorney Gail Deady, with the Center for Reproductive Rights, told 4th District Judge Jason D. Scott during opening arguments. All of them sought abortions \"to protect their health, to spare their babies from pain and suffering, and to remain alive and healthy to protect their young children.\"",
      "James Craig, a division chief with the Idaho Attorney General's office, said the women and their attorneys are relying on hypotheticals rather than concrete facts to make their case. Under their proposal, a pregnant woman could receive her abortion for something as minor as stepping on a rusty nail \u2014 even though the risk of infection in that scenario could be easily treated by receiving a tetanus booster shot, Craig said.",
      "\"Unborn children have a fundamental right to life, and protecting the lives of children is a legitimate and fundamental government interest,\" Craig said.",
      "The state also has the same interest in protecting the lives of women, Craig said \u2014 and the abortion ban laws do both, he contended.",
      "In the \"rare circumstances where abortion is necessary\" to prevent the death of the mother, Idaho law allows that to occur, Craig said. The women suing are trying to \"usurp the role of the Legislature\" by asking the judge to rewrite the law, he said, and that is not the proper role of the court.",
      "Dr. Emily Corrigan, an ob-gyn who works in emergency medicine at Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center who is also a plaintiff in the case, told the judge how Idaho's multiple abortion bans have created confusion for physicians and made it difficult to treat pregnant patients who need emergency care.",
      "Doctors have had to \"basically guess which pregnancy conditions would fall under the state medical exception,\" Corrigan said.",
      "\"I have had other hospital staff refuse to participate in the care of my patients because of the lack of understanding of the laws, and this has caused patient care delays,\" she said. \"I have personally cared for several patients who have been denied stabilizing abortion care at other hospitals in Idaho. By the time they arrive at my institution, their conditions have deteriorated and have lead to increased complications that I need to manage.\"",
      "Several conditions can put the health of pregnant people at risk, she said. Some are caused by pregnancy like preeclampsia, and others \u2014 including some chronic illnesses and cancers \u2014 can be made worse by pregnancy, she said. In those cases, delaying an abortion might not cause immediate death but can cause a shortened life span or have dramatic effects on a person's health, Corrigan said.",
      "\"We are not trained to wait until things become urgent or emergent. We are trained to prevent harm to our patients,\" she said.",

      "That scandal involved a hard-up noblewoman named Jeanne de la Motte who pretended to be a confidante of the queen, and managed to acquire a lavish diamond-studded necklace in her name, against a promise of a later payment.",

    "title": "Can Trump impose tariffs without Congress? It's complicated, experts say.",
    "published": "Thu, 14 Nov 2024 07:28:00 -0500",
    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump claims he can unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports. The reality is more complicated, according to trade experts.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who recently described \"tariff\" as\u00a0\"the most beautiful word in the dictionary,\" has proposed a range of taxes on imports from other countries. The president-elect's stated aim: to reduce American companies' use of foreign goods and parts by raising their cost, a policy he contends would strengthen the U.S.' international trade position and boost job growth at home.",
      "Trump has also claimed that he doesn't need Congress' support to impose sweeping tariffs. The reality is more complicated, according to economists and foreign trade experts.",
      "What has Trump proposed?",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump proposed tariffs of up to 60% on Chinese goods. He's offered few additional details, however, such as whether the tariffs would apply to all goods or just certain categories of products.",
      "He's also proposed much broader tariffs of 10% to 20% on all imports, including those from key allies and trade partners, and has promised retaliatory levies on any country that imposes taxes on American-made goods.",
      "Can Trump unilaterally impose tariffs?",
      "Once he takes office, President-elect Trump has several possible pathways for implementing tariffs.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the authority to impose tariffs in Article 1, Section 8, which states that \"The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties\u2026To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\" But Congress can also selectively delegate tariff-setting authority to the president, which it has done for decades.",
      "In his first term as president from 2017-2021, Trump freely exercised this presidential authority to increase tariffs: Total duties paid on U.S. imports doubled from roughly $37 billion in 2015 to $74 billion in 2020, according to the\u00a0Congressional Research Service.",
      "\"Looking at his previous four years in office, he seems to believe he has the authority to impose tariffs,\" said Jake Colvin, president of the National Foreign Trade Council, a group dedicated to advocating for U.S. companies in international commerce. \"If they decide on day one that they want to use executive authority to put tariffs on Chinese goods, they could probably go ahead and do that.\"",
      "Colvin added that it will be important for the incoming Trump administration to provide businesses with more specifics so that companies can plan accordingly. \"A lot has been proposed in the course of the campaign, so it's important for the administration to give a signal about the path it intends to pursue, for clarity and planning purposes for American businesses,\" he said.",
      "How fast is Trump likely to move?",
      "The president has authority to impose a range of trade restrictions on foreign nations, said Inu Manak, a trade policy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\"It seems pretty clear that he would pursue tariffs soon after taking office. During his last term, tariffs were a tool of choice in the trade war against China and against allies, too. So I believe that is a strategy he'll replicate in his next term,\" Manak told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Manak added that he would likely be able to do so without support from Congress. \"The president has quite a bit of discretion to do what he wants,\" she said.",
      "Legal powers at Trump's disposal include Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the president may impose retaliatory tariffs when \"an act policy, or practice of a foreign country \u2026 violates, or is inconsistent with, the provisions of, or otherwise denies benefits to the United States under, any trade agreement, or \u2026 is unjustifiable and burdens or restricts United States commerce.\"",
      "Trump previously\u00a0invoked\u00a0Section 301 to impose tariffs on China in 2018 and 2019 \u2014 many of which have been continued under the Biden administration \u2014 and he could simply expand upon existing tariff actions he's already taken, according to Manak.",
      "\"That would require no action from Congress because they are already in place,\" she said.",
      "What other power Trump does have?",
      "In his previous term as president, he also made use of\u00a0Section 232\u00a0of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. It grants the president the authority to adjust imports, including by imposing tariffs, when they are deemed a threat to national security.",
      "There's also the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), although it hasn't used to restrict trade since President Richard Nixon was in office. The act says: \"Any authority granted to the President by ... this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat ... to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"",
      "\"The authorities granted to the President ... may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency ...\" it adds in part.",
      "In other words, in order to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, Trump would have to declare a national emergency through an executive order, claiming that a U.S. trading partner posed a major threat.",
      "Alan Wm. Wolff, former deputy director-general of the World Trade Organization and a distinguished visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE), is skeptical that Trump has the authority to impose sweeping tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "\"Can it be used against trade with all countries, our allies and friends in Europe and Asia, in the Americas, not to mention the poorest countries in Africa? That would simply be too large a power grab to have been within what Congress intended in this statute,\" he wrote in a recent blog post.",
      "Manak also said Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 could conceivably give the president the authority to unilaterally raise tariffs. The rarely used act allows the president to impose duties of up to 50% of a product's value, and is triggered when a president finds that a foreign country has imposed an unreasonable charge on, or discriminated against, U.S. commerce.",
      "Typically, though, that has to be determine by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC). \"But the statute's language is ambiguous in terms of what that would look like, and I would imagine he could pursue this without a final finding from ITC, or pursue it while a finding is being made,\" Manak said.",
      "How would sweeping tariffs affect U.S. consumers?",
      "Some companies have already said they're aiming to move production out of China to avoid Trump's proposed tariffs. Shoemaker Steve Madden, for example, said last week week it plans to import fewer goods made in China and replace them with items made in other countries.",
      "If imposed, the proposed tariffs on imports could lead to consumers losing between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, according to the National Retail Federation.",
      "By another estimate, a 20% general tariff on all imported goods, combined with a 60% tariff on goods imported from China, would cost the typical U.S. households more than $2,600 a year. If Trump instead imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff, that would cost families $1,700 more, according to PIIE.",
      "Experts expect the incoming Trump administration to impose some proposed tariffs quickly, while perhaps phasing in or threatening to apply other levies over time in a bid to gain trade concessions.",
      "\"We would imagine that within a few months of him taking office, we would see the first tranche of tariffs taking effect,\" Manak said.",

An 88-year-old man who resided in Grand Junction, Colorado, died, as previously reported. The illnesses began at the end of September, and the most recent onset of illness occurred as of October 21, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",

      "23andMe, the struggling ancestry tracing company, continues to spiral, raising questions about its business prospects and what could happen to its sensitive customer genetic testing data.",
      "23andMe on Tuesday announced it is slashing 40% of its workforce as part of a restructuring plan. The move comes after its entire board resigned in September. Its stock price has since plunged, prompting speculation that the company could be acquired by another buyer and sparking concern among customers about the security of their genetic information.",
      "CEO Anne Wojcicki has said she intends to take the company private and is not considering third-party takeover proposals.",
      "Customer data collected from its genetic testing tools makes up the company's most valuable asset. Because 23andMe is not a health care company, health privacy laws don't apply, raising questions about what the business might opt to do with its 15 million users' personal genetic data.",
      "Under 23andMe's current user agreement, users must opt-in to allow the company to share their personal DNA or data. The agreement states that if the company is acquired, customers' data may be accessed or sold as part of such a transaction.",
      "23andMe told CBS MoneyWatch correspondent Kelly O'Grady that while there are no plans for a sale, the current privacy agreement would apply.",
      "Meanwhile, at least 11 states have passed privacy laws that would require customers' consent before their genetic data is transferred.",
      "Still, experts say a new owner could change 23andMe's privacy terms following a sale, potentially putting the onus on consumers to push back against any move to share their data.",
      "23andMe said that roughly 80% of its customers consent to participate in the company's research program, which it said has generated more than 270 peer-reviewed publications uncovering new genetic insights into disease. Any data that shared is anonymized and cannot be traced back to individual customers, according to the company.",
      "Still, users can can take additional steps to protect their data, including deleting their 23andMe accounts \u2014 a process that is automated and straightforward.",
      "\"If, at any time, you are no longer interested in participating in our Services, you may delete your 23andMe account directly within your Account Settings,\" the company states on its website.",

      "Two women interviewed by the House Ethics Committee about former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be attorney general, testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly in Venmo transactions \"for sex,\" and that those transactions were obtained by the committee, an attorney for the women told CBS News. The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women testified that Gaetz inquired in text messages about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties, which was understood to be code for drugs.",
      "Leppard, who is based in Orlando, said his clients testified that they attended parties from 2017 to January 2019 where Gaetz was present and sex and drug use took place. In an interview Monday with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, Leppard said one of his clients testified before the House Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl against a game table at a July 2017 party. Gaetz was sworn into Congress in January 2017, so all of the events the women allege took place while he was a member of the House.",
      "Officials with the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment Monday. One source familiar with Gaetz's legal position questioned the credibility of the women and argued their recollections would not have withstood cross examination in court, had it come to that.",
      "Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing, including having sex with a minor, has blasted the committee's investigation against him and on Thursday called the testimony about him a \"false smear.\"",

      "One of his clients said in a text to Leppard, \"'Regardless of how many times he tries to distract from the truth, the public deserves to know that what we all experienced was real and actually happened.'\"",
      "\"My clients are not political; they didn't vote in the last two elections \u2014 they don't care one way or another,\" Leppard told Garrett. \"But they do want the public to know that they are not lying. They did not come forward willingly \u2014 they have never spoken to anyone without a force of a legal subpoena.\"",
      "He continued, \"And if the American people would know, then they could decide if that's the person they want to be the next attorney general.\"",
      "One of Leppard's clients is among at least four women who have told the committee they were paid to attend parties with drugs and sex where Gaetz was present, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Her account corroborates the testimony of the then-minor, who told the committee that she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 years old.",
      "At the July 2017 party where his client alleges this occurred, Leppard said she and others were \"at the party in order to provide entertainment, to be happy, to be lively and provide sexual favors for the gentlemen that were present.\"",
      "\"The expectation was that they would have sexual intercourse,\" Leppard said his clients testified about these parties. \"They testified to the House that \u2014 and the House actually had their Venmo transactions, PayPal transactions, of Representative Gaetz.\"",
      "Leppard said the House panel asked the women about Gaetz's PayPal and Venmo transactions.",
      "\"'What was this for? What was this for,'\" Leppard said his clients were asked.",
      "\"'This was for sex,'\" he said they responded. \"'This was for sex. This was for sex.'\"",
      "Leppard said the payments were typically between $200 and $500 at a time.",
      "He said his clients also testified that sometimes, someone other than Gaetz would make a payment on his behalf. On at least one occasion, according to Leppard, that was Nestor Galban, a Cuban immigrant who is close to Gaetz and whom Gaetz has referred to as his \"son.\" He said other payments on Gaetz's behalf were made by Gaetz associate Joel Greenberg, who was convicted in 2022 of sex trafficking of a minor and other crimes.",
      "Leppard said his client who testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with the 17-year-old also told the panel she did not believe Gaetz was aware of her age at the time.",
      "\"My client, at least, testified that he did not know her age,\" Leppard said.",

      "His client testified that she had sex with Gaetz after arriving at the July 2017 house party. Later during the party, his client testified, she was walking outside when she saw Gaetz having sex with her friend, the 17-year-old, against the gaming table.",
      "Leppard said one of his clients provided more than 100 texts involving Gaetz to the committee. Frequently, Leppard said, the texts his client provided showed Gaetz would have to be reminded to pay.",
      "\"There was a lot of texts requesting payment, like, 'Hey, when are you going to pay me?'\" Leppard said. \"Or, 'I don't want to be that girl, but can you please go ahead and pay me what we agreed upon?' Text messages along those lines. The texts the House was more interested in was the ones where Representative Gaetz was seemingly requesting that drugs be present.\"",
      "\"So, in my line of work as a criminal defense attorney, no one ever requests, 'Can you give me some drugs, please?'\" Leppard said. \"They usually use code words. And so Representative Gaetz would use terms like, 'Can you make sure that there are party favors present?' Or, 'Who's in charge of party favors?' He used the term 'party favor mecca' when he was referring to another individual who was bringing party favors. He also used the term 'vitamins,' I believe.\"",
      "Still, Leppard's clients told the House panel they could not specifically recall whether they had seen Gaetz use marijuana or other drugs.",
      "The texts also included a \"lot of positive emojis,\" Leppard said, like hearts, and \"positive statements\" back and forth between Gaetz, his clients and others. Leppard characterized the relationship with Gaetz as a complicated one, but also one of friendship, and he also told Garrett that his clients knew Gaetz's girlfriend at the time.",
      "\"At least one of my clients testified that, in a sense, they were required to please Mr. Gaetz before going out and attending their [Electronic Dance Music] show,\" Leppard said of one alleged occasion about which his client testified. \"And that was something that was of particular interest to the House. Representative Gaetz's girlfriend texted them, and they essentially took care of their duties, and later on, they went to see their show.\"",
      "Leppard said his clients have \"been through heck\" and are worried that if they testify before the Senate or anywhere else publicly, \"they might not be safe in their jobs.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee had planned to vote Friday, Nov. 15, on releasing its report, but the meeting was canceled after Trump announced his intention Wednesday to nominate Gaetz, and then a few hours later, the Florida Republican abruptly resigned from Congress. The panel is now set to meet Wednesday, two sources told CBS News.",

      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s concerns about the health effects of fluoride may already be helping some Americans \u2014 investors in dental services companies.",
      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",
      "\"The thought here is RFK will bring to HHS a voice that is in favor of reducing, or eliminating, the amount of fluoridation that is added to drinking water,\" Don Bilson, Gordon Haskett's head of event-driven research, told investors in a report, according to\u00a0NBC News. \"This will, in turn, lead to an acceleration of tooth decay and more dental visits.\"",
      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",

    "summary": "Trump has indicated that the revelations about the accuser and payment have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to serve as defense secretary, paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault out of concern that the allegation would lead to his firing from the cable news giant, his lawyer told CBS News.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, said the Army veteran reached a confidential settlement agreement to deter his accuser from going forward with a lawsuit, maintaining that he is innocent and the sexual encounter was consensual. Hegseth denies any wrongdoing.",
      "\"The reality is that, had they filed [a lawsuit], civil process takes quite a while, and so Fox News likely would have fired him based on the allegation,\" said Parlatore, adding that the woman and her attorney \"knew that simply filing it would cause an immediate horror storm for [Hegseth].\"",
      "Fox News Media said in a statement Monday it \"was not made aware of the incident or the settlement.\"",
      "Trump's transition team spoke with Parlatore after Hegseth was named as Trump's nominee defense secretary, the attorney said. He said that he \"explained this fully\" to them but that he did not know what prior conversations Hegseth had with the transition team, or if they had been informed about the sexual assault allegation and settlement agreement before the announcement of his impending nomination for defense secretary.",
      "\"This should have nothing to do with the confirmation process,\" he said.",
      "Trump has indicated that these revelations have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary. After reports surfaced of the sexual assault accusation, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said, \"President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.\"",
      "The alleged sexual assault took place after midnight on Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa. The woman, whose identity has been kept confidential, filed a complaint with the Monterey Police Department four days later alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth. The city of Monterey confirmed the 2017 investigation into Hegseth and said in a statement that investigators found the woman had \"contusions\" on her right thigh. No charges were filed, Parlatore said.",
      "The Washington Post, which first reported the financial payment, obtained what it referred to as a memo that was sent to the Trump transition team by a friend of the accuser alleging Hegseth raped a conservative group staffer in his room after drinking at the hotel bar. According to the Post, the memo states that the day after the incident, the accuser \"had a moment of hazy memory of being raped the night before, and had a panic attack.\"",
      "CBS News has not seen the memo and cannot verify its contents.",
      "Parlatore told CBS News that there is eyewitness testimony and video surveillance footage that allegedly shows the accuser was the \"aggressor\" in a consensual sexual encounter. \"[Hegseth] was intoxicated. She was sober. She was the one grabbing him by the arm and leading him out of the bar to take him upstairs,\" he said.",
      "When asked if CBS News could view the footage, Parlatore said, \"No.\" He also declined to share the names of any eyewitnesses.",
      "CNN reported that it spoke with the alleged victim last week, who \"became visibly distraught at the mention of Hegseth's name.\" CNN says she declined to be interviewed at the time and then stopped responding.",
      "Parlatore would not share the exact timing of the settlement payment to the woman. He said it occurred \"a couple years ago,\" emphasizing that it was \"well before Trump was even nominated [for the presidency], let alone had named Pete to this position.\"",
      "He also declined to disclose the amount of the settlement, only saying it was \"far, far less than what she wanted.\" He characterized it as \"essentially an extortion and blackmail.\"",
      "Two years after the alleged incident, Parlatore said that Hegseth was informed the woman was making what they called \"false claims\" against him and was threatening to sue him. Parlatore said that she had lost her job and claimed she needed money. In February of 2020, he sent her a cease-and-desist letter. She went \"quiet for a year\" before he learned she had found an attorney for her case.",
      "Trump's selection of Hegseth has been plagued with controversy. The announcement that the Fox News personality was his choice for secretary of Defense took many in Washington by surprise. \"Wow,\" responded Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski upon learning he had been picked to lead the Defense Department. \"I just said, wow,\" she repeated when asked for her thoughts.",
      "Even Hegseth's\u00a0tattoos have attracted scrutiny, specifically the \"Deux Vult\" tattoo on his inner bicep. The symbolism of that tattoo, which has been tied to extremist groups and the Christian Crusaders, alarmed a member of Hegseth's National Guard unit, who warned superiors that Hegseth was a potential \"insider threat\" before President Joe Biden's inauguration. He was removed from guarding the inauguration.",
      "After The Associated Press reported Hegseth had been flagged as a threat, Vice President-elect JD Vance defended him on social media, accusing the outlet of \"attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm.\"\u00a0Hegseth then shared Vance's tweet, commenting, \"They can target me \u2014 I don't give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD.\"",
      "The news of Hegseth's financial settlement agreement with a confidentiality clause may ring familiar to Trump. The president-elect's own troubles related to a nondisclosure agreement with adult film star Stormy Daniels led to the New York trial in which he became a convicted felon, as well as the first former (and now future) president to be criminally prosecuted.",
      "Trump was found\u00a0guilty on 34 counts\u00a0of falsifying business records related to an alleged cover-up of the payment to Daniels. He has argued that the verdict should be overturned and the indictment dismissed on the basis, among other things, of the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Wednesday as it faces increasing pressure to release a potentially damaging report detailing its investigation into allegations former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, two sources told CBS News.",
      "The movements of the Ethics panel have been under heightened scrutiny since President-elect Donald Trump announced last week that he had selected Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The Florida Republican resigned his seat in the House in the wake of the announcement, which ended the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over Gaetz since he is now a former member.",
      "The Ethics Committee declined to comment on the upcoming meeting. The panel was supposed to meet Friday to vote on releasing the report, but Trump tapped Gaetz for the nation's top law enforcement officer days earlier. The committee then postponed its meeting.",
      "Gaetz must win Senate confirmation to serve as attorney general, and senators have been calling to see the Ethics Committee's report as they weigh whether to approve his nomination. Any confirmation hearings, which would be conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would not take place until next year after Trump is inaugurated. Republicans will gain control of the upper chamber in the next Congress, which begins Jan. 3.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters last week that he believes senators should have access to the Ethics Committee's findings.",
      "\"I think there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,\" said Cornyn, who sits on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a Trump ally, similarly told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he believes the Senate should be able to see the report on Gaetz.",
      "\"Congress has to advise and consent, and Matt Gaetz is going to go through the same scrutiny as every other individual, and I'm going to give him a fair shot, just like every individual, and at the end of the day, the Senate has to confirm him,\" he said.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned against the release of the report by the Ethics Committee, warning in an interview Sunday that doing so for someone who is not a current House member \"would be a Pandora's box.\"",
      "\"What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,\" Johnson told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to non-members of Congress.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee first began its investigation into allegations of misconduct against Gaetz in April 2021, but deferred its consideration in response to a request from the Justice Department. It resumed its investigation in May 2023 after federal investigators declined to charge Gaetz following their sex-trafficking and obstruction probe.",
      "Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing and blamed the ethics probe on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He has called the investigation a \"smear.\" The Florida congressman helped lead the historic effort to strip McCarthy\u00a0of the speaker's gavel last year.",
      "The ethics panel said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation into Gaetz, and determined that \"certain allegations merit continued review.\"",
      "The committee said it was examining accusations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave \"special privileges and favors\" to people close to him and sought to obstruct government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women told the Ethics Committee that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. The panel has the Florida Republican's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women. One woman who testified to the Ethics Committee said she had sex with Gaetz at a party in 2017, just after he was elected to Congress and when she was 17 years old, sources told CBS News at the time",
      "Her lawyer, John Clune, said on social media last week that she was a high school student and \"there were witnesses.\"",

    "summary": "Kennedy insists he is not \"anti-vaccine,\" but he has a long record of false and misleading statements\u200b about their safety and benefits. What could he do as Trump's HHS secretary?",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could wield significant authority to directly affect how and whether Americans get vaccines\u00a0nationwide, current and former federal health officials say, if he is confirmed next year to head the Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The position would grant Kennedy authority over efforts like the Vaccines for Children program, which is estimated to have saved 1.1 million lives by immunizing children against diseases like polio and measles that are now rare thanks to the shots.",
      "Many public health experts have decried the pick, saying Kennedy's past claims about vaccines are disqualifying.",
      "\"A serious candidate for this position would follow the decades of real-world evidence that shows that vaccines are safe and prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year,\" Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said Monday in a statement.",
      "Is RFK Jr. anti-vaccine?",
      "Kennedy has insisted he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and promised not to try to ban the shots under the Trump administration \u2014 but he has a long record of making misleading statements about vaccines and fanning doubts about their proven benefits and safety.",
      "He wrote a now-retracted article in 2005 falsely claiming autism was linked to a discontinued ingredient in vaccines, and continues to say he thinks vaccines are a cause of autism, which decades of scientific research has thoroughly discredited.",
      "On social media, Kennedy called COVID shots \"a crime against humanity\" and claimed children did not need COVID vaccines. (Research\u00a0estimates\u00a0that COVID vaccines prevented 3.2 million deaths in the U.S. through 2022.)",
      "The group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, has been denounced by experts for being among the most prolific spreaders of misinformation about vaccines.",
      "In recent months, Kennedy has\u00a0said his goal is to \"provide Americans with transparency and access to all the data so they can make informed choices.\" He also wants to clean house at federal health agencies, ousting \"corrupt\" officials he claims have clouded \"their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\"",
      "The head of the FDA's vaccines program says he hopes Kennedy will \"keep an open mind\" about what the science shows.",
      "\"Perhaps engaging in that dialogue, especially if it's in a public venue, it may help. It may help bring some of the rest of the country along because sometimes as somebody is convinced, perhaps, maybe some of the rest of the country will be,\" Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said earlier this month.",
      "CDC recommendations and covering costs",
      "One of the biggest roles that the CDC plays in vaccinations is in deciding which vaccines health insurers are required to cover. Nearly all plans are required by law to cover routine shots that are recommended by the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "Updating that \"schedule\" of routinely recommended vaccines is usually a monthslong process for the committee, which is made up of medical experts who work to publicly analyze and vote on the benefits and risks of different shots.",
      "Those meetings happen at least three times every year, as the committee debates newly approved vaccines, annual updates to routine shots like influenza or COVID-19 and reevaluating the data on older immunizations.",
      "\"They incorporate epidemiology. Which groups are most affected? Are there certain subgroups that it is most effective for? Are there some groups that may not benefit very much from a certain vaccine,\" said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, the CDC's former associate director for adult immunizations.",
      "Bridges, who now works as a consultant on adult vaccinations, praised the \"very public discussion and often very rigorous debate\" among the experts selected to serve on the committee.",
      "The CDC's career civil servants are traditionally able to offer input into which experts are chosen for the panel, and federal law says the committee's membership should be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view.\"",
      "But, it will be Kennedy's decision alone to decide who sits on the committee. Kennedy's pick to head the CDC would also have the authority to override the panel's votes, as was done in 2021 to roll out some COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations have a wide impact beyond insurance coverage, Bridges said, influencing how doctors and local health departments talk about and offer the shots.",
      "Kennedy and his pick to head the CDC could also affect the agency's wide-ranging immunization work in other ways.",
      "For example, the agency is responsible for the Vaccines for Children program that supplies shots to pediatricians nationwide to ensure no-cost access for uninsured children. It also routinely steps in to sort out any confusion among providers over vaccine recommendations.",
      "The CDC also runs the main national data sources tracking immunization rates, vaccine effectiveness for some common shots and ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety.",
      "\"It's really the integration of all of those things. There's a lot that goes into this \u2014 the policy, the monitoring, the coordination, the communication,\" Bridges said.",
      "FDA approvals and regulations",
      "Kennedy and whoever he picks to lead the FDA would also play a big role in both the approval of vaccines and in regulating them after they are on the market.",
      "Decisions on whether to approve or reject applications from vaccine makers are traditionally left up to career scientists working in the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. That is mostly ensured only by norms, not law.",
      "\"It's totally within the law for the president or the HHS secretary to overrule the entire FDA. And so, that could happen. Did it happen to me? No. But I also want to say, I think the view that there's a sharp line between the political and scientific, we got to speak truthfully about this,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said Nov. 11, speaking at an event hosted by the Friends of Cancer Research.",
      "Califf said that \"99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products\" are made by civil servants with scientific expertise in the field. But the commissioner is sometimes forced to step in, like to resolve internal disagreements or appeals from outside the agency.",
      "Kennedy and his FDA commissioner could also influence vaccines in other ways, like through guidance the agency issues to manufacturers seeking approval.",
      "Policy changes recommended by the agency's staff can be stalled or rejected by political leaders. Major changes to FDA's rules are also funneled through the White House, which has the ability to block them.",
      "\"There's so many other aspects of this that are integrated in various ways with politics. And there's just no way around it,\" Califf said.",
      "Communicating risks and benefits",
      "Beyond Kennedy's direct authority over vaccines, another major way he and his picks to head the CDC and FDA could influence public opinion is through how they approach talking to Americans about the risks and benefits of vaccines.",
      "The department funds a number of efforts to survey public confidence in vaccines and study ways to improve it. They also run a number of campaigns to promote recommended shots, like advertising about the annual COVID-19 and flu vaccines or helping health departments respond to backsliding immunization rates in schools.",
      "\"We don't have to remember too far back to see what happens because of vaccination rates, when there aren't requirements and people don't have access,\" said Bridges, citing a polio case that emerged in New York in 2022.",
      "Outbreaks of polio once killed thousands of Americans and left many survivors paralyzed, until the disease was virtually eliminated in the U.S. by vaccines that first rolled out in the 1950s.",
      "The return of polio prompted an investigation by health authorities and a renewed push for vaccinations, though officials acknowledged they struggled to \"meaningfully increase\" immunization coverage.",
      "\"That's just mind-boggling that we can have a polio resurgence, in a country with all of our resources. It doesn't take all that much for diseases still circulating in other places to retake hold,\" said Bridges.",
      "Another way the communications role comes up is in navigating how to explain potential risks flagged by federal vaccine safety systems to doctors and the public.",
      "An example last year came after the FDA and CDC officials worked to craft a bulletin disclosing early concerns that COVID-19 shots might be increasing the risk of stroke for seniors, while also explaining why the preliminary \"safety signal\" did not warrant stopping use of the shots.",
      "Intense scrutiny of the issue by the U.S. and health authorities overseas eventually found \"no evidence of a safety concern,\" though health authorities continue to closely study the issue.",
      "The benefits of the vaccine continue to far outweigh this theoretical risk, the CDC's advisers concluded, especially among seniors who are at higher risk of severe illness or death from COVID.",
      "\"The current evidence does not support the existence of a safety issue. FDA and CDC will continue to evaluate data as they are available and update the public as needed,\" the FDA said.",

      "A judge Tuesday set Feb. 25 as the start of Bannon's trial on charges related to alleged money laundering, conspiracy and a scheme to defraud. The case stems from Bannon's alleged role in an organization that raised millions on the promise \u2014 during Trump's first term in office \u2014 that they would privately build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Bannon and the now-defunct group, called We Build the Wall, are accused of pocketing donations. He has entered a not guilty plea in the case and called the charges \"nonsense,\" accusing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of pursuing allegations out of political animus.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump tapped Republican Brendan Carr, an Elon Musk-backed critic of big tech, to lead the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), calling Carr a \"warrior for Free Speech\" in a statement on Sunday.",
      "Carr has \"fought against the regulatory Lawfare that has stifled Americans' Freedoms\" and will \"end the regulatory onslaught that has been crippling America's Job Creators and Innovators, and ensure that the FCC delivers for rural America,\" Trump said in the statement.",
      "Carr said on Musk's social platform X that he was \"humbled and honored\" to take on the role of FCC chairman.",
      "\"We must dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans,\" he wrote in another post Sunday.",
      "It is a phrase he has used repeatedly, posting on Friday: \"Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft & others have played central roles in the censorship cartel,\" adding that it \"must be dismantled.\"",

      "The five-person commission will have a 3-2 Democratic majority until next year, when Trump will get to appoint a new member, The Associated Press points out, adding that Carr has also been the commission's general counsel and was confirmed unanimously by the Senate three times and nominated by both Trump and President Biden to the commission.",

      "The New York Times reported that Starlink received an $885 million grant in late 2020 from the FCC -- but that the Democrat-led commission later revoked it because the service couldn't prove it would reach enough unconnected rural homes.",
      "Carr \"vociferously\" opposed the decision, the newspaper reported.",

      "Trump\u00a0sued CBS News, alleging the network's \"deceitful\" editing of the 60 Minutes interview of Harris misled the public and unfairly disadvantaged him. In a statement, CBS News called the former president's claims \"completely without merit\" and said the network intended to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.",

The president announced during the visit that the U.S. has reached its goal of increasing its climate finance to over $11 billion a year, up from $1.5 billion when Mr. Biden took office. He also designated Nov. 17 as International Conservation Day, while the administration announces new conservation efforts including $50 million for the Amazon Fund, among other initiatives.

      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet and senior staff picks are facing an uncertain future as his selections received mixed reviews in recent days even from fellow Republicans \u2014 and a handful sent shockwaves through Washington.",
      "Trump's selection for attorney general in former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a GOP firebrand who was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegations of sexual misconduct and obstruction, has drawn criticism from both sides of the aisle. And Trump's pick for defense secretary in Pete Hegseth, an Army combat veteran and former Fox News anchor, has also sparked concerns, especially as an investigation into sexual assault allegations against him has been made public. Additionally, former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, doesn't have a background in intelligence and has drawn criticism for her views on Russia and other U.S. adversaries.",
      "Appearing on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut expressed astonishment about those questioning whether experience is necessary when asked about Gabbard, saying \"of course it's necessary.\"",
      "\"These people are manifestly unqualified, and you know, they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they've been asked to run,\" Himes said.",
      "But Himes, the ranking Democrat on the the House Intelligence Committee, said that Gaetz's qualifications should also examined as well as the unreleased House Ethics Committee report.",
      "\"How is it that this is what we're focusing on?\" Himes said. \"Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the Attorney General, and yet we're sort of focused on this, you know, cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.\"",
      "Gaetz' resignation from Congress after Trump's announcement came days ahead of a planned meeting and vote by the House Ethics Committee on whether to release a report on its investigation into Gaetz. Speaker Mike Johnson said Friday that he would \"strongly request\" that committee withhold the potentially damaging report.",
      "Rep. French Hill, an Arkansas Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said Johnson makes \"an important point,\" warning that \"we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.\" But he stressed that the decision is the committee's alone, while noting that on Trump's selections, the Senate will exercise its advise and consent role through the confirmation process.",
      "\"President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government,\" Hill said.",
      "The Arkansas Republican outlined that when Trump came to office in 2017, there were members of his Cabinet who he had no personal relationship with or working background.",
      "\"He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with. He knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision making in his administration,\" Hill said.",
      "For his part, Himes offered some praise to some of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for Secretary of State, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser,\" Ratcliffe said. \"Those are good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience.\"",
      "Still, he cautioned Republicans in the Senate as the confirmation process plays out, saying that he understands \"what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump,\" but \"history is a harsh judge.\"",
      "\"The Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump,\" Himes said.",
      "Sue Gordon, who served as principal deputy director of national intelligence under Trump and also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, stressed that vetting will be critical to the process moving forward, amid a New York Times\u00a0report\u00a0that Trump's team may bypass the typical FBI procedure and instead opt to use a private firm to vet his nominees who would be granted security clearances.",
      "\"It seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution,\" Gordon said, noting that a private firm won't have the same standards. \"I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that assists with presidential transitions, confirmed to CBS News that the Trump team hasn't signed paperwork that allows for security clearances and background checks, among other things, to occur. Gordon said she can't think of a \"good reason\" for the Trump team to forego the transition paperwork, saying that \"one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are malfeasant.\"",
      "\"You're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers, and especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base,\" Gordon said. \"To start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.\"",

    "summary": "Dr. Deborah Birx\u200b, former White House Coronavirus response coordinator, said Sunday she is \"excited\" for the data on key health issues that will surface in Senate confirmation hearings for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Deborah Birx, former White House Coronavirus response coordinator, said Sunday she is \"excited\" for the data on key health issues that will surface in Senate confirmation hearings for Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's controversial pick for Health and Human secretary who has spread false information on vaccines and autism.",
      "\"I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data,\" Birx said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"What I know for sure is he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem.\"",
      "President-elect Donald Trump announced Thursday in a social media post that he'll nominate Kennedy to oversee the Health and Human Services Department, which encompasses multiple agencies and has a $1 trillion budget. The position has to be approved by the Senate, which, come January, will be controlled by Republicans, which could make the nomination process easier but is not a guarantee.",
      "\"I am thrilled to announce Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as The United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS),\" Trump wrote in a social media post last week. He said Americans have been \"crushed by the industrial food complex and drug companies who have engaged in deception, misinformation, and disinformation\" about public health, and Kennedy would \"Make America Great and Healthy Again!\"",
      "At an October rally, Trump\u00a0promised to let Kennedy \"go wild\" on health issues.",
      "Kennedy has criticized vaccines extensively in the past, including spreading misleading claims about their safety. He has also pledged to tackle an \"epidemic\" of chronic diseases and believes that large drug and food companies are to blame for a broad swath of ailments. Kennedy argues that a number of health issues in the U.S. have worsened, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, sleep disorders, infertility rates, diabetes and obesity, which he blames on federal inaction.",
      "Kennedy has insisted that he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and has pledged not to ban vaccines under the Trump administration. Kennedy instead promises to \"restore the transparency\" around vaccine safety data and records that he accuses HHS officials of hiding. This data is expected to be addressed in upcoming confirmation hearings in Congress, a dialogue that Birx said she believes Americans will benefit from learning more about the differing perspectives on concerns surrounding vaccines.",
      "\"So until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about,\" Birx said on Sunday.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the FDA's top vaccines official, said at an event hosted by the Milken Institute last week ahead of Trump's decision that he hopes to find common ground with Kennedy and that he is also open to a conversation based on data.",
      "\"What I would ask of him is that he keep an open mind. We're happy to try to show as much of the data as we can. And I think the data are essentially overwhelming, in certain areas, but we'll just have to engage in the dialogue,\" Marks said.",
      "If confirmed by the Senate, Kennedy will be in charge of a giant portfolio, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Birx said on Sunday that Kennedy, who ran for president this year but has never held public office and is already\u00a0facing criticism for his qualifications, would benefit from having an experienced team around him that come from the medical industry.",
      "\"So really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff, perhaps that has really come out of industry that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because \u2026\u00a0 HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments,\" Birx said.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, I think the Ethics Committee does make that decision for itself. But I think Speaker Johnson makes an important point, which is, Mr. Gaetz has resigned from Congress. There are many investigations that the House Ethics Committee has done, and we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee.",

Since taxpayers paid money for this report to be conducted, and it was done, do you think, if you were a Senate, you would consider this material information to confirming the top lawmaker for the United States of America \u2013 law enforcement officer, I should say?",

      "So, as I say, this is an important process that the Senate has to do advise and consent for all the nominations. And President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken to us before here on Face the Nation about your work around Syria and Bashar al-Assad's oppressive regime there. You actually visited Northern Syrian, an area that he wasn't in control of, back in 2017, the first lawmaker since John McCain to do so.",
      "Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, when she was in office, went to Syria and met with Mr. Assad himself. Then, publicly, she came out and questioned U.S. intelligence assessments of his chemical weapons attacks that were carried out on civilian areas, not just once, multiple times.",

He wants people that he has a good relationship with, that he trusts, that he believes can do a good job in the agencies to send the message that we want change in Washington.",
      "And the Senate too has their important job. And we're going to have to wait and see how the Senate handles each of these confirmations.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: No, I don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I'm simply saying, as a member of the committee, I don't question that public assessment that's been made in the public domain over many, many years.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: And I have led the charge against the Assad regime.",

And I think America has a lot to do to limit Assad's influence in the region, which is a partner with the Russians and the Iranians. And that's not in the interest of the United States, Iraq, Israel, or peace in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also been a supporter of Ukraine. And you have been trying to find some creative ways to help allow them to gain access to continued U.S. support.",
      "There was a tremendous attack just overnight there by Russia. The Biden administration wants to provide a $20 billion loan backed up by frozen Russian assets. Will the Congress give them permission to use that money for military assistance?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, the REPO Act that was included in the national security package I worked on very closely with Chairman Mike McCaul of the Foreign Affairs Committee gives the United States the authority to not only take frozen assets, but confiscate them and use them for the benefit of Ukraine.",
      "The loan you're referring to has been negotiated between the Europeans and the Americans to back the Ukrainian government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: I believe that will go through, in my judgment.",
      "But I would urge President Trump, as he takes office, to actually follow the law and confiscate those Russian assets, as I believe that gives both Ukraine, the United States, and Europe a much stronger negotiating position with Russia. And I don't believe Biden, nor the G7 countries have been tough enough on Russian on sanctions, on the delivery of weapons that were needed to have ended this war long ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're gesturing to what we know, which is that this is a pretty dangerous world right now.",
      "One of the selections that the president-elect has made to run the Pentagon at this time is Pete Hegseth. He would be the defense secretary, 44 years old, decorated Army vet, TV commentator. Do you think experience is necessary, or is on-the-job training OK at the Pentagon?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: Well, again, I think this will be assessed by the Senate in their confirmation process.",
      "He has a distinguished background in the military. And that counts for a lot. And I think his plans, his thoughts, his leadership will be exposed when he goes through that Senate confirmation process.",
      "But, once again, I have to say, President Trump, when he came into office in 2017, had Cabinet members that he really had no personal relationship with, had no working background with. He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with, he knows how they think, they know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision-making in his administration.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE FRENCH HILL: He's got that prerogative to nominate those men and women, and the Senate will have their advice-and-consent function well underway.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I feel like there is so much news, and I'm getting through a fraction of it, frankly, here.",
      "I want to pick up on Tulsi Gabbard, which we just \u2013 who we just discussed in the previous segment,. She was a Democratic colleague of yours for many, many years. You're the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. She never served on that kind of committee. Do you think experience is necessary? Is she fit for the job?",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Margaret, how far we have come that, on a major news show, the question we're examining is, is experience necessary for one of the most powerful positions in the land?",
      "Of course it's necessary. It's a little bit like our obsession right now with the Ethics Committee report on Matt Gaetz.",
      "(LAUGHTER)",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: How is it that this is what we're focusing on?",
      "Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the attorney general, and yet we're sort of focused on this cherry on the cupcake of the Ethics report.",
      "It sort of reminds me of Al Capone. In 1931, Al Capone is convicted of a couple of counts of tax evasion. Now, he was a killer and a rum runner and a mafioso, and yet he was convicted of tax evasion. This is what the conversation we're having about Matt Gaetz.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: You know, well, what about this Ethics report?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any suggestion from your Republican colleagues in the Senate that either of those two individuals will not be confirmed for those positions?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Look, all I would observe is that history is a harsh judge.",
      "And I understand what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump. Talk to Adam Kinzinger or Liz Cheney or many of the Republicans who voted for his impeachment who are now gone. I understand that.",
      "But history is a harsh \u2013 a hard judge. And a Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz, a chaos agent, a performative social media, no respect for the rule of law, individual, the Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: \u2026 will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "Well, the speaker of the House called him one of the greatest minds in the United States or anywhere on another program this morning.",
      "On intelligence, though, because of your committee oversight, John Ratcliffe, another former House member who went on to serve in an acting role at intelligence previously, he is the selection to run the CIA. Do you trust him to appropriately handle sensitive intelligence information?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: I do, Margaret.",
      "And just to be balanced here, since I was pretty strong in my opinions about the attorney general and the DNI nomination, I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for secretary of state, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA, and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security adviser.",
      "I would even add the nominee for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. Those were good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president, but these are serious people with real experience. They're not social media personalities. They haven't built their careers on lies and conspiracy.",
      "So, look, some of these nominations, I think, are quite solid, and John Ratcliffe falls in that category for me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "Last night, president-elect Trump was at a UFC rally, and alongside him was someone who has had a lot of scrutiny, Elon Musk. He is a billionaire with extensive U.S. government contracts, as I understand it, holds a security clearance himself. He has extensive business ties with China.",
      "He also had with him the Saudi Arabia private investment fund governor. They invest with his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and they have held golf tournaments through the \u2013 one of their entities at Trump golf courses.",
      "Do you think that, in this new Congress, there will be scrutiny of potential financial conflicts of interest around Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, of course there will be, right? This is sort of not subject to debate.",
      "We saw Trump's first term and the fact that that group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest. And, look, all \u2013 I don't know Elon Musk, odd character. You sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt space launch, to disrupt the auto industry and whatnot, but early reviews are not good.",
      "I read his 12-point government waste manifesto, and he said, look at all this money we're paying on interest on the debt. That's part of the wasteful spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

      "Look, I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. I know lots of wealthy people here, and there is a syndrome where very wealthy people who got wealthy in finance or as a tech entrepreneur decide that they're heart surgeons and capable of running the United States.",
      "I think that's what's going on with Elon Musk. But, again, early returns are not good with respect to his ability to understand the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient, which is a laudable goal. But I'm going to reserve judgment.",

      "Do you know and can you say if the hackers have actually been kicked out of U.S. infrastructure, or is China still embedded?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes, Margaret, that's not a question I can answer with an awful lot of specificity, but the fact that we obviously know about these hacks means that those particular hacks probably have been addressed in one way or another.",
      "But one thing I can say with great confidence, having worked in the intelligence world for some time now, is that I promise you they are out there in ways that we don't know about. So, my hope is that the president made it very clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerable and that he backs that up and, quite frankly, that Donald Trump, the next president, backs that up with action, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the big stick, right?",
      "We're pretty good at hacking networks too. And I think it's really important for the Chinese to understand that we're not just going to name and shame the hackers and complain about it, but we \u2013 but that we are going to go into their networks and give as good as we got. I suspect that, in this realm, they need to see that we are capable of inflicting a lot of damage if they continue their present behavior.",

      "There will be some selections, as we understand it, in the coming days in the financial space. You also sit on the Financial Services Committee. Trump backer Elon Musk yesterday blasted one of the hedge fund CEOs, Scott Bessent, a cryptocurrency skeptic who's being considered for that role.",
      "Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, apparently also being considered for that role, he is a cryptocurrency fan. Does either candidate stand out to you for a better pick? And what does it really project out to you about what's going to happen in this space for Mr. Trump?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, it's obviously up to the president to decide who he'd like as Treasury secretary.",
      "I would note that his first Treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, I certainly had disagree with \u2013 disagreements with him on any number of topics, including de-sanctioning the Russian aluminum company. But in the cast of characters in version 1.0 of the Trump administration, Steve Mnuchin was far from the creepiest and crawliest of them.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: So we will see what he does on Treasury.",
      "What I will say is that, look, crypto\u2026",

      "Good morning to you, Governor.",
      "You're a blue governor in a very red state. How do you even begin to try uniting a country as united \u2013 as divided as this? Are there lessons we can learn from Kentucky?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR (D-Kentucky): I think there's absolute lessons that we can learn from Kentucky,a state where last year I won as a Democrat by five points and Donald Trump just won by 30.",
      "And I think it basically boils down to both running and governing where people wake up in the morning and what they worry about when they go to bed at night. And that's not the next election. It's their job and whether they make enough to support their family.",
      "It's the next doctor's appointment for themselves, their parents or their kids. It's the roads and bridges they drive every day. It's that public school they drop their kids off at, and it's public safety in their community.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: The goal here is to focus on all of those things where, if people don't feel secure in those areas, they don't get to anything else. They don't get to the crazy thing that some politicians said last night or this morning. They don't get to that next piece of policy that's out there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-hmm.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: So it's a \u2013 it's about a relentless focus on people's everyday needs and their everyday life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "We're going to take a break, come back, and have the rest of the conversation on the other side of it. All of you, please stay with us.",

      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We return to our conversation with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear.",
      "Governor, Kentucky has a lot of coal. It's got natural gas. Mr. Trump has selected Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to be the next Energy secretary if confirmed. He's also selected Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to run the Interior Department, and he's promised to open up more federal lands to drilling.",
      "Do you have any idea what the impact would be on your state from the signals being sent with these selections?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we'll see. I mean, I saw the comments recently from the CEO of Exxon, which was a little different than what we might expect, talking about needing to move to greener forms of energy regardless of what the policy of the day is. And I certainly see from companies that are coming into Kentucky each and every day. We just announced a new industrial battery facility that's going to create 1,600 new jobs. They demand a certain portfolio of energy. Yes, the lights have to come on. But especially over time for their customers, they want a certain amount of renewables.",
      "So, what I've seen as governor is a private sector push that I do not think is going to change demands placed on states, demands placed on utilities, and the private sector ultimately moving us to a more diverse and cleaner portfolio.",
      "So here in Kentucky, yes, we have many traditional forms of energy, and they have really good jobs. And we want to make sure that we never look down on, and we support each of those jobs. But my goal is to diversify our production as much as we can so that we have the jobs of the present and those jobs of the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've said Kentucky has something like 10,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. You really made a big push on that that.",
      "During the campaign, Mr. Trump vowed to undo the electric vehicle mandate, that's what he called it, and he's going to, he says, repeal the law that includes credits for green projects.",
      "Do you know at this point if Republican leaders intend to keep parts of that? And are there projections on what repealing that law entirely would do to the job creation in your state?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, it's really concerning. You look at a state like Kentucky, that voted for President-elect Trump by 30 points. And it's 10,000 EV-related jobs on the line. And those are only growing.",
      "Go up to Ohio and look at that - I think $20 billion chips factory, which I'm a little bit jealous of, but happy for the people of Ohio, and what that would mean. Another state that voted for the president-elect.",
      "So, you look at all of these jobs, and jobs of the future, that have come to what the administration will probably view as red states. It's important that these projects continue.",
      "Remember, a lot of the people taking these jobs, jobs that support their families, voted for President-elect Trump because they thought that would improve their job, that he was focused on their job. So, I hope that he will get good advice, and I'll do everything I can to get my message out through our federal delegation of how important these jobs are.",
      "And they're not in urban Kentucky. They're in rural Kentucky. They are game-changing investments that have created a bright future here. And I'm certainly going to do everything I can as governor of Kentucky to protect them. And not because I'm a Democrat -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But because I've shown my people that every single day I'm going to try to create a better life for them. And that's what those jobs do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, $14 billion between now and 2030 was what was promised to your state.",
      "I wonder if you just think Democrats didn't do a good job of explaining that.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I certainly don't want to do any finger pointing because the vice president had 107 days, and she did her very best. And I proudly crisscrossed the country in support of her.",
      "But what I know is going forward, over the next couple years, we have a chance every day, every moment to show the American people that we are laser focused on jobs, on their health care, on their infrastructure -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: On their kids' education. Just - just those everyday worries. And with this administration at least right now selecting some very extreme appointees -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: It's a chance to make a real difference, to really show people that - that we are where their basic needs are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but there was, as you know, some analysis after the fact among Democrats about the focus on some culture war issues or - so to speak.",
      "Congressman Seth Moulton said of transgender issues, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\" He says he's speaking authentically and said Democrats should do more of it.",
      "Do you think Democrats have been out of touch on some of these things that obviously resonate in states like yours?",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I think that all candidates should stand up for their beliefs, and that we don't have to abandon those beliefs. You know, I vetoed one of the nastiest anti-LGBTQ bills that my state had ever seen in my election year.",
      "But I did two things. Number one, I talked about my wife (ph). For me that's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God. And I wanted to stick up for some children that were being picked on in a pretty rough bill.",
      "But the second thing is the voters in my state knew the very next day I was going to be working on jobs, I was going to be opening a new health clinic, first hospital in our largest African American neighborhood in 150 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: We just cut the ribbon on. And we've created two pediatric autism centers in Appalachia so that people don't have to drive two hours. So, it's both sharing your why and your authentic why for - for your views.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: But the other piece is about that focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: Because, remember, if we're talking about this issue of the day -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about what Donald Trump said last night -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR ANDY BESHEAR: And then we're talking about jobs, we're only spending a third of the time talking about what people are worried about and what impacts their life the most.",

      "Governor, thank you for joining us today.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Sue Gordon. She served as the principal deputy director of national intelligence during Donald Trump's first term in the White House.",
      "Good to see you here again.",
      "SUE GORDON (Former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence): Great to see you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you personally briefed Donald Trump as president in the Oval Office. If this nominee-to-be, Tulsi Gabbard, becomes the Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe becomes the CIA director, are you confident that Mr. Trump will be told the information he needs to know and not just what he wants to know?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, I think that's the - I think that's the question of the day. Intelligence is weird because it's always uncertain. And you are always making an assessment so that a decisionmaker can figure out what they're going to do with it. And so, it's particular. And you - your only job is to ruthlessly report what you see, not what you prefer. So that's the primary job of the DNI is to go in there and to be his principal adviser on intelligence. You're the first in. You're the last out.",
      "You cannot afford to I'll say pander to preference. Loyalty doesn't serve you well in that job. You have to be so committed that you will say inconvenient things. I will say the former president would tell you that I would talk to him about Russian interference. I know he hated it. But Russia was, in fact, interfering, and he needed to hear that information.",
      "So, do I believe that Tulsi and John can be that person if they believe they must be? They can learn. If they lean on the women and men of the intelligence community, they will produce an assessment. But that's a hard day, and you better be good at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had to undergo an FBI background check -",
      "SUE GORDON: I did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: To obtain a security clearance and to maintain it. You were a career official, 25 years at the CIA. Then, as we said, moved on to national intelligence.",
      "\"The New York Times\" is reporting the Trump team may bypass the FBI process and just use a private firm to vet candidate. Then when the president is sworn in, he can grant access to the nation's secrets, rather than go through that screening.",
      "What risk is there in bypassing the FBI?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, the first risk is that you will get an incomplete picture of the human that is carrying both the trust of the American people and the trust of our allies and partners and the trust of the women and men that are putting their lives on the line for that judgment, right? Everyone hates vetting. It's intrusive. It - you - you don't know why anyone should have to do it because you know who you are.",
      "But the truth is, we know adversaries and competitors will exploit humans to be able to advance their interests, and you want to make sure that the people that hold the American people's trust and the most precious pieces of information we have of advantage have no cracks in who they are. And so it seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution. And by that I mean the institutions of America, if you have people who we discover later that they should not have had access or we discover later that they were vulnerable to the actions of our allies and of our adversaries and competitors.",
      "And -",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's leverage on them?",
      "SUE GORDON: It is. I mean that's - I mean, the craft of human intelligence is actually finding someone who has a weakness and getting them to be able to advance your interests. And it just - and what a really good day is when you find someone whose interests align with yours, and then you really push that.",
      "So, a private firm isn't going to have the standards that we've had. I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, CBS has also learned that to date the Trump team hasn't signed the paperwork that would start the process of the national security briefings so that someone's not walking in cold. They're briefed and up to speed. Along with these background checks. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that helps with the transitions, confirmed that to CBS.",
      "Is there any good reason not to sign those papers? And what does it do for the officials who arrive without being read in on what's happening now?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I can't think of a - I can't think of a good reason. I think one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are maleficent. They need to be better. They need to be slimmer. They need to be more transparent, but they're not bums, so you're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers.",
      "And especially some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base, these are big jobs. I mean intelligence is not just advising the president, it's also running a huge enterprise in a manner that allows our allies and partners to trust us with their most precious thing. So, I can't think of a reason why that's not signed. And to start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation, just seems wrong-headed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diplomatically referring to Tulsi Gabbard there, who doesn't have a background in intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: She also has a history of statements of saying things that mirror the rhetoric of U.S. adversaries.",
      "SUE GORDON: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Vladimir Putin and Bashar al Assad. There were at least two chemical weapons attacks in Syria that killed thousands of people, and the U.S. intelligence community came to public assessments of high confidence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I imagine you saw all of that intelligence and you briefed on it.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when she comes out and says that she doubts it, she's skeptical, how's that going to be received by the career professionals who work for her?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes, I mentioned one of her jobs would be to be the senior adviser. The second is to be responsible for all intelligence-sharing agreements. So, our allies and partners, upon whom we rely that Syia assessment, that was joint with our allies and partners. The one we had on Skripal was joint. Our assessment of Ukraine was joint.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That was - sorry, just to explain for our viewers, Skripal, you are talking about the killing on British soil of a former Russian by Russian intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes. Right. Right. Yes, I'm sorry.",
      "But all those were jointly done with our allies and partners. We need them. It's one of the greatest strengths of America. But they will make their own assessment over whether we can be trusted with their nation's interests. And whether she meant it or not, whether she was just ill informed with that, she comes in with strikes against her in the trust perspective. Can we trust her with our most sacred intelligence to represent that in a fair way?",
      "So, I think it's a problem, whether it's judgment or any other thing that she has represented there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another nerve in the intelligence community, of course, is Edward Snowden.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Tulsi Gabbard and the selection for the attorney general, Matt Gaetz, put forward resolutions to call for the charges to be dropped against him because he leaked classified national intelligence material. He's living in Russia these days. That kind of a position, how's that going to be received?",
      "SUE GORDON: It reflects a lack of understanding of who we are, and it reflects a lack of respect for what we do. Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don't go with the good or bad any - good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths and he harmed America. He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that.",
      "There is nothing justifiable about what he's done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they're basically saying is, all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don't matter anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sue Gordon, thank you for explaining this very opaque world of intelligence to us and for your analysis today.",
      "We'll be back in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Deborah Birx served as the White House coronavirus response coordinator in Donald Trump's first term. She also had a long career in public health in the Army, working on Aids in Africa at the State Department, as well as time at the CDC.",
      "Good morning. Welcome back.",
      "DR. DEBORAH BIRX (Former White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator): Good morning, Margaret. Glad to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Dr. Birx, I want to ask you about your views on public health, which we're looking at because of this nomination potentially of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "HHS has wide portfolio here, vaccines, medicine, overseas, Medicare, regulates food, beauty products, baby formula, reproductive health care. What would the impact be of having someone without government experience in that top job?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, I think the most important thing is what team he would bring with him because you're talking about really a large cap corporation with a highly diverse group. What you have to really bring together - and frankly eliminate some of the duplications between these agencies to really become more cost effective. And so really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff perhaps, that has really come out of industry, that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because it's a very comp - HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're saying people with experience around him, we need to look at those lower level appointees Mr. Trump might make.",
      "What's so interesting with RFK Jr. is how he has, in some ways, tapped into this health movement in America. He's talking about more regulation, not less when it comes to American food.",
      "Here's some of what he's said.",
      "(BEGIN VC)",
      "ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR., HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SECRETARY NOMINEE: I'm just going to tell the cereal companies, take all the dyes out of their food. I'll get processed food out of school lunch immediately.",
      "Ten percent of food stamps go to sugar drinks, to, you know, sodas. We're creating diabetes problems in our kids by giving them food that's poison. And I'm going to stop that.",
      "(END VC)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those sound like good goals. Can he actually take on big agriculture and get that through?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think because of a lot of the people who are suffering the most from these additives are actually people in our rural areas. You know, 16 percent of the Americans live in a rural area, but they are providing all of our oil and gas, all of our fiber, all of our cotton, and all of our food. And the level of diabetes in these communities because of their access to certain foods is extraordinarily high.",
      "I just came out of the field, 58 percent of the adults in the town that I was just in had already diabetes or prediabetes based on household survey where we went house to house. This is the reality of America.",
      "And so what I'm hoping is he brings his transparency for all Americans, and we really start to tackle these issues one by one by one. I think everybody across America wants to have healthy kids that they know will grow up, and not end up with the complications of diabetes or heart disease.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was very hard for Michelle Obama, when she was first lady, to get any of that done. And it might be hard for lawmakers who come from some of those agricultural states to vote against their own interests in terms of the farm subsidies and the like.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, we're not talking about eliminating good food. We're talking about using all of their ingredients in a way that is more healthy for Americans. And I think that's what people are calling for now.",
      "Europe did it years ago. And I think we are capable of doing that. We are really smart, high levels of technology. We can make food tasty without a lot of these additives because we can see that other groups are doing it in a small way. So, we're not talking about eliminating the need for wheats and grains, we're talking about putting those together in a healthy way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about some of his - the things he said about vaccines. As you know, the vaccine - vaccination rates are declining in America. He said things like restoring transparency around them. It's not really clear what that means. Why do you think there's a decline of vaccination?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: I think there's two pieces to it. I think when we talk about things in public health, we don't acknowledge the concerns because when my children went to school, there was maybe one in 1,000 kids with autism, diagnosed autisms. Now it's three per 100. So, every mom is seeing a classroom of kindergarteners where one of the children has autism. That's scary to moms and dads. They want to know why. So, it's not good enough for us to just say, vaccines don't cause autism, it's us finding what is the cause of autism and reverse it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think a lot of people would absolutely agree that it is ridiculous that there isn't a lot of research and established causation with autism.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes. Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what he has said in the past is that autism is caused by vaccines. And there's no scientific basis for that conclusion, as I understand it.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: That's correct. And so that's why, when he talks about transparency, I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data.",
      "What I know for sure is, he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem. So, until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about, that we can't see that causation right now. But what is causing it? And so you're absolutely right, addressing what the cause is will be critical.",
      "And I think what has confused people is we weren't clear about what Covid vaccines do and don't. And so now people are questioning, well, what do my child vaccines do and don't. And they don't understand that some of the vaccines that their children are getting protect them from both disease and create herd immunity, and some of them that they get are just for their child. Like H flu (ph) and pneumo vax (ph) to protect their child from getting very serious illness. And we're just not explaining all of this correctly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why the messenger matters so much on this.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Yes, it does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is why his past statements are being scrutinized.",
      "You worked on Aids for a good part of your career. He has said that he doesn't take a position on the relationship between HIV and Aids, but then he laid out alternative theories in his book and said, \"Dr. Fauci never produced a study to demonstrate his hypothesis using accepted scientific proof.\"",
      "Do you agree with that assertion on HIV and Aids?",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: Well, having spent a career in understanding how HIV and Aids progresses, HIV virus is the cause of Aids.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Period.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: There's a whole set of things that happen, and I think what HIV taught me is you have to - it's asymptomatic for ten years. And we're finally recognizing how important asymptomatic disease progression and disease transmission is. That's what HIV taught us.",
      "But what other HIV taught us was the entire human immune system.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "DEBORAH BIRX: So, by investing in HIV research, we learned about CAR T- cells that we use today in cancer.",
      "So, a lot of these research and investments pay off in other areas. And I think once he's there at HHS, he'll see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. If he's open to the data.",
      "Dr. Birx, thank you.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Rep. French Hill, Republican of Arkansas, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we are joined now by Republican Congressman French Hill. He joins us from his district in Little Rock. Good morning to you, Congressman.",
      "REP. FRENCH HILL: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Glad to have you here. You served with Congressman Gaetz. You heard the Speaker who has said, while he doesn't want to specifically wade in to the ethics matter, he also thinks it would set a bad precedent to release a report on a former member. Do you think the Ethics Committee should make that decision for itself?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I think the Ethics Committee does make that decision for itself, but I think Speaker Johnson makes a important point, which is, Mr. Gaetz has resigned from Congress. There are many investigations that the House Ethics Committee has done, and we don't want to set a precedent where we, under any circumstances, will release documents from that committee, but that decision is theirs. Speaker Johnson has made his views known, and now it will be up to the Senate to conduct their advise and consent confirmation process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You know, CBS News reported back in June that four women informed that committee they were paid to go to sex and drug fueled parties with Mr. Gaetz. Also the Ethics Committee has Venmo transactions showing Gaetz's payments for the women, since taxpayers paid money for this report to be conducted and it was done, do you think if you were a Senate you would consider this material information to confirming the top lawmaker for the United States of America- law enforcement officer, I should say?",
      "REP. HILL: I don't, I don't have, I don't, I don't personally know any details about the ethics investigation or the allegations, because I haven't, don't serve on that committee. But your point is, would the Senate Judiciary Committee asked to see that report, and that may well be a decision that they take, and the ethics committee has a decision that they have to make, and Mike Johnson's expressed his view on on that as well. So as I say, this is an important process that the Senate has to do, advise and consent for all the nominations, and President Trump has the prerogative to nominate the people that he thinks can best lead the change that he believes the American people are seeking in each of the agencies of the federal government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have spoken to us before here on \"Face The Nation\" about your work around Syria and Bashar Al Assad's oppressive regime there. You actually visited northern Syria, an area that he wasn't in control of, back in 2017. The first lawmaker since John McCain to do so. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, when she was in office, went to Syria and met with Mr. Assad himself, then publicly, she came out and questioned U.S. intelligence assessments of his chemical weapons attacks that were carried out on civilian areas, not just once, multiple times. These were high confidence assessments by the intelligence community. Would you feel comfortable with her at the helm of all 18 of them?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, I served on the House Intelligence Committee during this past Congress, and I know the important job that the DNI performs in coordinating, collecting and reporting on our intelligence. And I think should Tulsi Gabbard be confirmed, she would know with high confidence as to precisely how we collect intelligence, how we coordinate and collaborate on it, and how we then report it to the President of the United States and to the two intelligence committees. So again, this is an important assessment for the Senate to make, but I remind you Margaret, Donald Trump won the election. He wants people that he has a good relationship with, that he trusts, that he believes can do a good job in the agencies to send the message that we want change in Washington. And the Senate, too, has their important job, and we're going to have to wait and see how the Senate handles each of these confirmations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So it was John McCain who went in 2017, you went in 2023 I may have misspoken there on the year, but so, you believe the US intelligence community conclusions, though? You don't mean to question those?",
      "REP. HILL: No, I don't.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "REP. HILL: I'm simply saying, as a member of the committee, I don't question that public assessment that's been made in the public domain over many, many years, and I've led the charge against the Assad regime. I do not support that the Arab League put him back into diplomatic standing by admitting him to the Arab League. And I think America has a lot to do to limit Assad's influence in the region, which is a partner with the Russians and the Iranians. And that's not in the interest of the United States, Iraq, Israel or peace in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have also been a supporter of Ukraine, and you've been trying to find some creative ways to help allow them to gain access to continued U.S. support. There was a tremendous attack just overnight there by Russia. The Biden administration wants to provide a $20 billion loan backed up by frozen Russian assets. Will the Congress give them permission to use that money for military assistance?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, the REPO Act that was included in the national security package I worked on very closely with Chairman Mike McCaul of the foreign affairs committee gives the United States the authority to not only take frozen assets, but confiscate them and use them for the benefit of Ukraine. The loan you're referring to has been negotiated between the Europeans and the Americans to back the Ukrainian government. I believe that will go through in my judgment. But I would urge President Trump, as he takes office, to actually follow the law and confiscate those Russian assets, as I believe that gives both Ukraine, the United States and Europe a much stronger negotiating position with Russia. And I don't believe Biden, nor the G7 countries, have been tough enough on Russian on sanctions, on the delivery of weapons that were needed to have ended this war long ago.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're gesturing to what we know, which is that this is a pretty dangerous world right now. One of the selections that the President-elect has made to run the Pentagon at this time is Pete Hegseth. He would be the defense secretary, 44 years old, decorated Army vet, TV commentator. Do you think experience is necessary, or is on the job training OK at the Pentagon?",
      "REP. HILL: Well, again, I think this will be assessed by the Senate in their confirmation process. He has a distinguished background in the military, and that counts for a lot, and I think his plans, his thoughts, his leadership, will be exposed when he goes through that Senate confirmation process. But once again, I have to say, President Trump, when he came into office in 2017 had cabinet members that he really had no personal relationship with, had no working background with. He wants to correct that this time by finding people that he has a good working relationship with. He knows how they think. They know how he thinks, because he thinks it will lead to better decision making in his administration. He's got that prerogative to nominate those men and women and the Senate will have their advice and consent function well underway, and majority leader-to-be John Thune has said look, he'll be effective. He'll be speedy. He'll take it done, get it done in the right course of action.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, thank you for your time today.",
      "REP. HILL: You bet. Thank you, Margaret."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we turn now to Democratic Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Stamford, Connecticut. Good morning to you.",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I feel like there is so much news, and I'm getting through a fraction of it frankly here. I want to- I want to pick up on Tulsi Gabbard, which we just- who we just discussed in the previous segment, she was a democratic colleague of yours for many, many years. You're the ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. She never served on that kind of committee. Do you think experience is necessary? Is she fit for the job?",
      "REP. HIMES: Margaret, how far we have come that on a major news show the question we're examining is, is experience necessary for one of the most powerful positions in the land? Of course, it's necessary. You know, it's a little bit like our obsession right now with the ethics committee report on Matt Gaetz. You know- I mean, how is it that this is what we're focusing on? Matt Gaetz is, by any standard, completely unqualified to be the Attorney General, and yet we're sort of focused on this, you know, cherry on the cupcake of the ethics report. You know, it sort of reminds me of Al Capone in 1931. Al Capone is convicted of a couple of counts of tax evasion. Now he was a killer and a rum runner and a mafioso, and yet he was convicted of tax evasion. This is what the conversation we're having about Matt Gaetz. You know, well, what about this ethics report? So, these people are manifestly unqualified, and, you know, they're not prepared to run the very complicated organizations they've been asked to run.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have any suggestion from your Republican colleagues in the Senate that either of those two individuals will not be confirmed for those positions?",
      "REP. HIMES: Look, all I would observe is that, you know, history is- is a harsh judge and- and I understand what happens to Republicans who stand up to Donald Trump. You know, talk to Adam Kinzinger or Liz Cheney, or, you know, many of the Republicans who voted for his impeachment who are now gone. I understand that. But history is a hard- hard judge and a Republican senator who takes a vote to consent to the appointment of Matt Gaetz, a chaos agent, a performative social media, no respect for the rule of law, individual. The Republican senator who votes to confirm Matt Gaetz or Robert Kennedy or Tulsi Gabbard, will be remembered by history as somebody who completely gave up their responsibility to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Speaker of the House called him one of the greatest minds in the United States or anywhere on another program this morning. On intelligence, though, because of your committee oversight, John Ratcliffe, another former House member who went on to serve in an acting role at intelligence previously, he is the selection to run the CIA. Do you trust him to appropriately handle sensitive intelligence information?",
      "REP. HIMES: I do Margaret and just to be balanced here, since I was pretty strong in my opinions about the Attorney General and the DNI nomination, I actually had a really good day when Marco Rubio was nominated for Secretary of State, when John Ratcliffe was nominated for CIA and when Mike Waltz was nominated to be national security advisor. I would even add the nominee for the Southern District of New York, Jay Clayton. Those are good nominations, not necessarily the nominations I would have made if I were president. But these are serious people with real experience. They're not social media personalities. They haven't built their careers on lies and conspiracy. So look, some of these nominations I think are quite solid, and John Ratcliffe falls in that category for me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Last night, President elect Trump was at a UFC rally, and alongside him was someone who has had a lot of scrutiny, Elon Musk. He is a billionaire with extensive US government contracts, as I understand it, holds a security clearance himself. He has extensive business ties with China. Also had with him the Saudi Arabia private investment fund governor. They invest with his son in law, Jared Kushner, and they've held golf tournaments through the- one of their entities at Trump golf courses. Do you think that in this new Congress, there will be scrutiny of potential financial conflicts of interest around Mr. Trump?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, of course there will be, right? I mean, this is, this is sort of not subject to debate. We saw Trump's first term, and the fact that that, you know, group of people weren't particularly concerned with financial conflicts of interest. And look, all- I don't know, Elon Musk, odd character, you know, you sort of have to respect what he's done to disrupt, you know, space launch, to disrupt, you know, the auto industry and whatnot. But, you know, early reviews are not good. I read his, you know, 12 point government waste manifesto, you know. And he said, look at all this money we're paying on interest on the debt. That's, you know, that's part of the wasteful spending. Guess what? You got to pay interest on the debt. And so, you know, I'm skeptical that he has any clue. Look, I- I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. I know lots of wealthy people here, and there is a syndrome where very wealthy people who got wealthy in finance or as a tech entrepreneur decide that their heart surgeons and capable of running the United States. I think that's what's going on with Elon Musk. But, you know, again, early returns are not good with respect to his ability to understand the federal bureaucracy and make it more efficient, which is a laudable goal, but I'm going to reserve judgment",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And no offense to the Fairfield County residents who voted for you. I'm sure. On Saturday, President Biden was meeting with Xi Jinping, and they met for a little less than two hours. The White House says they did discuss that pervasive hacking of U.S. telecom companies that allowed them to steal customer call record data, compromise private communications of those involved in government and copy information related to law enforcement actions. Do you know and can you say if the hackers have actually been kicked out of U.S. infrastructure, or is China still embedded?",
      "REP. HIMES: Yeah, Margaret, that's not a question I can answer with an awful lot of specificity, but the fact that we obviously know about these- these hacks means that those particular hacks probably have been addressed in one way or another. But one thing I can say with great confidence, having worked in the intelligence world for some time now, is that, I promise you, they are out there in ways that we don't know about. So my hope is that the President made it very clear that this kind of behavior is not tolerable, and that he backs that up, and quite frankly, that Donald Trump, the next president, backs that up with action. You know, as Teddy Roosevelt said, the big stick, right? We're pretty good at hacking networks too, and I think it's really important for the Chinese to understand that we're not just going to name and shame the hackers and complain about it. But that we- that we are going to go into their networks and give as good as we got. I suspect that in this realm, they need to see that we are capable of inflicting a lot of damage if they continue their present behavior.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Noted. There will be some selections as we understand it, in the coming days in the financial space. You also sit on the Financial Services Committee. Trump backer, Elon Musk, yesterday blasted one of the hedge fund CEO Scott Bessent, a crypto currency skeptic, who is being considered for that role. Howard Lutnick, the CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, apparently also being considered for that role. He is a crypto currency fan. Does either candidate stand out to you for a better pick? And what does it really project out to you about what's going to happen in this space for Mr. Trump?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, you know, it's obviously up to the president to decide who he'd like as Treasury Secretary. You know, I would note that his first Treasury Secretary, Steve Mnuchin- I certainly had disagreements with him on any number of topics, including desanctioning the Russian aluminum company. But you know, in the cast of characters in version 1.0 of the Trump administration, Steve Mnuchin was far from the creepiest and crawliest of them. So we'll see what he does on Treasury. What I will say is that, look crypto, you know, it's a little bit like the Gaetz ethics report. Crypto has yet to make an impact on most Americans' lives, and so I would just argue- and by the way, I'm open to crypto. I helped work on the legislation to regulate it, but this is not the determinative factor in our financial lives right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I know it's a technical issue. I asked you to get to fairly quickly there, Congressman. I appreciate you weighing in and thank you for your time. \"Face the Nation\" will be back in a minute."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Kentucky governor Andy Beshear who joins us from Lexington. Good morning to you, governor. You're a blue governor in a very red state. How do you even begin to try uniting a country as united- as divided as this? Are there lessons we can learn from Kentucky?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: I think there's absolute lessons that- that we can learn from Kentucky, a state where, last year, I won as a Democrat by five points and Donald Trump just won by 30. And I think it basically boils down to both running and governing, where people wake up in the morning and what they worry about when they go to bed at night. And that's not the next election. It's their job, and whether they make enough to support their family. It's the next doctor's appointment for themselves, their parents, or their kids. It's the roads and bridges they drive every day. It's that public school they drop their kids off at, and it's public safety in their community. The goal here is to focus on all of those things, where, if people don't feel secure in those areas, they don't get to anything else. They don't get to the crazy thing that some politicians said last night or this morning, they don't get to that next piece of policy that's out there. So it's a- it's about a relentless focus on people's everyday needs and their everyday life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. We're going to take a break, come back and have the rest of the conversation on the other side of it. All of you, please stay with us. More from Andy Beshear in a moment.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 Welcome back to \"Face The Nation.\" We return to our conversation with Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. Governor, Kentucky has a lot of coal. It's got natural gas. Mr. Trump has selected Chris Wright, the CEO of Liberty Energy, to be the next Energy Secretary, if confirmed. He's also selected Doug Burgum, the governor of North Dakota, to run the Interior Department, and he's promised to open up more federal lands to drilling. Do you have any idea what the impact would be on your state from the signals being sent with these selections?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, we'll see. I mean, I saw the comments recently from the CEO of Exxon, which was a little different than what we might expect, talking about needing to move to greener forms of- of energy, regardless of what the policy of the day is. And I certainly see from companies that are coming into Kentucky each and every day, we just announced a new industrial battery facility that's going to create 1600 new jobs. They demand a certain portfolio of energy. Yes, the lights have to come on, but especially over time for their customers, they want a certain amount of renewables. So what I've seen as governor is a private sector push that I do not think is going to change demands placed on states, demands placed on utilities, and the private sector ultimately moving us to a more diverse and cleaner portfolio. So here in Kentucky, yes, we have many traditional forms of energy, and they have really good jobs, and we want to make sure that we never look down on and- and we support each of those jobs. But my goal is to diversify our production as much as we can so that we have the jobs of the present and those jobs of the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said Kentucky has something like 10,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. You really made a big push on that during the campaign. Mr. Trump vowed to undo the \"electric vehicle mandate,\" that's what he called it, and he's going to, he says, repeal the law that includes credits for green projects. Do you know at this point if Republican leaders intend to keep parts of that? And are there projections on what repealing that law entirely would do to the job creation in your state?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, it's really concerning. You look at a state like Kentucky that voted for President-Elect Trump by 30 points, and it's 10,000 EV related jobs on the line, and those are only growing. Go up to Ohio and look at that $20 billion chips factory, which I'm a little bit jealous of, but happy for the people of Ohio and- and what that would mean in another state that voted for the president-elect. So you look at all of these jobs and jobs of the future that have come to what- what the administration will probably view as red states. It's important that these projects continue. Remember, a lot of the people taking these jobs, jobs that support their families, voted for President-Elect Trump because they thought that would improve their job, that he was focused on their job. So I hope that he will get good advice, and I'll do everything I can to get my message out through our federal delegation of how important these jobs are. And they're not in urban Kentucky. They're in rural Kentucky. They are game changing investments that- that have created a bright future here, and I'm certainly going to do everything I can as governor of Kentucky to protect them, and not because I'm a Democrat, but because I've shown my people that every single day I'm going to try to create a better life for them, and that's what those jobs do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, 14 billion between now and 2030 was what was promised to your state. I wonder if you just think Democrats didn't do a good job of explaining that?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I certainly don't want to do any finger pointing, because the- the Vice President had 107 days, and she did her very best, and I proudly crisscrossed the country in support of her. But what I know is, going forward, over the next couple years, we have a chance every day, every moment, to show the American people that we are laser focused on jobs, on their health care, on their infrastructure, on their kids' education, just- just those everyday worries, and with this administration, at least right now selecting some very extreme appointees, it's a chance to make a real difference, to really show people that- that we're where their basic needs are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but there was, as you know, some analysis after the fact among Democrats about the focus on some culture war issues, or so to speak. Congressman Seth Moulton said, of transgender issues, \"I have two little girls. I don't want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete. But as a Democrat, I'm supposed to be afraid to say that.\" He says he's \"speaking authentically,\" and said Democrats should do more of it. Do you think Democrats have been out of touch on some of these things that obviously resonate in states like yours?",
      "GOV. ANDY BESHEAR: Well, I think that- that all candidates should stand up for- for their beliefs and that- and that we don't have to abandon those beliefs. You know, I vetoed one of the nastiest anti-LGBTQ bills that my state had ever seen in my election year, but- but I did two things. Number one, I talked about my why, for me, that's my faith, where I'm taught that all children are children of God. And I wanted to stick up for some children that were being picked on in a pretty rough bill. But the second thing is, the- the voters in my state knew the very next day, I was going to be working on jobs. I was going to be opening a new health clinic, first hospital in our largest African American neighborhood in 150 years, we just cut the ribbon on. We've created two pediatric autism centers in- in Appalachia, so that people don't have to drive two hours. So it's- it's both sharing your why and your authentic why for- for your views, but- but the other piece is about that focus. Because remember, if we're talking about this issue of the day, and then we're talking about what Donald Trump said last night, and then we're talking about jobs. We're only spending a third of the time talking about what people are worried about and what impacts their life the most.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for joining us today. We'll be right back."

      "The following is a transcript of an interview with Sue Gordon, principal deputy director of National Intelligence in the first Trump administration, on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that aired on Nov. 17, 2024.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by Sue Gordon. She served as the Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence during Donald Trump's first term in the White House. Good to see you here again.",
      "SUE GORDON: Great to see you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you personally briefed Donald Trump as President in the Oval Office. If this nominee to be Tulsi Gabbard becomes the Director of National Intelligence, and John Ratcliffe becomes the CIA director, are you confident that Mr. Trump will be told the information he needs to know, and not just what he wants to know?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, I think that's the- I think that's the question of the day. Intelligence is weird",
      "because it's always uncertain, and you are always making an assessment so that a decision-maker can figure out what they're going to do with it. And so it's particular. And you- your only job is to ruthlessly report what you see, not what you prefer. So that's the primary job of the DNI, is to go in there and to be his principal advisor on intelligence. You're the first in, you're the last out. You cannot afford to, I'll say pander to preference. Loyalty doesn't serve you well in that job. You have to be so committed that you will say inconvenient things. I will say the former president would tell you that I would talk to him about Russian interference. I know he hated it, but Russia was in fact interfering, and he needed to hear that information. So do I believe that Tulsi and John can be that person? If they believe they must be, they can learn. If they lean on the women and men of the intelligence community, they will produce an assessment. But that's a hard day, and you better be good at it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You had to undergo an FBI background check to obtain a security clearance and to maintain it. You were a career official, 25 years at the CIA, then, as we said, moved on to national intelligence. The New York Times is reporting the Trump team may bypass the FBI process and just use a private firm to vet candidates. Then, when the president is sworn in, he can grant access to the nation's secrets rather than go through that screening. What risk is there in bypassing the FBI?",
      "SUE GORDON: Well, the first risk is that you will get an incomplete picture of the human that is carrying both the trust of the American people and the trust of our allies and partners and the trust of the women and men that are putting their lives on the line for that judgment, right? Everyone hates vetting. It's intrusive. It- you don't know why anyone should have to do it, because you know who you are. But the truth is, we know adversaries and competitors will exploit humans to be able to advance their interests, and you want to make sure that the people that hold the American people's trust and the most precious pieces of information we have of advantage, have no cracks in who they are. And so it seems expedient, but I think it will ultimately harm the institution. And by that I mean the institution of America, if you have people who we discover later that they should not have had access, or we discover later that they were vulnerable to the actions of our allies and of our adversaries and competitors\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Because of leverage on them--",
      "SUE GORDON: -- It is, I mean, that's, I mean, the craft of human intelligence is actually finding someone who has a weakness and getting them to be able to advance your interests, and it just- and what a really good day is when you find someone whose interests align with yours, and then you really push that. So a private firm isn't going to have the standards that we've had. I know it's inconvenient, but I think it's a bad strategy and risky for America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So CBS has also learned that, to date, the Trump team hasn't signed the paperwork that would start the process of the national security briefings, so that someone's not walking in cold they're briefed and up to speed, along with these background checks. The Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that helps with the transitions, confirmed that to CBS. Is there any good reason not to sign those papers, and what does it do for the officials who arrive without being read in on what's happening now?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yeah, I can't think of a- I can't think of a good reason. I think one of the great falsehoods that's been perpetrated on America is that our institutions are malfeasant. They need to be better, they need to be slimmer, they need to be more transparent, but they're not bummed. So you're not protecting anybody by not signing those papers, and especially with some of the nominees we have that don't have the really deep experience base, these are big jobs. I mean, intelligence is not just advising the president, it's also running a huge enterprise in a manner that allows our allies and partners to trust us with their most precious thing. So I can't think of a reason why that's not signed- signed, and to start your gig without any foundation at all, especially when the institutions are begging to give you that foundation just seems wrong-headed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're diplomatically referring to Tulsi Gabbard there, who doesn't have a background in intelligence. She also has a history of statements, of saying things that mirror the rhetoric of us adversaries, Vladimir Putin and Bashar al-Assad. There were at least two chemical weapons attacks in Syria that killed thousands of people, and the US intelligence community came to public assessments of high confidence. I imagine you saw all of that intelligence and you briefed on it.",
      "SUE GORDON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when she comes out and says that she doubts it. She's skeptical. How is that going to be received by the career professionals who work for her?",
      "SUE GORDON: Yeah I mentioned one of her jobs would be to be the senior advisor. The second is to be responsible for all intelligence sharing agreements so our allies and partners upon whom we rely, that Syria assessment, that was joint with our allies and partners. The one we had on Skripal was joint. Our assessment of Ukraine was joint\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013That was sorry, just to explain for our viewers, Skripal, you're talking about the killing on British soil of a former Russian by Russian intelligence.",
      "SUE GORDON: But all those were jointly done with our allies and partners. We need them. It's one of the greatest strengths of America, but they will make their own assessment over whether we can be trusted with their nation's interests, and whether she meant it or not, whether she was just ill-informed of that, she comes in with strikes against her in the trust perspective, can we trust her with our most sacred intelligence to represent that in a fair way. So I think it's a problem, whether it's judgment or any other thing that she has represented there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Another nerve in the intelligence community, of course, is Edward Snowden. Tulsi Gabbard, and the selection for the attorney general, Matt Gaetz, put forward resolutions to call for the charges to be dropped against him because he leaked classified national intelligence material. He's living in Russia these days. That kind of a position, how's that going to be received?",
      "SUE GORDON: It reflects a lack of understanding of who we are, and it reflects a lack of respect for what we do. Unauthorized disclosures of intelligence are always bad. Don't go with the good or bad, any good outcome or whether he was right or wrong. He had no authority, and he had different paths, and he harmed America. He not only harmed intelligence, he harmed our allies and partners, and he harmed our businesses by what it allowed China to assume about that. there is nothing justifiable about what he's done. None. And so if they vacate it, what they're basically saying is all those rules you follow in order to be able to serve America, they don't matter anymore.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sue Gordon, thank you for explaining this very opaque world of intelligence to us and for your analysis today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Dr. Deborah Birx served as the White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator in Donald Trump's first term. She also had a long career in public health in the army, working on AIDS in Africa, at the State Department, as well as time at the CDC. Good morning. Welcome back.",
      "FORMER WHITE HOUSE COVID RESPONSE COORDINATOR DR. DEBORAH BIRX: Good morning, Margaret. Glad to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Dr. Birx, I want to ask you about your views on public health, which we're looking at because of this nomination, potentially of Robert F Kennedy Jr. HHS has a wide portfolio here, vaccines, medicine, oversees Medicare, regulates food, beauty products, baby formula, reproductive health care. What would the impact be of having someone without government experience in that top job?",
      "DR. BIRX: Well, I think the most important thing is what team he would bring with him, because you're talking about really a large cap corporation with a highly diverse group, which you have to really bring together and, frankly, eliminate some of the duplication set between these agencies to really become more cost effective, and so really having a management person at his side, a chief of staff, perhaps that has really come out of industry that would know how to bring and look and bring those individuals together that are running the other agencies, because it's a very comp- HHS is probably one of our most complicated departments.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you're saying people with experience around him, we need to look at those lower level appointees Mr. Trump might make. Well, what's so interesting with RFK Jr. is how he has, in some ways, tapped into this health movement in America. He's talking about more regulation, not less when it comes to American food, here's some of what he said:",
      "ROBERT F KENNEDY JR.: I'm just going to tell the- the cereal companies to take all the dyes out of their food. I'll get processed food out of school lunch immediately. 10 percent of food stamps go to sugar drinks to, you know, sodas. We're creating diabetes problem, and our kids are giving them food that's poison, and I'm going to stop that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Those sound like good goals. Can you actually take on big agriculture and get that through?",
      "DR. BIRX: I think because a lot of the people who are suffering the most from these additives are actually people in our rural areas. 16 percent of the Americans live in a rural area, but they are providing all of our oil and gas, all of our fiber, all of our cotton and all of our food. And the level of diabetes in these communities because of their access to certain foods is extraordinarily high. I just came out of the field, 58 percent of the adults in the town that I was just in had already diabetes or prediabetes, based on a household survey where we went house to house. This is the reality of America and so what I'm hoping is he brings his transparency for all Americans and we really start to tackle these issues one-by-one-by-one. I think everybody across America wants to have healthy kids that they know will grow up and not end up with the complications of diabetes or heart disease.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was very hard for Michelle Obama, when she was first lady to get any of that done, and it might be hard for lawmakers who come from some of those agricultural states to vote against their own interests in terms of the farm subsidies and the like.",
      "DR. BIRX: Well, we're not talking about eliminating good food. We're talking about using all of their ingredients in a way that is more healthy for Americans and I think that's what people are calling for now. Europe did it years ago, and I think we're capable of doing that. We are really smart, high levels of technology, we can make food tasty without a lot of these additives, because we can see that other groups are doing it in a small way. So we're not talking about eliminating the need for wheats and grains. We're talking about putting those together in a healthy way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you as well about some of his- the things he said about vaccines. As you know, the vaccine- vaccination rates are declining in America. He said things like restoring transparency around them. It's not really clear what that means. Why do you think there's a decline in vaccination?",
      "DR. BIRX: I think there's two pieces to it. I think when we talk about things in public health, we don't acknowledge the concerns because when my children went to school, there was maybe one in 1000 kids with autism, diagnosed with autism. Now it's three per 100. So every mom is seeing a classroom of kindergarteners where one of the children has autism. That's scary to moms and dads, they want to know why. So it's not good enough for us to just say vaccines don't cause autism. It's us finding what is the cause of autism and reverse it\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I think a lot of people would absolutely agree that it is ridiculous that there isn't a lot of research and established causation for autism, but what he has said in the past is that autism is caused by vaccines and there's no scientific basis for that conclusion as I understand it.",
      "DR. BIRX: That's correct. And so that's why, when he talks about transparency, I'm actually excited that in a Senate hearing he would bring forward his data and the questions that come from the senators would bring forth their data. What I know for sure is he's a very smart man who can bring his data and his evidence base forward, and we can have a discussion that many Americans believe already is a problem. So until we can have that transparency and that open discussion from both sides, I know the members have incredible staffers who will bring great questions from their constituents, and that hearing would be a way for Americans to really see the data that you're talking about, that we can't see that causation right now, but what is causing it? And so you're absolutely right, addressing what the cause is will be critical and I think what has confused people is we weren't clear about what COVID vaccines do and don't. And so now people are questioning, well, what do my childhood vaccines do and don't, and they don't understand that some of the vaccines that their children are getting protect them from both disease and create herd immunity, and some of them that they get are just for their child, like H Flu and pneumovax to protect their child from getting very serious illness, and we're just not explaining all of this correctly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why the messenger matters\u2013",
      "DR. BIRX: Yes, it does.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013so much on this, which is why his past statements are being scrutinized. You worked on AIDS for a good part of your career. He has said that he doesn't take a position on the relationship between HIV and AIDS, but then he laid out alternative theories in his book, and said Dr. Fauci never produced a study to demonstrate his hypothesis using \"accepted scientific proof.\" Do you agree with that assertion, and HIV and AIDS?",
      "DR. BIRX: Well, having spent a career in understanding how HIV and AIDS progresses, HIV virus is the cause of AIDS, there's a whole set of things that happen, and I think what HIV taught me is you have to- it's asymptomatic for 10 years, and we're finally recognizing how important asymptomatic disease progression and disease transmission is. That's what HIV taught us. But what other HIV taught us was the entire human immune system. So by investing in HIV research, we learned about CAR T-cells that we use today in cancer. So a lot of these research and investments pay off in other areas and I think once he's there at HHS, he'll see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: If he's open to the data. Dr. Birx, thank you. We'll be right back."

    "summary": "The Wall Street Journal columnist talks about her new book, \"A Certain Idea of America,\" and why she believes Ronald Reagan would not recognize the Republican Party of Donald Trump.",
    "story": [
      "These days, you'll find Peggy Noonan in many places: in front of commencement crowds, at political round tables, and for the past quarter-century, in the opinion section of the Wall Street Journal. But when she was just starting out in Washington, D.C., you could find Noonan at the Off the Record Bar, near her job at the White House. \"I would sit over there by myself, I would order a beer or a glass of wine, and I'd just quietly sit and read,\" she said.",
      "In 1984, Noonan joined President Ronald Reagan's staff, after working at CBS in New York. At first, she felt like an outsider in the buttoned-up West Wing, but soon became an acclaimed speechwriter. Early on, she wrote Reagan's moving speech for D-Day's 40th anniversary.",
      "Then, when the Challenger shuttle tragically exploded, Noonan was given a tough assignment: write Reagan's address to a distraught nation. \"I had a feeling of, that didn't work, nothing worked, because nothing was worthy of that moment; nothing was worthy of that day,\" she said. \"But then Frank Sinatra called \u2013 he called that night to the White House to say, 'Mr. President, you just said what needed to be said.' And Frank didn't call after every speech!\"",
      "By the late eighties, Noonan had cemented a reputation as a wordsmith, and Reagan turned to her for his farewell address:",
      "\"We made the city stronger, we made the city freer. All in all, not bad, not bad at all.\"",
      "George H.W. Bush turned to Noonan, too, as he rallied Republicans on his way to the White House. \"You know, part of life is luck,\" she said. \"It was not lucky to follow dazzling Ronald Reagan and be plainer, seeming sturdy George H.W. Bush. But I believe history was not \u2013 certainly in his time \u2013 sufficiently fair to him.\"",
      "That opinion is one of many found in the pages of her new book, \"A Certain Idea of America,\" a collection of her recent work (to be published Tuesday by Portfolio).",
      "Asked what her idea of America is today, Noonan replied, \"Big, raucous, troubled, frayed.\"",
      "Noonan's columns often delve into questions of character and leadership. \"What I do not perceive now is many politicians who are actually saying, Guys, this is not good for the country. We've been given this beautiful thing called America. Shine it up! Keep it going!\"",
      "Costa said, \"You have a lot of fun in this book, doing what you call taking the stick to certain people from time to time.\"",
      "\"I don't mind the stick at all,\" said Noonan. \"When I see something that I think is just awful, I love to get mad at it. I got mad at John Fetterman.\"",
      "\"You don't like that he's wearing shorts?\"",
      "\"It's okay with me that he wears shorts,\" she replied, \"but he is not allowed to change the rules of the U.S. Senate to accommodate him in his little shorts and hoodie because he enjoys dressing like a child.\"",
      "Noonan, now 74, grew up in the Democratic strongholds of New York and New Jersey. \"And I was very happy with that, because Democrats were cooler than Republicans,\" she said. \"Democrats were little Bobby Kennedy, and Republicans were, like, Dick Thornburgh!\"",
      "But in Reagan, she saw something fresh. \"You looked at him, you saw his confidence, and it made you feel optimistic,\" she said.",
      "The Gipper, of course, no longer dominates the Republican Party, and President-elect Trump's victory could transform the GOP even more in the coming years. \"In terms of policy, the Republican Party has changed by becoming, not a standard, usual conservative party, but a populist party,\" Noonan said. \"Its issues have changed very much. But also, the edge of anger and resentment and, I'm afraid, a little paranoia that is in the Republican Party now would be something that Reagan did not recognize.\"",
      "At the Off the Record Bar, the faces on the wall \u2013 caricatures of politicians of the past \u2013 and at the tables still catch her eye. For Noonan, it's all part of the story \u2013 America's, and her own.",
      "Costa said, \"In a way, you're still the writer in the corner watching everybody at the bar in Washington.\"",
      "\"Yeah, I like to watch them, she said. \"They're human, and you bring a little warmth to it, a little humor, and always bring your stick and smack them when you need to! It's kind of nice.\"",

    "summary": "Scientists say they've discovered a \"mega coral\" three times bigger than the previous record holder - so huge they initially thought it was a shipwreck.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists say they have found the world's largest coral near the Pacific's Solomon Islands, announcing Thursday a major discovery \"pulsing with life and color.\" The coral is so immense that researchers sailing the crystal waters of the Solomon archipelago initially thought they'd stumbled across a hulking shipwreck.",
      "\"Just when we think there is nothing left to discover on planet Earth, we find a massive coral made of nearly one billion little polyps, pulsing with life and color,\" marine ecologist Enric Sala said.",
      "The standalone structure, formed from a \"complex network\" of tiny coral polyps, has likely been growing for 300 years or more, the researchers said.",
      "At about 111 feet wide and 104 feet long, the team said the \"mega coral\" was three times bigger than the previous record holder \u2014 a coral dubbed \"Big Momma\" in American Samoa. The massive coral is not a coral reef, structures that can be far larger but are comprised of many distinct coral colonies, they explained.",
      "\"While Big Momma looked like a huge scoop of ice cream plopped down on the reef, this newly discovered coral is as if the ice cream started to melt, spreading forever along the seafloor,\" said lead scientist Molly Timmers.",
      "It's longer than a blue whale and thought to be \"so colossal\" that it could be seen from space.",
      "The coral was discovered at the southeastern tip of the Solomon Islands, in an area known as the Three Sisters. It was spotted by a National Geographic team embarking on a scientific expedition in the region.",
      "Hotter and more acidic oceans have drained the life from corals in many of the region's tropical waters, a process called bleaching, including Australia's famed Great Barrier Reef. But this latest discovery offered a small glimmer of hope, the research team said.",
      "\"While the nearby shallow reefs were degraded due to warmer seas, witnessing this large healthy coral oasis in slightly deeper waters is a beacon of hope,\" said coral scientist Eric Brown.",
      "The lush rainforests and pristine waters of the Solomon Islands have long been celebrated for their ecological diversity. Wildlife observations made in the area in the 1920s helped prove a key part of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution.",
      "\"There is so much to learn about the richness of marine life and the ocean ecosystem, but this finding opens doors of knowledge,\" said top Solomon Islands official Collin Beck. \"More scientific research is needed to better understand our rich biodiversity and our planet.\"",
      "The discovery was announced as representatives from around the world meet in Baku, Azerbaijan for the COP29 United Nations summit on climate change.",
      "The Solomon Islands national climate minister, Trevor Manemahaga, told CBS News' partner network BBC News at the summit that his nation was proud to be the home of the massive, newly discovered coral.",
      "\"We want the world to know, that this is a special place, and it needs to be protected,\" he told the BBC. \"We rely mostly on marine resources for economic survival, so coral is very, very important.\"",

      "\"To obtain a sample from this area is really important because it's an area that otherwise we have no data for,\" said Christopher Hamilton, a planetary volcano expert at the University of Arizona who was not involved with the research.",

The first samples from that region facing away from Earth confirm an active history.",

      "China has launched several spacecraft to the moon. In 2020, the Chang'e-5 spacecraft returned moon rocks from the near side, the first since those collected by NASA's Apollo astronauts and Soviet Union spacecraft in the 1970s. The Chang'e-4 spacecraft became the first to visit the moon's far side in 2019.",
      "The moon's far side is pockmarked by craters and has fewer of the near side's flat, dark plains carved by lava flows. Why the two halves are so different remains a mystery, said study co-author Qiu-Li Li from the Chinese Academy of Sciences.",

    "story": [
      "When astronomy fans look to the sky this week, they'll get to see November's Beaver full moon, the last of 2024's four consecutive supermoons.",
      "The 2024 series of supermoons started in August with a rare supermoon blue moon. After this month's Beaver Moon, there won't be another supermoon until late next year.",
      "Why is the November full moon called the Beaver Moon?",
      "November's full moon is called the Beaver Moon, according to the Old Farmer's Almanac. The name was chosen because this is the time of year when beavers start sheltering in their lodges after having prepared food stores for the winter.",
      "This month's full moon also has several other names tied to winter and animals preparing for the cold weather. Other full names for the November full moon are the Frost Moon, the Freezing Moon, the Digging Moon, the Deer Rutting Moon and the Algonquin Whitefish Moon.",
      "When will the November supermoon be visible?",
      "The full moon is expected to reach its peak on Friday, Nov. 15, at 4:29 p.m. EST, NASA said. The Old Farmer's Almanac details specific moonrise times for different ZIP codes across the U.S.",
      "Around 96% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated by the sun on Thursday, according to NASA. By Friday, 100% of the moon's nearside will be illuminated. About 99% of it will be illuminated by the sun on Saturday and 96% of the moon will be illuminated on Sunday.",
      "You won't need binoculars or a telescope to enjoy the spectacular view.",
      "What makes supermoons special?",
      "A supermoon happens when the moon is simultaneously full and at the part of its orbit that's closest to Earth, according to NASA. The moon's distance from Earth varies between around 221,457 miles and 252,712 miles.",
      "During this month's supermoon, the moon will be about 224,385 miles from Earth.",
      "Supermoons appear larger than the average full moon. It's similar to the size difference between a quarter and a nickel, according to NASA. Supermoons are also about 16% brighter than an average moon.",
      "While all supermoons appear bigger and brighter than the average full moon, there is some variance. According to NASA, the November full moon will appear 6.2% bigger and 12.8% brighter than 2024's average full moon.",
      "When will the first supermoon of 2025 occur?",
      "Next year, expect three supermoons, starting in October, according to earthsky.org. There will be one on Oct. 7, 2025, followed by Nov. 5 and Dec. 4. Then the following new year will start with a supermoon on Jan. 3, 2026.",

      "It's not the first time Google's chatbots have been called out for giving potentially harmful responses to user queries.

      "Temu and Shein have won over\u00a0many Gen Z shoppers and other bargain hunters by offering low-cost clothing, electronics and other items that typically ship directly from manufacturers in China. At the same time, U.S. consumers are still feeling the bite of inflation that hit a 40-year high in the pandemic, with many searching for deals as a result.",
      "\"Amazon Haul is a response to both the rise of low-price Chinese marketplaces and the fact that consumers are increasingly seeking value for money as they try to make their budgets stretch further,\" said Neil Saunders, managing director of market research firm GlobalData.",
      "He added, \"The value retail segment has been a major growth area over the past few years, and while the regular Amazon site has a good value-for-money reputation, its wide offer means that it is not primarily seen as an everyday low-price destination.\"",
      "What is Amazon Haul?",
      "Amazon Haul is an online storefront within the Amazon app that sells low-cost items, aimed especially at consumers who shop at discount retailers such as Temu and Shein.",

    "summary": "Two women testified before the House Ethics Committee that Matt Gaetz paid them \"for sex,\" their lawyer told CBS News' Major Garrett.",
    "story": [
      "Two women interviewed by the House Ethics Committee about former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be attorney general, testified that Gaetz paid them directly and repeatedly in Venmo transactions \"for sex,\" and that those transactions were obtained by the committee, an attorney for the women told CBS News. The attorney, Joel Leppard, also said the women testified that Gaetz inquired in text messages about \"party favors\" and \"vitamins\" at upcoming parties, which was understood to be code for drugs.",
      "Leppard, who is based in Orlando, said his clients testified that they attended parties from 2017 to January 2019 where Gaetz was present and sex and drug use took place. In an interview Monday with CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett, Leppard said one of his clients testified before the House Ethics Committee that she witnessed Gaetz having sex with a 17-year-old girl against a game table at a July 2017 party. Gaetz was sworn into Congress in January 2017, so all of the events the women allege took place while he was a member of the House.",
      "Officials with the Trump transition team did not respond to requests for comment Monday. One source familiar with Gaetz's legal position questioned the credibility of the women and argued their recollections would not have withstood cross examination in court, had it come to that.",
      "Gaetz, who has denied all wrongdoing, including having sex with a minor, has blasted the committee's investigation against him and on Thursday called the testimony about him a \"false smear.\"",
      "Gaetz's conduct was also investigated by federal prosecutors, but they ended the probe in 2023 without filing charges.",
      "As the House Ethics Committee weighs whether to release its report, which investigated allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and bribery, Leppard said his clients want the public to know they are telling the truth.",
      "One of his clients said in a text to Leppard, \"'Regardless of how many times he tries to distract from the truth, the public deserves to know that what we all experienced was real and actually happened.'\"",
      "\"My clients are not political; they didn't vote in the last two elections \u2014 they don't care one way or another,\" Leppard told Garrett. \"But they do want the public to know that they are not lying. They did not come forward willingly \u2014 they have never spoken to anyone without a force of a legal subpoena.\"",
      "He continued, \"And if the American people would know, then they could decide if that's the person they want to be the next attorney general.\"",
      "One of Leppard's clients is among at least four women who have told the committee they were paid to attend parties with drugs and sex where Gaetz was present, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. Her account corroborates the testimony of the then-minor, who told the committee that she had sex with Gaetz when she was 17 years old.",
      "At the July 2017 party where his client alleges this occurred, Leppard said she and others were \"at the party in order to provide entertainment, to be happy, to be lively and provide sexual favors for the gentlemen that were present.\"",
      "\"The expectation was that they would have sexual intercourse,\" Leppard said his clients testified about these parties. \"They testified to the House that \u2014 and the House actually had their Venmo transactions, PayPal transactions, of Representative Gaetz.\"",
      "Leppard said the House panel asked the women about Gaetz's PayPal and Venmo transactions.",
      "\"'What was this for? What was this for,'\" Leppard said his clients were asked.",
      "\"'This was for sex,'\" he said they responded. \"'This was for sex. This was for sex.'\"",
      "Leppard said the payments were typically between $200 and $500 at a time.",
      "He said his clients also testified that sometimes, someone other than Gaetz would make a payment on his behalf. On at least one occasion, according to Leppard, that was Nestor Galban, a Cuban immigrant who is close to Gaetz and whom Gaetz has referred to as his \"son.\" He said other payments on Gaetz's behalf were made by Gaetz associate Joel Greenberg, who was convicted in 2022 of sex trafficking of a minor and other crimes.",
      "Leppard said his client who testified that she saw Gaetz having sex with the 17-year-old also told the panel she did not believe Gaetz was aware of her age at the time.",
      "\"My client, at least, testified that he did not know her age,\" Leppard said.",
      "Leppard's client testified that she knew the 17-year-old girl and her age, and said the two attended high school together.",
      "His client testified that she had sex with Gaetz after arriving at the July 2017 house party. Later during the party, his client testified, she was walking outside when she saw Gaetz having sex with her friend, the 17-year-old, against the gaming table.",
      "Leppard said one of his clients provided more than 100 texts involving Gaetz to the committee. Frequently, Leppard said, the texts his client provided showed Gaetz would have to be reminded to pay.",
      "\"There was a lot of texts requesting payment, like, 'Hey, when are you going to pay me?'\" Leppard said. \"Or, 'I don't want to be that girl, but can you please go ahead and pay me what we agreed upon?' Text messages along those lines. The texts the House was more interested in was the ones where Representative Gaetz was seemingly requesting that drugs be present.\"",
      "\"So, in my line of work as a criminal defense attorney, no one ever requests, 'Can you give me some drugs, please?'\" Leppard said. \"They usually use code words. And so Representative Gaetz would use terms like, 'Can you make sure that there are party favors present?' Or, 'Who's in charge of party favors?' He used the term 'party favor mecca' when he was referring to another individual who was bringing party favors. He also used the term 'vitamins,' I believe.\"",
      "Still, Leppard's clients told the House panel they could not specifically recall whether they had seen Gaetz use marijuana or other drugs.",
      "The texts also included a \"lot of positive emojis,\" Leppard said, like hearts, and \"positive statements\" back and forth between Gaetz, his clients and others. Leppard characterized the relationship with Gaetz as a complicated one, but also one of friendship, and he also told Garrett that his clients knew Gaetz's girlfriend at the time.",
      "\"At least one of my clients testified that, in a sense, they were required to please Mr. Gaetz before going out and attending their [Electronic Dance Music] show,\" Leppard said of one alleged occasion about which his client testified. \"And that was something that was of particular interest to the House. Representative Gaetz's girlfriend texted them, and they essentially took care of their duties, and later on, they went to see their show.\"",
      "Leppard said his clients have \"been through heck\" and are worried that if they testify before the Senate or anywhere else publicly, \"they might not be safe in their jobs.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee had planned to vote Friday, Nov. 15, on releasing its report, but the meeting was canceled after Trump announced his intention Wednesday to nominate Gaetz, and then a few hours later, the Florida Republican abruptly resigned from Congress. The panel is now set to meet Wednesday, two sources told CBS News.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 17:25:04 -0500",
    "summary": "Spirit's bankruptcy filing will affect airfares across the board, whether you fly Spirit or not, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Spirit Airlines, the airline of choice for many budget travelers, filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, raising questions about the viability of no-frills airlines in the post-pandemic era, as consumer preferences shift toward more premium offerings.",
      "Customers with plans to fly on the airline over Thanksgiving and beyond are also concerned about what the filing means for their upcoming trips, as well as airfares generally.",
      "Spirit has entered into a restructuring agreement\u00a0with its bondholders in order to reduce the airline's debt and provide it with increased financial flexibility, Spirit said in an open letter to customers Monday. The longterm aim, Spirit said, is to provide its guests \"with enhanced travel experiences and greater value.\"",
      "The airline, known for its bargain fares, said it expects to emerge from bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2025, \"even better positioned to deliver the best value in the sky.\"",
      "Industry experts attribute Spirit's financial woes in part to changing consumer preferences as they\u00a0demand more amenities while flying.",
      "\"We can clearly see that consumer preferences have changed in favor of a more premium product, and the low-cost airlines are struggling,\" Jungho Suh, management professor at George Washington University School of Business told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They don't want to see any added costs, they want an all-in, full-service offering.\"",
      "What if I am booked on a Spirit flight?",
      "Spirit plainly states that customers with existing reservations can still use their tickets. Their flight credits and loyalty points are also still valid, and can be redeemed as usual. Customers may also make new reservations for future travel.",
      "\"The most important thing to know is that you can continue to book and fly now and in the future,\" the airline said.",
      "Additionally, Spirit customers can still benefit from the airline's Free Spirit loyalty program, as well as accrue and redeem Saver$ Club perks and credit card terms.",
      "Schedule modifications",
      "That said, industry experts advise customers to keep a close eye on their upcoming bookings. That includes updating their contact information so that the airline can reach them with modifications to their flights.",
      "\"Make sure your contact information is up to date, and keep an eagle eye on your reservations,\" Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy \u2014 a site focused on airline deals and travel rewards \u2014 told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "There's no need to panic, Kelly said, but the airline is expected to trim its schedule, which could result in your flight time changing, or being canceled.",
      "\"They're not going to stop flying tomorrow, but inevitably they're going to emerge an even smaller airline after this process, so that means there are going to be some hiccups with routes,\" he said.",
      "Aviation industry consultant Robert Mann said some consumers who were accustomed to flying Spirit out of major airports may have to fly out of a smaller hub, as Spirit withdraws from major hubs served by legacy carriers.",
      "\"You could see that happen where Spirit decided to compete, and has now decided it wasn't such a good idea,\" he said.",
      "What will happen to airfares?",
      "Spirit and other low-cost carriers have helped depress airfares, even for consumers who don't fly on budget airlines.",
      "\"Whether you like them or not, having ultra low-cost carriers is good for our overall aviation ecosystem and good for consumers, even if you never buy them,\" Kelly said.",
      "Spirit will emerge a smaller airline, which means there will be fewer low-cost flights on most routes, and airfares could rise across the board.",
      "\"The smaller Spirit is and the less routes they serve, the less pressure there will be on other airlines in those markets, resulting in overall higher fares,\" Kelly said. \"This isn't good for consumers. There's no positive side to this.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s concerns about the health effects of fluoride may already be helping some Americans \u2014 investors in dental services companies.",
      "Shares in Dentsply Sirona, Envista, Henry Schein Patterson Companies, and other providers of dental products are jumping, with Wall Street betting that a potential push by the incoming Trump administration to remove fluoride from the nation's drinking water could spur demand for the companies' services.",
      "Kennedy, tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said on social media just ahead of the November 5 presidential election that Trump would rid fluoride from the public water supply on his first day in office. Kennedy, a noted vaccine skeptic, has described fluoride as an \"industrial waste\" and linked it to arthritis, neurological deficiencies in children and other serious health problems.",
      "\"The thought here is RFK will bring to HHS a voice that is in favor of reducing, or eliminating, the amount of fluoridation that is added to drinking water,\" Don Bilson, Gordon Haskett's head of event-driven research, told investors in a report, according to\u00a0NBC News. \"This will, in turn, lead to an acceleration of tooth decay and more dental visits.\"",
      "Dental experts have largely refuted such claims. Dr. Aaron Yancoskie, associate dean of academic affairs at Touro College of Dental Medicine, told\u00a0\"CBS Mornings Plus\"\u00a0on November 13 that there is \"excellent, solid data going back 75 years showing that fluoride is both safe, and it's extremely effective at decreasing dental decay, that is, cavities, by strengthening the enamel of our teeth.\"",
      "According to\u00a0KFF Health News, some studies have linked fluoride exposure among pregnant women to a higher risk of childhood neurobehavioral problems and lower IQs, leading experts to call for further research.",

    "summary": "Trump has indicated that the revelations about the accuser and payment have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to serve as defense secretary, paid a confidential financial settlement to a woman who accused him of sexual assault out of concern that the allegation would lead to his firing from the cable news giant, his lawyer told CBS News.",
      "Hegseth's attorney, Timothy Parlatore, said the Army veteran reached a confidential settlement agreement to deter his accuser from going forward with a lawsuit, maintaining that he is innocent and the sexual encounter was consensual. Hegseth denies any wrongdoing.",
      "\"The reality is that, had they filed [a lawsuit], civil process takes quite a while, and so Fox News likely would have fired him based on the allegation,\" said Parlatore, adding that the woman and her attorney \"knew that simply filing it would cause an immediate horror storm for [Hegseth].\"",
      "Fox News Media said in a statement Monday it \"was not made aware of the incident or the settlement.\"",
      "Trump's transition team spoke with Parlatore after Hegseth was named as Trump's nominee defense secretary, the attorney said. He said that he \"explained this fully\" to them but that he did not know what prior conversations Hegseth had with the transition team, or if they had been informed about the sexual assault allegation and settlement agreement before the announcement of his impending nomination for defense secretary.",
      "\"This should have nothing to do with the confirmation process,\" he said.",
      "Trump has indicated that these revelations have not deterred him from Hegseth's selection as defense secretary. After reports surfaced of the sexual assault accusation, Trump's communications director Steven Cheung said, \"President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his Administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all accusations, and no charges were filed.\"",
      "The alleged sexual assault took place after midnight on Oct. 8, 2017, at the Hyatt Regency Monterey Hotel and Spa. The woman, whose identity has been kept confidential, filed a complaint with the Monterey Police Department four days later alleging that she had been sexually assaulted by Hegseth. The city of Monterey confirmed the 2017 investigation into Hegseth and said in a statement that investigators found the woman had \"contusions\" on her right thigh. No charges were filed, Parlatore said.",
      "The Washington Post, which first reported the financial payment, obtained what it referred to as a memo that was sent to the Trump transition team by a friend of the accuser alleging Hegseth raped a conservative group staffer in his room after drinking at the hotel bar. According to the Post, the memo states that the day after the incident, the accuser \"had a moment of hazy memory of being raped the night before, and had a panic attack.\"",
      "CBS News has not seen the memo and cannot verify its contents.",
      "Parlatore told CBS News that there is eyewitness testimony and video surveillance footage that allegedly shows the accuser was the \"aggressor\" in a consensual sexual encounter. \"[Hegseth] was intoxicated. She was sober. She was the one grabbing him by the arm and leading him out of the bar to take him upstairs,\" he said.",
      "When asked if CBS News could view the footage, Parlatore said, \"No.\" He also declined to share the names of any eyewitnesses.",
      "CNN reported that it spoke with the alleged victim last week, who \"became visibly distraught at the mention of Hegseth's name.\" CNN says she declined to be interviewed at the time and then stopped responding.",
      "Parlatore would not share the exact timing of the settlement payment to the woman. He said it occurred \"a couple years ago,\" emphasizing that it was \"well before Trump was even nominated [for the presidency], let alone had named Pete to this position.\"",
      "He also declined to disclose the amount of the settlement, only saying it was \"far, far less than what she wanted.\" He characterized it as \"essentially an extortion and blackmail.\"",
      "Two years after the alleged incident, Parlatore said that Hegseth was informed the woman was making what they called \"false claims\" against him and was threatening to sue him. Parlatore said that she had lost her job and claimed she needed money. In February of 2020, he sent her a cease-and-desist letter. She went \"quiet for a year\" before he learned she had found an attorney for her case.",
      "Trump's selection of Hegseth has been plagued with controversy. The announcement that the Fox News personality was his choice for secretary of Defense took many in Washington by surprise. \"Wow,\" responded Alaska Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski upon learning he had been picked to lead the Defense Department. \"I just said, wow,\" she repeated when asked for her thoughts.",
      "Even Hegseth's\u00a0tattoos have attracted scrutiny, specifically the \"Deux Vult\" tattoo on his inner bicep. The symbolism of that tattoo, which has been tied to extremist groups and the Christian Crusaders, alarmed a member of Hegseth's National Guard unit, who warned superiors that Hegseth was a potential \"insider threat\" before President Joe Biden's inauguration. He was removed from guarding the inauguration.",
      "After The Associated Press reported Hegseth had been flagged as a threat, Vice President-elect JD Vance defended him on social media, accusing the outlet of \"attacking Pete Hegseth for having a Christian motto tattooed on his arm.\"\u00a0Hegseth then shared Vance's tweet, commenting, \"They can target me \u2014 I don't give a damn \u2014 but this type of targeting of Christians, conservatives, patriots and everyday Americans will stop on DAY ONE at DJT's DoD.\"",
      "The news of Hegseth's financial settlement agreement with a confidentiality clause may ring familiar to Trump. The president-elect's own troubles related to a nondisclosure agreement with adult film star Stormy Daniels led to the New York trial in which he became a convicted felon, as well as the first former (and now future) president to be criminally prosecuted.",
      "Trump was found\u00a0guilty on 34 counts\u00a0of falsifying business records related to an alleged cover-up of the payment to Daniels. He has argued that the verdict should be overturned and the indictment dismissed on the basis, among other things, of the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The House Ethics Committee is set to meet Wednesday as it faces increasing pressure to release a potentially damaging report detailing its investigation into allegations former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, two sources told CBS News.",
      "The movements of the Ethics panel have been under heightened scrutiny since President-elect Donald Trump announced last week that he had selected Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The Florida Republican resigned his seat in the House in the wake of the announcement, which ended the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction over Gaetz since he is now a former member.",
      "The Ethics Committee declined to comment on the upcoming meeting. The panel was supposed to meet Friday to vote on releasing the report, but Trump tapped Gaetz for the nation's top law enforcement officer days earlier. The committee then postponed its meeting.",
      "Gaetz must win Senate confirmation to serve as attorney general, and senators have been calling to see the Ethics Committee's report as they weigh whether to approve his nomination. Any confirmation hearings, which would be conducted by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would not take place until next year after Trump is inaugurated. Republicans will gain control of the upper chamber in the next Congress, which begins Jan. 3.",
      "Sen. John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters last week that he believes senators should have access to the Ethics Committee's findings.",
      "\"I think there should not be any limitations on the Senate Judiciary Committee's investigation, including whatever the House Ethics Committee has generated,\" said Cornyn, who sits on the Judiciary Committee.",
      "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, a Trump ally, similarly told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he believes the Senate should be able to see the report on Gaetz.",
      "\"Congress has to advise and consent, and Matt Gaetz is going to go through the same scrutiny as every other individual, and I'm going to give him a fair shot, just like every individual, and at the end of the day, the Senate has to confirm him,\" he said.",
      "But House Speaker Mike Johnson has cautioned against the release of the report by the Ethics Committee, warning in an interview Sunday that doing so for someone who is not a current House member \"would be a Pandora's box.\"",
      "\"What I have said with regard to the report is that it should not come out. And why? Because Matt Gaetz resigned from Congress. He is no longer a member,\" Johnson told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"There's a very important protocol and tradition and rule that we maintain that the House Ethics Committee's jurisdiction does not extend to non-members of Congress.\"",
      "The House Ethics Committee first began its investigation into allegations of misconduct against Gaetz in April 2021, but deferred its consideration in response to a request from the Justice Department. It resumed its investigation in May 2023 after federal investigators declined to charge Gaetz following their sex-trafficking and obstruction probe.",
      "Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing and blamed the ethics probe on former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. He has called the investigation a \"smear.\" The Florida congressman helped lead the historic effort to strip McCarthy\u00a0of the speaker's gavel last year.",
      "The ethics panel said in June that it had spoken with more than a dozen witnesses, issued 25 subpoenas and reviewed thousands of pages of documents as part of its investigation into Gaetz, and determined that \"certain allegations merit continued review.\"",
      "The committee said it was examining accusations Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, accepted improper gifts, gave \"special privileges and favors\" to people close to him and sought to obstruct government investigations into his conduct.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News at the time that four women told the Ethics Committee that they had been paid to go to parties, which Gaetz attended, that included sex and drugs. The panel has the Florida Republican's Venmo transactions that allegedly show payments for the women. One woman who testified to the Ethics Committee said she had sex with Gaetz at a party in 2017, just after he was elected to Congress and when she was 17 years old, sources told CBS News at the time",
      "Her lawyer, John Clune, said on social media last week that she was a high school student and \"there were witnesses.\"",
      "\"We would support the House Ethics Committee immediately releasing their report,\" Clune wrote.",
      "Nikole Killion is a CBS News congressional correspondent based in Washington D.C.

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could wield significant authority to directly affect how and whether Americans get vaccines\u00a0nationwide, current and former federal health officials say, if he is confirmed next year to head the Department of Health and Human Services under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The position would grant Kennedy authority over efforts like the Vaccines for Children program, which is estimated to have saved 1.1 million lives by immunizing children against diseases like polio and measles that are now rare thanks to the shots.",
      "Many public health experts have decried the pick, saying Kennedy's past claims about vaccines are disqualifying.",
      "\"A serious candidate for this position would follow the decades of real-world evidence that shows that vaccines are safe and prevent as many as 5 million deaths each year,\" Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said Monday in a statement.",
      "Is RFK Jr. anti-vaccine?",
      "Kennedy has insisted he is not \"anti-vaccine\" and promised not to try to ban the shots under the Trump administration \u2014 but he has a long record of making misleading statements about vaccines and fanning doubts about their proven benefits and safety.",
      "He wrote a now-retracted article in 2005 falsely claiming autism was linked to a discontinued ingredient in vaccines, and continues to say he thinks vaccines are a cause of autism, which decades of scientific research has thoroughly discredited.",
      "On social media, Kennedy called COVID shots \"a crime against humanity\" and claimed children did not need COVID vaccines. (Research\u00a0estimates\u00a0that COVID vaccines prevented 3.2 million deaths in the U.S. through 2022.)",
      "The group he chaired, Children's Health Defense, has been denounced by experts for being among the most prolific spreaders of misinformation about vaccines.",
      "In recent months, Kennedy has\u00a0said his goal is to \"provide Americans with transparency and access to all the data so they can make informed choices.\" He also wants to clean house at federal health agencies, ousting \"corrupt\" officials he claims have clouded \"their rich tradition of gold-standard, evidence-based science.\"",
      "The head of the FDA's vaccines program says he hopes Kennedy will \"keep an open mind\" about what the science shows.",
      "\"Perhaps engaging in that dialogue, especially if it's in a public venue, it may help. It may help bring some of the rest of the country along because sometimes as somebody is convinced, perhaps, maybe some of the rest of the country will be,\" Dr. Peter Marks, head of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said earlier this month.",
      "CDC recommendations and covering costs",
      "One of the biggest roles that the CDC plays in vaccinations is in deciding which vaccines health insurers are required to cover. Nearly all plans are required by law to cover routine shots that are recommended by the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.",
      "Updating that \"schedule\" of routinely recommended vaccines is usually a monthslong process for the committee, which is made up of medical experts who work to publicly analyze and vote on the benefits and risks of different shots.",
      "Those meetings happen at least three times every year, as the committee debates newly approved vaccines, annual updates to routine shots like influenza or COVID-19 and reevaluating the data on older immunizations.",
      "\"They incorporate epidemiology. Which groups are most affected? Are there certain subgroups that it is most effective for? Are there some groups that may not benefit very much from a certain vaccine,\" said Dr. Carolyn Bridges, the CDC's former associate director for adult immunizations.",
      "Bridges, who now works as a consultant on adult vaccinations, praised the \"very public discussion and often very rigorous debate\" among the experts selected to serve on the committee.",
      "The CDC's career civil servants are traditionally able to offer input into which experts are chosen for the panel, and federal law says the committee's membership should be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view.\"",
      "But, it will be Kennedy's decision alone to decide who sits on the committee. Kennedy's pick to head the CDC would also have the authority to override the panel's votes, as was done in 2021 to roll out some COVID-19 booster shots.",
      "The panel's recommendations have a wide impact beyond insurance coverage, Bridges said, influencing how doctors and local health departments talk about and offer the shots.",
      "Kennedy and his pick to head the CDC could also affect the agency's wide-ranging immunization work in other ways.",
      "For example, the agency is responsible for the Vaccines for Children program that supplies shots to pediatricians nationwide to ensure no-cost access for uninsured children. It also routinely steps in to sort out any confusion among providers over vaccine recommendations.",
      "The CDC also runs the main national data sources tracking immunization rates, vaccine effectiveness for some common shots and ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety.",
      "\"It's really the integration of all of those things. There's a lot that goes into this \u2014 the policy, the monitoring, the coordination, the communication,\" Bridges said.",
      "FDA approvals and regulations",
      "Kennedy and whoever he picks to lead the FDA would also play a big role in both the approval of vaccines and in regulating them after they are on the market.",
      "Decisions on whether to approve or reject applications from vaccine makers are traditionally left up to career scientists working in the agency's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. That is mostly ensured only by norms, not law.",
      "\"It's totally within the law for the president or the HHS secretary to overrule the entire FDA. And so, that could happen. Did it happen to me? No. But I also want to say, I think the view that there's a sharp line between the political and scientific, we got to speak truthfully about this,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Robert Califf said Nov. 11, speaking at an event hosted by the Friends of Cancer Research.",
      "Califf said that \"99.95% of FDA decisions about individual products\" are made by civil servants with scientific expertise in the field. But the commissioner is sometimes forced to step in, like to resolve internal disagreements or appeals from outside the agency.",
      "Kennedy and his FDA commissioner could also influence vaccines in other ways, like through guidance the agency issues to manufacturers seeking approval.",
      "Policy changes recommended by the agency's staff can be stalled or rejected by political leaders. Major changes to FDA's rules are also funneled through the White House, which has the ability to block them.",
      "\"There's so many other aspects of this that are integrated in various ways with politics. And there's just no way around it,\" Califf said.",
      "Communicating risks and benefits",
      "Beyond Kennedy's direct authority over vaccines, another major way he and his picks to head the CDC and FDA could influence public opinion is through how they approach talking to Americans about the risks and benefits of vaccines.",
      "The department funds a number of efforts to survey public confidence in vaccines and study ways to improve it. They also run a number of campaigns to promote recommended shots, like advertising about the annual COVID-19 and flu vaccines or helping health departments respond to backsliding immunization rates in schools.",
      "\"We don't have to remember too far back to see what happens because of vaccination rates, when there aren't requirements and people don't have access,\" said Bridges, citing a polio case that emerged in New York in 2022.",
      "Outbreaks of polio once killed thousands of Americans and left many survivors paralyzed, until the disease was virtually eliminated in the U.S. by vaccines that first rolled out in the 1950s.",
      "The return of polio prompted an investigation by health authorities and a renewed push for vaccinations, though officials acknowledged they struggled to \"meaningfully increase\" immunization coverage.",
      "\"That's just mind-boggling that we can have a polio resurgence, in a country with all of our resources. It doesn't take all that much for diseases still circulating in other places to retake hold,\" said Bridges.",
      "Another way the communications role comes up is in navigating how to explain potential risks flagged by federal vaccine safety systems to doctors and the public.",
      "An example last year came after the FDA and CDC officials worked to craft a bulletin disclosing early concerns that COVID-19 shots might be increasing the risk of stroke for seniors, while also explaining why the preliminary \"safety signal\" did not warrant stopping use of the shots.",
      "Intense scrutiny of the issue by the U.S. and health authorities overseas eventually found \"no evidence of a safety concern,\" though health authorities continue to closely study the issue.",
      "The benefits of the vaccine continue to far outweigh this theoretical risk, the CDC's advisers concluded, especially among seniors who are at higher risk of severe illness or death from COVID.",
      "\"The current evidence does not support the existence of a safety issue. FDA and CDC will continue to evaluate data as they are available and update the public as needed,\" the FDA said.",

    "story": [
      "Canada's Bestar has agreed to a more than $16 million civil penalty for failing to report\u00a0a defect in its wall beds until after one person was killed and more than a dozen others injured, some seriously, federal officials say.",
      "Starting in September of 2014 and continuing through 2022, Bestar received numbers of reports that the products had detached from the wall. By 2016, the company was told of two cases in which people had been injured by the beds falling on them, according to a settlement agreement announced on Monday by the Consumer Product Safety Commission.",
      "The furniture company then engaged with CPSC and Health Canada, but did not tell regulators of an additional five incidents it had become aware of by that time, the document said. In 2018, a Bestar wall bed fell on an elderly woman, causing injuries that led to her hospitalization and death later that year.",
      "All told, Bestar was aware of 35 incidents in which its beds detached from walls and fell on people, resulting in the fatality and 15 injuries, some of which were serious, according the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Bestar knowingly failed to immediately report that its wall beds posed a serious impact and crushing hazard, as is required by law, the agency said Monday in a news release.",
      "The CPSC has agreed to suspend all but $4 million of the $16.025 penalty because paying more than that would cause the company to go out of business.",
      "Bestar and the commission announced a recall of the wall beds on April 7, 2022, warning consumers that a 79-year-old woman had died after a wall bed fell on her, injuring her spine. Bestar and the CPSC at that time stated the company had received reports of 60 additional incidents resulting in bruising and other injuries from the beds detaching and hitting people.",
      "About 129,000 of the wall beds were sold in the U.S. from June 2014 through March 2022 online at Amazon.com, Costco.com, Cymax.com and Wayfair.com. Bestar also sold roughly 53,000 of the wall beds in Canada.",
      "The commission explained the discrepancy between the lower number of incidents noted in its current press release and the higher case count in its 2020 recall as a matter of what the company had reported at specific times.",
      "\"Our penalty cases focus on when the firms reported to us; not the recall date. So, it is earlier in time; thus, fewer incidents,\" a CPSC spokesperson stated in an email.",
      "The settlement does not constitute an admission of guilt by Bestar to allegations including it knowingly broke the law, it said in the document. The company had not received \"substantiated claims\" that its beds had fallen on people so long as they were properly assembled and anchored to the wall.",
      "Bestar did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",
      "Bestar purchased Bush Industries in 2020, with both brands now operating under a corporate parent, eSolutions Furniture Group, which was established in 2021 and is based in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada.

      "A judge Tuesday set Feb. 25 as the start of Bannon's trial on charges related to alleged money laundering, conspiracy and a scheme to defraud. The case stems from Bannon's alleged role in an organization that raised millions on the promise \u2014 during Trump's first term in office \u2014 that they would privately build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "Bannon and the now-defunct group, called We Build the Wall, are accused of pocketing donations. He has entered a not guilty plea in the case and called the charges \"nonsense,\" accusing Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of pursuing allegations out of political animus.",
      "The judge also ruled prosecutors could show jurors evidence that some of the charity's funds were used to cover more than $600,000 in credit card debt owed by another not-for-profit run by Bannon.",
      "Trial in the case was originally scheduled for November 2023, but has been delayed repeatedly.",
      "Bannon was indicted on federal charges in a similar case in August 2020, but Trump pardoned him as one of his last acts before leaving office in 2021 after his defeat to President Biden.",
      "Presidents cannot issue pardons for state charges. As Trump enters the second month of his new presidency, his former senior counsel and White House chief strategist will be in court.",
      "Bannon completed a four-month federal prison sentence just three weeks ago. He was incarcerated for defying a subpoena from a congressional committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "Although Bannon already served that sentence, he could still be eligible for a pardon, which can help eliminate some consequences of conviction, according to Justice Department guidelines. Trump has promised while campaigning this year to pardon many of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists, but has not said specifically if Bannon will be included in that group.",

The animal was tagged outside the Mexican Wolf Experimental Population Area, a designated space near Flagstaff where conservation efforts have focused for decades. Following a period in the 1970s when the population of Mexican wolves in the southwestern U.S. and Mexico declined almost to the point of extinction, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service started releasing Mexican wolves born through a breeding program into the conservation area in 1998.",

    "summary": "A Russian lawmaker calls President Biden's decision to let Ukraine fire U.S. missiles deep into Russia a \"very big step toward the beginning\" of a third world war.",
    "story": [
      "President Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to fire U.S.-made and supplied missiles deeper into Russia \u2014 a major policy shift announced over the weekend after months of intense lobbying by Kyiv \u2014 has drawn a furious response from Moscow. While there was no immediate reaction directly from the man who launched the nearly three-year war on his neighboring nation, lawmakers aligned with President Vladimir Putin in Russia said Monday that the move was unacceptable and warned it could lead to a third world war.",
      "Mr. Biden authorized Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to use American-made missiles with a range of almost 200 miles, known as ATACMS, to strike deeper inside Russian territory than the Ukrainians have to date.",
      "So far, Ukraine's attacks beyond the immediate border region inside Russia have been limited to non-U.S. \u2014 and much less potent\u2014\u00a0 weapons such as explosive drones. ATACMS are far more destructive and harder to shoot down as they head for their programmed targets.",
      "Zelenskyy's government had been pushing Washington for permission to use the missiles for long-range attacks for some time but the Biden administration had been reluctant given concerns about potentially escalating the war.",
      "Over the weekend, however, the calculus apparently changed. The decision came almost 1,000 days into the full-scale war in Ukraine, and with Mr. Biden about two months away from handing over the White House keys to President-elect\u00a0Trump, who's seen as far less supportive of Ukraine's ambitions of hanging onto all of its Russian-occupied territory.",
      "It also came as Russia hit Ukraine with a devastating missile attack, highlighting Ukraine's desperate desire for the ability to target Russian weapons systems deeper inside the country before they're launched, which Zelenskyy has stressed for more than a year.",
      "Many of the Russian rockets launched Sunday targeted energy infrastructure but a ballistic missile carrying cluster munitions also struck a residential part of the northern city of Sumy, killing 11 people, including two children, and leaving more than 80 others wounded. Fresh strikes hit apartment buildings in the southern city of Odesa on Monday, killing at least eight people including a child, regional authorities said.",
      "Residents in Sumy were targeted as they slept, and Ukrainian officials called the Sunday missile and drone salvo one of the largest Russian attacks since the start of the war.",
      "With the change in policy from the outgoing administration in Washington, Ukrainian forces will be able to retaliate harder, reaching further into Russia than ever before. Ukrainian forces have launched drone attacks into Russian territory, including targeting Moscow, for months, but with limited effect.",
      "Zelenskyy welcomed the change in U.S. policy, saying \"strikes are not made with words\u2026 The missiles will speak for themselves.\"",
      "But Ukraine's war-time leader also appeared to acknowledge the change in tack in Washington that Trump's second swearing-in will bring, with a far greater emphasis expected on striking a negotiated truce than on defending Ukraine's sovereign territory from unilateral annexation by Russia.",
      "\"It is certain that the war will end sooner with the policies of the team that will now lead the White House. This is their approach, their promise to their citizens,\" Zelenskyy said in an interview with a Ukrainian news outlet, adding that Ukraine \"must do everything so that this war ends next year, ends through diplomatic means.\"",
      "In Moscow, meanwhile, senior lawmaker Leonid Slutsky slammed Mr. Biden, accusing him of deciding \"to end his presidential term and go down in history as 'Bloody Joe'.\"",
      "Senator Vladimir Dzhabarov, meanwhile, told Russia's state-run Tass news agency that Biden's decision represented \"a very big step toward the beginning of the third world war.\"",
      "The official newspaper of the Russian state, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, warned \"the madmen who are drawing NATO into a direct conflict with our country may soon be in great pain.\"",
      "Putin had personally warned against the eventuality previously, issuing a warning in September that U.S. permission for Ukraine to fire American-supplied long-range missiles at his country, \"would mean that NATO countries, the United States, and European countries, are parties to the war in Ukraine.\"",
      "But Putin himself has dramatically raised the stakes in the war since then, by overseeing the deployment of at least 11,000 North Korean troops to fight alongside Russian forces. They've joined the battle in Russia's western Kursk region, a significant portion of which Ukrainian troops occupied earlier this year in a surprise offensive.",
      "According to John Sullivan, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Russia under both Trump and Mr. Biden, it may have been that move by Putin \u2014 \"really solidifying this as a global conflict with troops from North Korea fighting in Europe\" \u2014 that proved to be \"the last straw\" for the current U.S. president.",
      "\"It's been one escalation after another by Putin and, in my opinion, it was about time that the United States gave the Ukrainians the ability to defend themselves more completely,\" Sullivan said Monday on CBS Mornings.",
      "The parameters of the permission granted to Ukraine for the use of the ATACMS haven't been confirmed, but according to reports, they include \u2014 and may be limited to \u2014 Ukraine using the missiles to attack Russian defensive positions in Kursk.",
      "James Nixey, who heads the Russia and Eurasia program at the London-based Chatham House think tank, said in an analysis Monday that the change in policy from Washington was \"not a game changer,\" especially if it included a limitation on where Ukraine can use the ATACMS.",
      "\"The relaxation of range limits for Ukraine's usage of US ATACMS follows the overall pattern of America's approach to this war: to make sure Ukraine cannot inflict significant damage on Russia\u2026 but to allow small increases in hardware provision and their usage over extended periods of time,\" he said. \"If it is true that the authorization for usage extends only to the Kursk region (and is therefore primarily directed at North Korean troops); then, again, this fits the pattern, and means the overall effects on the war will be negligible.\"",

      "Shklyarov was a star dancer at the Mariinsky, the historic opera and ballet venue in Russia's imperial capital of Saint Petersburg. His funeral will be held on Thursday, the Mariinsky Theatre announced.",
      "Citing theater representatives, Russian media reported that he fell from a fifth-floor balcony on Saturday after taking painkillers ahead of back surgery that had been scheduled for Monday.",
      "\"His loss is deeply felt by the entire Mariinsky family and the wider ballet world,\" the theater said Monday in a statement, without commenting on the circumstances of Shklyarov's death.",
      "Shklyarov had been a principal dancer with the theater since 2011, \"captivating audiences with his expressive artistry and technical brilliance,\" it said.",
      "He was married to fellow company dancer Maria Shklyarov, with whom he had two children, CBS News' partner network BBC News\u00a0reported.",

    "summary": "The sister of Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, an American activist killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, says her idealistic vision of the U.S. has been shattered.",
    "story": [
      "More than two months after American activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi was killed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, allegedly by a member of Israel's security forces, her family tells CBS News their faith in the United States has been shattered due to the lack of any independent criminal investigation.",
      "Eygi's husband Hamid Ali said he was appalled by the reaction of the Biden administration.",
      "\"I would hope that the U.S. government is able to implement its own law in this case and withhold, at the very least, funding from its own taxpayers that went to this unit or this soldier that killed one of its own citizens,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Neither the Biden administration nor any U.S. law enforcement agency has announced an investigation into Eygi's killing. The State Department told CBS News it continues pushing to see the results of a \"full, transparent\" Israeli probe.",
      "Eygi's sister, \u00d6zden Bennett, said the Biden administration's response had made the grieving process \"even more heartbreaking and painful.\"",
      "\"No family should have to experience this,\" she told CBS News, with tears in her eyes.",
      "Bennett said that growing up in the U.S., she had developed an idealistic vision of the country and its values but her sister's death \"shattered\" those ideas.",
      "\"It feels like they don't care about all U.S. citizens the same way,\" she said. \"The U.S. government, or the Biden administration particularly, not opening an investigation makes us question why it is not being equally treated.\"",
      "Witnesses, her family, and the group Eygi had joined at a protest have said the U.S.-Turkish dual national was shot in the head by an Israeli sniper as she stood under a tree in the West Bank city of Nablus.",
      "She was shot not long after joining a protest organized by the International Solidarity Movement, at which the Israel Defense Forces said some demonstrators had thrown projectiles at troops. Witnesses said she was shot after the protest, and away from where it had taken place.",
      "The IDF said an initial inquiry found it was \"highly likely that she was hit indirectly and unintentionally\" by a member of the Israeli security forces. The IDF told CBS News on Thursday that it was unable to provide any further detail on its ongoing investigation.",
      "A State Department spokesperson told CBS News last week that the U.S. has continued to press Israel for \"a full, transparent, and rapid investigation.\"",
      "\"We are eager to see the findings as soon as possible, including any appropriate accountability measures that will be taken,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Asked whether the U.S. government intended to launch its own criminal investigation into Eygi's killing, the White House referred CBS News back to President Biden's statement from September, in which he said Israel had \"acknowledged its responsibility for Aysenur's death,\" and that the U.S. had \"full access to Israel's preliminary investigation, and expects continued access as the investigation continues, so that we can have confidence in the result.\"",
      "But Eygi's father, Mehmet Suat Eygi, said it seemed to have become the norm for the U.S. government to downplay the killing of Americans by Israeli forces. He said his daughter's death reminded him of the deaths of other U.S. nationals in the Palestinian territories, particularly Rachel Corrie and Shireen Abu Akleh.",
      "\"It's beyond disappointment,\" the bereaved father told CBS News. \"The reaction of the U.S. government only asserts that Israel could kill anyone and there would be no consequences.\"",
      "He emigrated to the Seattle area in 1999, when his daughter was 10 months old, and was naturalized in 2005. Aysenur Eygi grew up in the Pacific Northwest and graduated from the University of Washington in the spring of 2024. She had planned to start a PhD program after taking a gap year off.",
      "\"The safety of American citizens should not be tied to their ideological support to Israel,\" Eygi's father told CBS News.",
      "Samah Park Imtiaz was a close friend of Eygi. Sobbing quietly, she recalled to CBS News their last phone call, when Eygi told her how much she missed her cat.",
      "\"I am still in a dream state when I think about what happened,\" Imtiaz said. \"[Biden] said whoever hurt Americans would face consequences. We are Americans and we deserve answers.\"",
      "In September, 103 members of the U.S. Congress signed a letter to Mr. Biden urging the administration to launch an independent investigation into Eygi's killing.",
      "\"To walk away without asking further questions gives Israeli forces unacceptable license to act with impunity,\" the lawmakers said.",
      "Brad Parker, a member of the legal team supporting Eygi's family, called the Biden administration's response thus far \"underwhelming,\" and said it was \"concerning\" that there had not been a \"strong sign to pursue justice for Aysenur.\"",
      "\"I think it's the policy at this point, which can be characterized as providing impunity to Israeli forces, even in the killing of American citizens,\" he told CBS News. \"The focus has been on having the Israeli military adjust [its] rules of engagement, rather than justice and accountability for specific killings of American citizens.\"",
      "Eygi's husband, Ali, said Israel's close alliance with the U.S. should not make it immune to consequences.",
      "\"Israel has a history of not being forthcoming with any kind of investigation and, when they are, it is largely inadequate what they come up with,\" he said.",
      "His sister-in-law said the Biden administration had yet to address the family's pain, \"aside from condolences.\"",
      "\"If the U.S. government does not respond to cases like hers, which historically they have not, Israel has the green light to continue acting with impunity and killing other citizens,\" Bennett asserted.",

    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 After more than a year of bombing and homelessness, Gazans are looking to a new administration in Washington for help. President-elect Donald Trump's election victory has raised hopes and fears among the five million residents of the Palestinian territories \u2014 the war-torn Gaza Strip and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.",
      "Gaza resident Rakan Abdul Ahman told CBS News he wants the new U.S. president to make Israel end the war.",
      "\"We've witnessed enough killing of women and children,\" he said. \"I'm looking for Trump to end the suffering in the Gaza Strip.\"",
      "In the eyes of Ahmed Harb, a Gazan journalist, the incoming Trump administration faces a real test. In his victory speech, Trump said he'd end wars. Harb hopes that means the one in Gaza.",
      "\"I hope he was telling the truth,\" he told CBS News, adding: \"But he shouldn't stop the war at the expense of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "That is the big worry for Palestinian politicians, too, including Mustafa Barghouti. Still a practicing physician, he leads the Palestinian National Initiative, a party that champions democratic government for all Palestinians in both the West Bank and Gaza.",
      "The question, Barghouti said, is \"how you stop the war? Do you stop it by annexing occupied territories? By ethnically cleansing Palestinians? Or do you stop the war by forcing Israel to end its illegal policy of settling Israelis on our land?\"",
      "Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza, sparked by the U.S. and Israeli-designated terrorist group's massacre of some 1,200 people on Oct. 7, 2023, has diverted international attention away from growing violence in the West Bank by Israeli settlers determined to encroach on what has been Palestinian land.",
      "In 2023, there were a record number of so-called outposts \u2014 makeshift Jewish encampments set up by settlers in what has been Palestinian land. They can be as simple as a couple of shipping containers that function as a de-facto Jewish real estate claim. The settler groups then lobby Israel's courts and government to retroactively make the outposts official Jewish settlements.",
      "Right-wingers in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet support Jewish expansion, including the outposts, in the West Bank. They openly advocate driving the Palestinians out, and annexing the whole area for Israel. Not only would that be illegal under international law, Barghouti warns that it would also lead to even more conflict.",
      "\"We will struggle for our rights,\" he said. \"It will take time. We will suffer. We know that. But what's the alternative? To cease to exist? It's ethnic cleansing. We cannot accept that.\"",
      "Palestinians everywhere are watching Trump's choosing of pro-Israeli officials for key positions with dismay, especially Mike Huckabee, the president-elect's pick to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Israel.",
      "Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, is on the record as saying, \"there's really no such thing as a Palestinian.\"",
      "\"When you hear a person like Huckabee saying there is no occupation, and there are no settlements, they are just Israeli communities\u2026. he might as well say there is no international law,\" said Barghouti.",
      "During Trump's first term, he opposed the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and, in 2020, proposed what he called \"the deal of the century\" \u2014 a template for a long-sought Palestinian state.",
      "Under his proposal, the new state would have been a scattering of isolated Palestinian lands, each surrounded by Israel. The plan was rejected by both the Palestinians and by Jewish settlers and, since then, both sides have dug in.",
      "Even if the new Trump administration revives some version of its proposal for a Palestinian state, it will face Palestinians and their Arab allies whose resolve has only been hardened by a devastating year of war in Gaza that has killed almost 44,000 people.",
      "On the Israeli side, hardliners in Netanyahu's government oppose any form of Palestinian sovereignty. Netanyahu himself has flatly rejected the prospect repeatedly.",
      "Barghouti, however, sounded ready for the fight.",

    "summary": "Bernadett \"Betty\" Szabo, 19, was stabbed multiple times just months after giving birth to a baby boy.",
    "story": [
      "By a canal in Amsterdam's red-light district, one of the \"window women\" is actually a hologram which Dutch police hope will help solve the gruesome murder of a sex worker in 2009.",
      "Peering through a frame out onto passers-by, a human-sized likeness of Bernadett \"Betty\" Szabo -- in skimpy shorts and a leopard-print bra, a dragon tattoo covering much of her torso -- taps the pane and fogs the glass with her breath.",
      "The word \"HELP\" appears, chillingly, on the screen.",
      "\"Fifteen years ago, Betty was killed in a horrible way and the investigation was never closed,\" Amsterdam police spokesman Olav Brink told AFP.",
      "Aged only 19, Hungarian-born Betty was stabbed multiple times in her brothel room in the centuries-old red-light district, known as De Wallen, just months after giving birth to a baby boy.",
      "Despite a large-scale police probe, the case went cold.",
      "During a review, however, police found \"promising clues\" and decided to reopen the investigation, Brink said.",
      "They hope the likeness of Betty, created with 3D visualization technology, will jolt the memories of people who may have information about her murder.",
      "\"Betty was murdered in one of the busiest areas in Amsterdam, maybe even in the Netherlands. It is really almost impossible that there are no people who saw or heard something unusual at the time,\" cold case team member Anne Dreijer-Heemskerk said in a statement. \"We hope witnesses who may have been afraid before or kept silent for other reasons now have the courage to come forward.\"",
      "Waiting for the \"golden tip\"",
      "\"There are still people who know what has happened to Betty,\" said Brink, hoping that 15 years on, \"people feel freer to share information with the police.\"",
      "The initiative also aims to raise awareness about the violence faced by sex workers.",
      "Around 78 percent of prostitutes in the Netherlands have faced sexual violence and 60 percent report being physically attacked, according to a 2018 report by Dutch charities and sex worker rights groups.",
      "Concerns about violence also rose during the Covid-19 pandemic, when loss of income forced some prostitutes to continue working illegally and reduced their ability to report crimes to the police.",
      "In the week since the hologram and accompanying information about Betty went on display, the police have seen \"that a lot of people are talking about it.\"",
      "\"We find it quite special that Betty can bring attention to her case this way,\" said Brink.",
      "In the streets of De Wallen, lined with women watching from red-lit window booths, groups of locals and visitors pause and strike up conversations about the unusual display, entitled \"Who was Betty?\"",
      "Theo, 80, who lives outside Amsterdam, said he read about the project in the papers and \"came especially to see it\" when he was in the city.",
      "Soyoon Jun, 34, lives near the red-light district, \"so it was more shocking for me that there were neighbors who are going through this type of horrendous event.\"",
      "For Jun, who works at a Christian charity, the hologram made the murder \"real.\"",
      "\"It wasn't just information that was given out,\" Jun explained. \"People could feel the helplessness that Betty would have felt.\"",
      "The police have already \"received several tips because of the campaign,\" Brink confirmed to AFP.",
      "They are still waiting, though, for the \"golden tip\" that will lead them to the murderer, which comes with a 30,000-euro ($31,600) reward.",
      "\"Special way of getting attention\"",
      "According to Brink, the hologram is a \"special way of getting attention for this case\" -- including by putting it in De Wallen, which is \"one of the busiest places in Amsterdam and probably the whole of the Netherlands.\"",
      "This may not last, though, since Amsterdam's sex workers may soon lose the centrality and visibility of their windows.",
      "The local government plans to relocate the red-light district to a purpose-built centere south of the city in the hope of reducing petty crime and tourist footfall in De Wallen.",
      "The move is opposed by tens of thousands of locals and sex workers, who are calling instead for better crowd control and surveillance in the existing red-light area.",
      "Miranda K, a 57-year-old who lives near Amsterdam and declined to give her full surname, said the relocation plan was a \"pity\" because she felt \"safe\" in De Wallen.",
      "She said the out-of-city center would be in a \"dark\" area, whereas De Wallen has \"tourists and people and locals and everything here. So I think it's safer.\"",
      "\"For me, it's not just about finding Betty or who was Betty,\" she said, \"but it's about... these other ladies on the streets too.\"",
      "Ongoing effort to identify cold case victims across Europe",
      "The search for Betty comes amid a wider effort to solve cold cases in the Netherlands and beyond. Last month, Interpol launched a new campaign to identify 46 women whose remains have been found across Europe in unsolved cases, some dating back decades.",
      "The initiative from the Lyon-based organization builds on the success of the first Identify Me campaign, which last year helped identify the body of a woman\u00a0 -- dubbed the\u00a0\"woman with the flower tattoo\" -- found murdered 31 years ago in a Belgian river as Briton Rita Roberts.",
      "The original initiative\u00a0launched to identify 22 deceased women\u00a0saw some 1,800 tips received from the public.",
      "Now the\u00a0campaign has been expanded\u00a0to include cold cases from Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands, as well as unexplained deaths from new participating countries France, Italy, and Spain.",
      "Most of the women were \"murdered or had died in suspicious or unexplained circumstances,\" the organization said.",
      "Among the women Interpol is seeking to identify is the body of a woman -- dubbed \"the woman in the suitcase\" -- with an estimated age of between 16 and 22. In the autumn of 2005, her corpse was found in a red suitcase lying in the canal in the town of Schiedam in the west of the Netherlands.",

Democratic-led election boards, however \u2014 including in Philadelphia, Bucks County, Montgomery County, and Centre County \u2014 bucked the state high court's ruling and voted to include such ballots in the recount.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says the National Security Agency advises weekly phone reboots to protect against cyberattacks and enhance mobile security.",
      "The telecom industry is one of cybercriminals' favorite targets, likely because of the sensitive data it stores. Your carrier knows who you call and what you text. This type of information is valuable not only to hackers but also to governments. That\u2019s probably why U.S. phone giant T-Mobile was hacked as part of a broad cyberattack on domestic and international phone and internet companies in recent months.",

      "T-Mobile booth (T-Mobile) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "There was unauthorized access to a limited number of T-Mobile routers using methods indicative of a major Chinese cyber-espionage operation, but T-Mobile\u2019s layered defenses and security monitoring enabled T-Mobile to quickly identify and shut down the threat.",
      "The report revealed that hackers connected to a Chinese intelligence agency breached T-Mobile as part of a monthslong effort to spy on the cellphone communications of high-value intelligence targets. The report did not specify when the attack occurred, but T-Mobile says no customer calls or communication records were stolen.",
      "The U.S. government also\u00a0confirmed this month that Chinese hackers breached multiple U.S. telecommunications service providers to access wiretap systems used by law enforcement for surveillance of Americans. Wiretap systems allow law enforcement agencies to monitor phone calls, text messages and internet communications as part of investigations, typically with a warrant.",
      "CISA (Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency) and the FBI issued a joint statement revealing \"a broad and significant\" cyber-espionage campaign. The statement disclosed that PRC-affiliated hackers had breached networks at \"multiple telecommunications companies\" across the United States. While CISA and the FBI did not name the organizations affected, multiple reports suggest that T-Mobile, AT&T, Lumen (formerly CenturyLink) and Verizon are likely on the list.",
      "WSJ reported in October that Chinese hackers had access to the networks \"for months or longer,\" enabling them to collect \"internet traffic from internet service providers that count businesses large and small and millions of Americans as their customers.\"",

      "T-Mobile has faced several hacks in recent years. In 2021, a malicious actor breached T-Mobile\u2019s lab environment by posing as a legitimate connection to an unidentified piece of equipment. The hacker guessed passwords for multiple servers and moved laterally through the network, ultimately stealing personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license IDs, from tens of millions of customers.",
      "In 2022, T-Mobile experienced another breach when a malicious actor used SIM-swapping, phishing and other tactics to infiltrate the company\u2019s internal platform for managing mobile resellers who serve T-Mobile customers.",
      "The troubles continued into 2023. Early in the year, hackers used phished credentials from dozens of T-Mobile retail employees to access a sales application originally set up during the COVID-19 pandemic for remote viewing of customer data. Then, in January 2023, a misconfigured application programming interface exposed personal data for 37 million current customers, marking yet another significant security lapse.",

      "T-Mobile\u2019s response",
      "When CyberGuy reached out to T-Mobile regarding the latest security incident, a spokesperson provided the following statement: \"T-Mobile is closely monitoring this industry-wide attack. Due to our security controls, network structure and diligent monitoring and response we have seen no significant impacts to T-Mobile systems or data. We have no evidence of access or exfiltration of any customer or other sensitive information as other companies may have experienced. We will continue to monitor this closely, working with industry peers and the relevant authorities.\"",
      "WHAT TO DO IF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT IS HACKED",
      "5 ways to stay safe amid the rise in telecom data breaches",
      "1) Change your passwords regularly: Make it a habit to update your passwords every few months, especially for your telecom accounts and related services. Use strong, unique passwords that include a mix of letters, numbers and symbols.\u00a0Password managers can help you generate and store these securely.",
      "2) Invest in personal data removal services: Consider services that scrub your personal information from public databases. This reduces the chances of your data being exploited in phishing or other cyberattacks after a breach.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Use identity theft protection: Identity theft protection services monitor your accounts for unusual activity, alert you to potential threats and can even assist in resolving issues if your data is compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your telecom accounts with\u00a02FA. This requires a second form of verification, like a text code or an app-based prompt, making it harder for hackers to access your accounts even if they have your password.",
      "5) Guard against phishing scams with strong antivirus software: Be cautious about unsolicited calls, texts or emails that ask for personal information or account access. Legitimate companies won't ask for sensitive details this way. If something seems off, contact your telecom provider directly through official channels. Whatever you do, don't click on links, as they can lead to scams or malware.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Telecom providers like T-Mobile and AT&T are frequent targets for hackers. Over the last two years, millions of Americans have had their data stolen, things like call records, text messages and even personal details. The issue got so bad that the FCC stepped in, warning T-Mobile to step up its cybersecurity efforts. The company was fined about $30 million, split between a $15 million penalty and a mandatory $15 million investment in better security. Unfortunately, if the companies handling your data keep getting breached, there's only so much you can do.",

      "Many people turn to VPNs \u2014 virtual private networks \u2014 for added privacy and security online, only to find that their internet speeds suddenly slow to a crawl. But what exactly does a VPN do, and why might it cause this slowdown?",
      "A VPN works by creating a secure, encrypted pathway between your device and the internet, keeping your data private from hackers, advertisers and anyone else trying to monitor your activity. This encryption process also allows you to browse as if you\u2019re in a different location, which can help access content that may be restricted where you are.",

      "1. Disconnect from your VPN: Close your VPN application completely or turn off the VPN connection in your device settings.",
      "2. Run a speed test at Speedtest.net and note the results: Click the \"Go\" button and wait for the test to complete. Write down your download and upload speeds, as well as the ping.",
      "3. Connect to your VPN: Open your VPN application and connect to your preferred server. Wait until the connection is fully established.",
      "4. Run the speed test again: Refresh the Speedtest.net page to ensure it detects your new location, then run the test again. Note down the new results.",
      "If your VPN-connected speeds are less than about 60% of your normal speeds, then Houston, we have a VPN problem. If the difference is minimal, you may just need to optimize your base internet connection first.",

      "TOP 6 HIDDEN WAYS A VPN CAN SAVE YOU MONEY NOW",
      "Fixing VPN speed issues",
      "When encountering slow speeds while using a VPN, it's crucial to approach the problem systematically. Assuming the VPN is indeed the bottleneck in your connection, there are several steps you can employ to potentially boost your speeds and improve your overall experience.",
      "The physical distance between you and the VPN server location plays a significant role in connection speeds. Opting for a server closer to your geographical location can often result in a noticeable improvement. If you need to connect to a specific country for content access or other reasons, experiment with different cities within that country. Many VPN providers offer multiple server options in popular locations. Additionally, some VPNs display server load information, which can be incredibly useful. Connecting to a less crowded server typically yields faster speeds, as you're sharing fewer resources with other users.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE U.S. NEWS",
      "Various server locations available on VPN. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Adjusting your VPN settings can lead to performance enhancements. If your VPN service allows for customization, consider lowering the encryption level from 256-bit to 128-bit AES. While 256-bit encryption is incredibly secure, it can sometimes impact speed. The 128-bit AES encryption is still considered very secure for most purposes and may offer a speed boost. Another setting to look for is the WireGuard protocol. If your VPN provider offers this newer protocol, enabling it could significantly improve your connection speed, as it's designed to be both faster and more efficient than older protocols. For those using the OpenVPN protocol, switching from TCP to UDP can often result in faster speeds. However, approach these changes cautiously, especially if you're not entirely sure about their implications. Avoid disabling critical security features in your quest for speed.",
      "Different protocols offer varying levels of speed and security. Generally, protocols like PPTP, L2TP and IKEv2 are known for their speed but may not provide the highest level of security. OpenVPN is often the default choice as it strikes a good balance between speed and security. If you decide to stick with OpenVPN, which is recommended for most users, try switching from TCP to UDP. This simple change can potentially provide a noticeable speed boost without compromising security.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Keeping your VPN application up to date is essential for ensuring optimal performance and security. VPN providers frequently release updates that not only enhance the overall functionality of their software but also address any bugs or vulnerabilities that may have been discovered. An outdated VPN app can lead to compatibility issues with your operating system, which can hinder performance and reduce connection speeds. Therefore, it is advisable to regularly check for updates within your VPN app's settings or visit the provider's official website to download the latest version. Additionally, many VPN services offer an automatic update feature, which you should enable to ensure that you are always using the most current version of the software without having to remember to do it manually.",
      "To improve your VPN speed, it is important to minimize the load on your device by closing unnecessary applications running in the background. Many applications consume bandwidth and processing power, which can significantly affect your VPN's performance. For instance, streaming services, file-sharing programs or even software that automatically updates can slow down your connection. Before connecting to your VPN, take a moment to close these apps and consider disabling any auto-sync features temporarily.\u00a0Also, restarting your device before initiating a VPN connection is also a good practice, as it clears temporary files and frees up memory, allowing for a smoother experience.",
      "If you have tried various troubleshooting methods and your current VPN service still fails to deliver satisfactory speeds, it may be time to explore other options. The market is filled with numerous VPN providers that emphasize speed and reliability, so conducting thorough research is essential. Look for services that boast a large network of servers strategically located around the world, as this can significantly enhance connection speeds. Many top-tier VPN providers offer free trials or money-back guarantees, allowing you to test their performance without any financial risk. When evaluating potential new services, consider not only their speed but also their security features, privacy policies and customer support options. By making an informed choice, you can find a VPN that meets both your speed requirements and security needs effectively.",
      "Remember, while these strategies can help optimize your VPN speed, it's important to have realistic expectations. Your base internet speed, provided by your internet service provider (ISP), will always be the ultimate limiting factor. No VPN can make your connection faster than the maximum speed your ISP provides. However, by implementing these techniques, you can ensure that you're getting the most out of your VPN connection and minimizing any unnecessary slowdowns.",

      "1. Email validation: By opening the email or engaging with the email (clicking a link or responding to it), you can validate that the email account they messaged is active. Oftentimes, scammers randomly email people whose email address they've gotten from data breaches, the dark web or data harvesting.",
      "2. Information gathering: If you reply to the email or use any other contact information they provide to \"reinstate\" your account, it will validate that the email address they reached out to is active, and they will likely hard-sell you for financial and personal information. If you call any phone number they provide you, they will also connect your phone number with your email address so they can continue to update their information on you.",
      "3. Malware distribution: They will often have buttons, links or attachments included in the email. If you click the attachment, it can download malware or a virus to your device. If you click on a link that's provided in the email, it might take you to a website that will collect your personal and financial information or download malware or viruses to your device.",

      "The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) approved New York Gov. Kathy Hochul\u2019s congestion pricing program for Midtown and Lower Manhattan on Monday, in a 12-1 vote.",
      "Congestion pricing would commence in January, and institute a video-enforced toll on newly-built gantries surrounding the city\u2019s core. Traffic moving below 60th Street and Central Park, and entering from New Jersey, Brooklyn or Queens \u2014 except for via the RFK Triboro Bridge and George Washington Bridge \u2014 would be subject to the toll.",
      "Hochul previously said she would like to see a slightly lower price point than the original $15 \u2014 around $9, citing inflation \u2014 and MTA Chairman Janno Lieber suggested last week that he was open to seeing whether a lower toll could achieve the same revenue goals.",

      "Lieber called the return of congestion pricing \"huge for the MTA,\" arguing that those who utilize public transit or drive into the city, as well as businesses, would benefit from the plan because it will reduce traffic.",
      "\"It\u2019s a hopeful moment for drivers as well as for transit riders and for everybody, because life can and should get a lot better if you have to drive to New York, if you elect to drive to New York, if you\u2019re not spending as much time in congestion,\" he said. \"If you can save 10, 20 or even 30 minutes, your time is money.\"",

      "As for the money, Lieber told reporters after the vote that the approved $9 toll will still allow the MTA to generate $15 billion to put toward capital projects, though it may take a little longer than expected from a $15 toll.",
      "But with Hochul\u2019s full endorsement, he explained, the MTA has the certainty that it will be fully funded for projects. Lieber added that there will not be significant delays in completing major capital projects on the transit system.",

    "summary": "Following Trump\u2019s victory, the Mexican government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, is considering reassessing some of its policies to navigate the anticipated challenges.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News' Brooke Singman reports the latest on the president-elect's Cabinet picks.",
      "Mexico City - President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration is considering adjusting certain policies in response to the anticipated challenges posed by President-elect Trump\u2019s return to office, seeking to safeguard Mexico\u2019s economic interests and manage immigration effectively.",
      "Fearing that measures from the coming Trump administration might be harmful to Mexico, Sheinbaum and other officials have expressed a commitment to maintaining a positive bilateral relationship while emphasizing Mexico\u2019s sovereignty. At a recent press conference, she reassured Mexicans that there is \"no reason for concern\" regarding the election outcome, indicating confidence in the stability of bilateral relations. \"We will work with dialogue and respect for our sovereignties,\" she said.",
      "Rodrigo Montes de Oca, a scholar at the Baker Institute Center for the U.S. and Mexico, talked to Fox News Digital and said that \"the bilateral relationship will no longer be reduced to a single issue but will be addressed in a broader manner.\" He explained that \"former President L\u00f3pez Obrador \u2013 AMLO, was very skillful in being able to concentrate the entire bilateral relationship on a single issue: immigration.",
      "MIGRANT CENTER LEADER HOPES TRUMP DOESN'T BRING BACK 'REMAIN IN MEXICO'",
      "He continued, \"If AMLO cooperated on immigration, the Biden administration turned the other way on important issues such as security and fentanyl trafficking and all the antidemocratic policies that Mexico was and is promoting. Now with the coming Trump administration, everything is going to be much more complex because they will not only focus on immigration but also on trade and security. That is why Trump went so far as to say during the campaign that if Mexico did not cooperate on these issues, he would make public the U.S. government's intelligence information on politicians in Mexico who are related to drug cartels. The relationship is going to be approached in a more comprehensive way. I don't see that the Mexican government is preparing for that.\"",
      "With Trump\u2019s plans for mass deportations and more immigration controls, Mexico is expected to strengthen its immigration policies. This may involve increased enforcement at its southern border and expanded cooperation with U.S. authorities to manage migration flows effectively. Such measures aim to address U.S. concerns while upholding Mexico\u2019s sovereignty and humanitarian commitments.",
      "Sheinbaum has continued Mexico\u2019s existing strategies to manage and discourage migrant caravans traveling toward the United States. These measures include the deployment of the National Guard and other security forces to intercept and disperse migrant groups at the southern border. This approach aims to prevent large caravans from forming and progressing northward.",

      "Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on Mexican exports, particularly in the automotive sector, have prompted Mexico to consider reciprocal measures. Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard indicated that Mexico might impose its own tariffs on U.S. imports if such U.S. tariffs are enacted, emphasizing the potential economic repercussions for both nations.",
      "Montes de Oca told Fox News Digital that \"Mexico needs to prepare a comprehensive plan to address the current violence in the country; otherwise, it may face economic repercussions that could affect the renegotiation of the USMCA trade deal in 2026.\"\u00a0 In response to Trump\u2019s previous threats of military action against drug cartels, Mexico might enhance its security strategies to mitigate the risk of unilateral U.S. interventions, which the Mexican government fears.",

      "The president of the Mexican Senate, Gerardo Fern\u00e1ndez Noro\u00f1a, said, \"Donald Trump is a difficult guy, but he does not eat fire, he knows very well the importance of the relationship with our country, he knows very well the importance of the Mexican community in the United States and that he had very important support from Mexicans during the election.\" He added, \"Claudia Sheinbaum has the ability, firmness, character, preparation and the popular support to get along with him correctly.\"",
      "Mexican Congressman Ra\u00fal Torres told Fox News Digital: \"Claudia Sheinbaum's administration will have to reinforce the security strategy on the southern border by deploying the National Guard and strengthening the presence of the National Migration Institute. Likewise, she must change the narrative and a new way of negotiating with the U.S. given the upcoming negotiation of the USMCA trade deal. She must put at the center an economic agenda to empower Mexicans in the United States, whose weight is increasing every day since many of them open businesses, generate jobs and voted for Donald Trump.\"",

      "Experts consider it is still early and uncertain to know the extent to which Sheinbaum\u2019s government will be open to changing certain positions and policies to benefit the relationship with the United States. Mainly in security, they predict, since her predecessor preferred to protect criminal groups instead of fighting them. She promised continuity in everything, and security policy could be the point of most tension with the coming Trump administration.",

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 21:58:16 GMT",
    "summary": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to transform America\u2019s food system, vowing to crack down on foods and ingredients he blames for many of the nation\u2019s ills, including ultra-processed foods and food additives.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has pledged to transform America\u2019s food system, vowing to crack down on foods and ingredients he blames for many of the nation\u2019s ills, including ultra-processed foods and food additives.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump has picked Kennedy to be his nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, where he would manage a sprawling department that includes 13 agencies that play major roles in the health of Americans. Among those agencies is the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Kennedy holds a number of controversial views when it comes to public health, including anti-vaccine activism. However, experts generally agree that his stances on food and nutrition are commendable.",
      "Still, he\u2019s likely to face a major hurdle: money.",
      "The FDA\u2019s food division, poised to play a significant role in Kennedy\u2019s ambitions, operates on a tight budget. Unlike the agency\u2019s drug division, which sustains itself largely through user fees charged to pharmaceutical companies when they apply for drug approval, its food division relies more heavily on funding from Congress, said Jerold Mande, a former FDA senior adviser and former deputy undersecretary for food safety at the Department of Agriculture. (Separately, Kennedy has suggested he wants to end user fees, arguing the system creates a conflict of interest.)",
      "Historically, Mande said, Congress has been reluctant to provide money to the agency\u2019s food and nutrition program.",
      "\u201cThe FDA\u2019s food program has a billion-dollar budget, and only $25 million of that goes to food nutrition and chronic disease,\u201d said Mande, now an adjunct professor at Harvard University and the CEO of Nourish Science, a food advocacy group. \u201cSo there\u2019s almost no money for it, and that is the No. 1 barrier: they don\u2019t have the budget or staff to do anything.\u201d",
      "By comparison, the food industry spends almost $14 billion a year on advertising, the majority of which promotes fast food, sugary drinks, candy and other unhealthy snacks, said Elisabetta Politi, nutrition director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center in Durham, North Carolina.",
      "The industry, she said, likely spends millions more on lobbying Congress.",
      "\u201cI think that is a striking comparison of how hard it is for consumers to make healthy choices, when the food industry is so powerful,\u201d Politi said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s ideas about food are \u201cgreat,\u201d she said, but \u201chow you do that, I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d",
      "Difficult but not impossible",
      "Marion Nestle, professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University, said that even with limited funds, it\u2019s not impossible to take on the food industry, noting Kennedy isn\u2019t the only public figure who\u2019s tackled unhealthy foods.",
      "Former first lady Michelle Obama, an advocate for healthy eating, started the Let\u2019s Move! campaign, which focused on combating childhood obesity, including through healthy eating. She also championed the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, which set new nutrition standards for school lunches, including more fruits and vegetables.",
      "Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, has called on more thorough reviews on food coming from abroad and recently compared the processed food industry to the tobacco industry.",
      "Mande said the current FDA commissioner, Robert Califf, has made food a priority during his second tenure. Califf led the restructuring of the FDA\u2019s food division in the wake of the 2022 infant formula shortage crisis, which arose after a facility was shut down due to bacterial contamination that the agency said might\u2019ve been linked to two infant deaths.",
      "Still, it\u2019s apparent that the division moves slowly. Mande said Califf has likely wanted to do more but he\u2019s not been able to \u201cmove through the bureaucracy to move on that\u201d or get the needed resources.",
      "\u201cI mean, everything RFK has been saying on chronic disease and our food and the need to do something about that, Califf has been saying that too throughout his tenure,\u201d Mande said.",
      "In July, the FDA finally banned brominated vegetable oil, a food additive primarily used in fruit-flavored sports drinks and sodas that carries potential health risks, including damage to the liver, heart and brain. That ban, however, was only proposed last year, several decades after the agency concluded that its use in foods wasn\u2019t safe.",
      "The agency is also expected to propose new front-of-package nutrition labels in the coming weeks and is working on an update to the definition of \u201chealthy,\u201d although it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019ll be able to get that done before the new administration comes in. The FDA is also reassessing the potential cancer risk of red dye No. 3, a synthetic food coloring that\u2019s already banned in California and Europe.",
      "In a statement, an FDA spokesperson said the agency\u200b\u200b \u201cintends to make a determination on Red Dye No. 3 soon.\u201d",
      "Other additives that the U.S. allows but are banned in many European countries include yellow dyes No. 5 and No. 6, and potassium bromate and azodicarbonamide,  both used in flour to make bread.",
      "In need of allies",
      "Of course, a lot of what Kennedy will be able to accomplish will depend on how he decides to shake up the public health agencies, including the FDA, Nestle said. Kennedy has threatened to eliminate \u201centire departments\u201d at the agency, including the nutrition department. He\u2019ll need people with knowledge of how to move food policy forward.",
      "Mande said Kennedy will likely need allies in the administration to accomplish his goals, particularly at the FDA and the Department of Agriculture, who can push Congress to do more. Trump hasn\u2019t yet announced the people he wants to fill those roles.",
      "To some degree, Kennedy may also have to work with the food industry, Politi said. Nestle agreed, noting that the industry has remained mostly silent amid Trump\u2019s transition to the White House.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been very, very quiet and I don\u2019t hear the cereal companies making huge statements about the artificial colors, that there\u2019s no evidence that they\u2019re harmful,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cI don\u2019t hear the fast-food industry saying anything, which is puzzling because these industries wasted not a millisecond when Michelle Obama tried to do something.\u201d",
      "It remains to be seen whether Kennedy will face pushback if and when he is confirmed.",
      "All experts agreed that the best opportunity that Kennedy has to make the most impact is the development of the 2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which will provide nutrition guidance for the next five years and the Department of Health and Human Services is responsible for overseeing. The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee is in the process of finalizing its scientific report, which will help inform the guidelines, Nestle said. However, she added, both HHS and USDA are responsible for setting the new guidelines.",
      "\u201cThe agencies write the guidelines and the agencies are going to have new secretaries,\u201d Nestle said. \u201cThe dietary guidelines could very easily reflect Kennedy\u2019s agenda.\u201d",
      "Mande said the dietary guidelines are a \u201cpolitical process.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I mentioned, the budget they have to educate the public against food advertising? There is no budget, right?\u201d he said. However, Kennedy \u201cwill pretty much have the ability to write anything he wants in those guidelines,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s powerful,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "Congress faces a Dec. 20 deadline to fund the government and avert a shutdown, with Republicans considering pushing it until President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Congress faces a Dec. 20 deadline to fund the government and avert a shutdown, and Speaker Mike Johnson says House Republicans will probably push the fight into early 2025 rather than reach a full-year funding deal this year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re running out of clock. Dec. 20 is the deadline. We\u2019re still hopeful that we might be able to get that done, but if not, we\u2019ll have a temporary measure, I think, that would go into the first part of next year and allow us the necessary time to get this done,\u201d Johnson, R-La., said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d",
      "That would extend the deadline into early in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term. By then, Republicans will have taken control of the Senate from Democrats while maintaining a narrow House majority, giving them more power over federal funding for the rest of the fiscal year.",
      "\u201cThat would be, ultimately a good move, because the country would benefit from it \u2014 because then you\u2019d have Republican control, and we\u2019d have a little more say in what those spending bills are,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut the new reform agenda begins in earnest as soon as President Donald J. Trump takes the office in January, and we have a full agenda to run.\u201d",
      "Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, which is charged with writing funding bills, said there\u2019s still no \u201ctop line\u201d agreement between the parties on how much the government should spend.",
      "He said it is likely to be pushed into January or March, with sometime in March being more likely.",
      "\u201cWe had a meeting with the speaker earlier this week. ... He doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s any way that we can finish by the end of the year,\u201d Aderholt said. \u201cI\u2019ll be very shocked if we do anything, if we get anything resolved, by the end of the year.\u201d",
      "But other Republicans disagree with that approach and prefer to finish the funding deal this year to avoid getting bogged down with it during Trump\u2019s first 100 days. That is typically the window when a president has maximum political capital, and some GOP senators would rather use that time to confirm his nominees and advance their legislative priorities, from tax cuts to border security.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather do it this year,\u201d Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., a member of the Appropriations Committee, said of a funding agreement.",
      "\u201cI would like to have a situation clear the deck so that we don\u2019t have to deal with this next year,\u201d Boozman said. \u201cWith a new administration coming in ... confirmations are going take a lot of time. So we\u2019ll have that to deal with. And then we should be actually working on the next year\u2019s appropriations.\u201d",
      "But even if they push the fight to early 2025, Republicans won\u2019t have full control over spending decisions. Government funding legislation is subject to the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, which top Republicans have promised to preserve. That means they\u2019ll have to reach a deal with Democrats, who currently control the Senate and want to pass full-year funding this year, not in 2025.",
      "\u201cThere is no reason for further delay or to impair government agencies by forcing them to operate on autopilot for months to come,\u201d Senate Appropriations Committee Chair Patty Murray, D-Wash., who will become vice chair in January, told reporters. \u201cWe should pass bipartisan, full-year spending bills before the end of the year.\u201d",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the incoming Appropriations Committee chair, told NBC News: \u201cI think we can get a deal, and I think it\u2019s really important that we let the new administration have a clean slate and not be worrying about\u201d this fiscal year\u2019s funding.",
      "Still, if GOP leaders put forward a stopgap bill (also known as a continuing resolution, or \u201cCR\u201d) rather than a full-year deal, it\u2019s likely that Democrats would accept it to prevent a shutdown.",

That is not new to this topic, by the way, it has been something that has been consistent, so we\u2019ll see what the incoming administration has to say about it and what the posture of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle is over the next few weeks.\u201d",

    "summary": "The top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee says a report on Rep. Matt Gaetz, Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, should be made public.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The top Democrat on the House Ethics Committee said Monday that the panel's report into GOP former Rep. Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s pick for attorney general, should be made public.",
      "The bipartisan Ethics Committee had been investigating Gaetz, of Florida, off and on since 2021, probing allegations of sexual misconduct involving a 17-year-old girl, illicit drug use and accepting improper gifts. But the committee lost jurisdiction over Gaetz when he resigned from the House on Thursday and has not released any public report on its probe.",
      "Rep. Susan Wild, D-Pa., the ranking member on the Ethics Committee, said its report should be released.",
      "\u201cIt absolutely should be released to the public. And, well, it should certainly be released to the Senate, and I think it should be released to the public, as we have done with many other investigative reports in the past,\" she told reporters, adding: \"There is precedent for releasing even after a member has resigned.\u201d",
      "The House Ethics Committee plans to meet Wednesday to discuss the report, a source familiar with the meeting confirmed to NBC News earlier Monday.",
      "The details of the report have not been made public. Several Republican senators, who will consider Gaetz\u2019s nomination once it is formalized next year, have said they want details of the ethics investigation \u2014\u00a0whether through access to the report itself or through an FBI background check on Gaetz.",
      "On Friday, an attorney said that his client testified privately before the Ethics Committee that she personally witnessed Gaetz have sex with a minor. Gaetz, 42, has denied all allegations.",
      "Wild said she was \"waiting to see what ... the other members of the committee are going to do, before taking any further action.\"",
      "The House Ethics panel had been scheduled to discuss the report at its regular Friday meeting but it was postponed after Gaetz resigned. CNN first reported that the committee will now meet Wednesday. A spokesman for the Ethics panel declined to comment.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is opposed to the release of the Gaetz report, telling reporters Friday he would \u201cstrongly request\u201d that the panel not make it public due to the fact that Gaetz is now a former member of Congress and the Ethics panel only has jurisdiction over sitting members.",
      "However, there is precedent for releasing ethics reports after or on the same day a lawmaker resigns from Congress. Two months after former\u00a0Rep. Bill Boner, D-Tenn., resigned in 1987, the Ethics panel released an initial staff report detailing its investigation. And on the day\u00a0former Rep. Buz Lukens, R-Ohio, resigned from the House in 1990, the committee released its report into him.",
      "Making the report public \u201cwould open Pandora\u2019s box,\u201d Johnson told reporters in the Capitol on Friday. \u201cIf it\u2019s been broken once or twice, it should not have been.\u201d",
      "Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., who chairs the House Ethics Committee, said Monday that Johnson contacted him to let him know he'd told the press he did not think the report should be released. But, Guest said, \"Mike has not tried to weigh in one way or the other. He has not tried to influence the committee. He was only reaching out to me out of courtesy because he had made a comment to the press.\"",
      "Guest confirmed that he has read the Gaetz report and said that other members have had access to view it, but he would not discuss any details of the document or whether the committee will vote Wednesday to release it.",
      "Johnson said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he has \u201cnot discussed one word about the ethics report,\u201d with Trump, despite spending time with the president-elect in recent days in Washington, at Mar-a-Lago and at a UFC event at Madison Square Garden.",
      "A number of Republican senators, including some who will have an opportunity to question Gaetz at a Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing, have said they want to see the House report.",
      "Appearing on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla., said senators should \"absolutely\" have access to the House report.",
      "\"I believe the Senate should have access to that now. ... That should be definitely part of our decision-making,\" said Mullin, who served with Gaetz in the House and has been publicly critical of the Florida Republican's character.",
      "\"Once again, I go back to Article Two, Section Two in the Constitution. The Senate has to advise and consent these individuals,\" the senator added. \"In that process, we're going to give Matt Gaetz the same chances we'll give all President Trump's nominees.\""

      "The race for Democratic Party chair has officially launched with former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, a onetime presidential candidate, announcing a bid to take the reins.",
      "O'Malley, who has faded from the national scene of late, made a brief bid in 2016 to lead the Democratic National Committee, only to withdraw his name days later.",
      "A person with knowledge of O\u2019Malley's plans said he has already connected with key party leaders who have \"expressed interest in his vision for the Democratic Party\u2019s future.\" He is expected over the next several weeks to lay out the key tenets to his vision for the party. They include communicating with Americans \"not through fear\" but terms of in providing a better future.",
      "O'Malley, who is the commissioner of the Social Security Administration, is expected to lean on his record as a mayor, a governor and the chair of the Democratic Governors Association. And he's expected to express support for a 50-state commitment, meaning the DNC would help maintain party infrastructure across the country, not just in battleground states. That's a position several contenders are expected to take.",
      "While O'Malley formally entered the fray, which was first reported by The New York Times, plenty of other names were swirling even before the Nov. 5 election. DNC Chair Jaime Harrison, who is leaving his post, is expected to make more public comments in coming weeks about how the party should move forward.",
      "One of the people most often cited in Democratic circles as a possible chair is Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler. Wikler is known as a prodigious fundraiser who gained the respect of Republicans and Democrats alike, and he has been an omnipresent cable TV voice for the left in the last several major national and local elections.",
      "\u201cBen is seriously considering a run,\u201d\u00a0a person with knowledge of Wikler\u2019s thinking told NBC News.",
      "Several DNC members privately said they were already backing Minnesota Democratic Party Chair Ken Martin. Martin hasn\u2019t formally announced he would run but is \"definitely considering it,\" he told NBC News. He said he firmly believes the party should continue building all 50 state parties.",
      "\"A lot of folks are calling me and encouraging me to run,\" Martin said. \"I would just say I've had lots of good conversations. It\u2019s a lot to consider.\"",
      "Martin is also president of the Association of State Democratic Chairs, which some supporters say could be a natural springboard.",
      "Rahm Emanuel \u2014 the U.S. ambassador to Japan and former mayor of Chicago, congressman and chief of staff to President Barack Obama \u2014 has floated his own interest in the job. He has done some outreach to DNC members, according to a person familiar with the matter.",
      "Two people close to Emanuel described his interest as somewhat tepid, also noting he may have larger prospects on the horizon. Emanuel may be open to running for public office in Illinois should longtime Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin make an announcement that could come in January or if Gov. JB Pritzker decides not to run for a third term when his is up in 2026, the two people said.",
      "Several state party chairs said any Emanuel bid would be \"dead on arrival\" or \"laughable.\"",
      "Nebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb said in an interview she opposed Emanuel and couldn\u2019t see his bid gaining traction. Kleeb is backing Martin, she said, while she is interested in seeking the Association of State Democratic Chairs chair post that Martin now holds.",
      "Whoever steers the party must pick up the pieces from a devastating loss to Donald Trump on Nov. 5. That will include helping determine where the primary calendar stands. NBC News reported Friday that there is already an appetite to revamp the calendar yet again after months of painstaking argument and planning led the party to scrap Iowa and New Hampshire from its early-state lineup."

      "Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats convinced frequent voters and highly engaged voters to stick with them in the 2024 presidential election.",
      "Their problem: They lost with most everyone else.",
      "According to the\u00a0final NBC News poll of the 2024 race, 76% of registered voters said they follow public affairs and politics closely. The poll showed Harris winning among that group by 5 points over Donald Trump, 52%-47%.",
      "But among the remaining quarter of voters who said they don\u2019t follow politics closely, Trump was ahead by a much greater margin \u2014 14 points, 54%-40%.",
      "These less-engaged voters were disproportionately younger, more Republican-leaning and less likely to have college degrees \u2014 all groups of voters the\u00a0NBC News Exit Poll\u00a0showed Democrats struggling with in the election results earlier this month, especially compared to past presidential races.",
      "After their defeat in 2024, Democratic strategists tell NBC News that the party must do a better job communicating with these less-engaged voters and prevent itself from getting trapped in a bubble.",
      "\u201cOne of the main takeaways from this cycle is that the Democratic Party has a lot of work to do on how we\u2019re reaching voters,\u201d Democratic strategist Christina Freundlich said. \u201cWe lost the persuasion game.\u201d",
      "Steve Schale, a veteran Florida-based Democratic strategist who worked on Barack Obama's presidential campaigns and for a pro-Joe Biden super PAC in the 2020 campaign, takes the criticism of his party even further.",
      "\"We don\u2019t have authentic messengers,\" he said. \"We avoid the communication channels where many of these voters get their information.",
      "\"And, fair or unfair, our brand among many of these voters is defined by the most extreme voices in our party,\" Schale continued, echoing a point recently made by Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and others.",
      "'We simply stopped communicating to many voters'",
      "Democrats overperforming with highly engaged voters \u2014 but struggling with less-engaged voters \u2014 reflects America\u2019s political realignment over the past decade, as Democrats have made gains among college-educated and more frequent voters, while Republicans have won over more working-class and\u00a0less-frequent voters.",
      "It's a dynamic that helps explain Democratic success in recent special elections and the 2022 midterms as well as why Trump and the GOP did better in the higher-turnout 2024 presidential election.",
      "Media consumption also underscores the political split between highly engaged voters and less-engaged ones. In an\u00a0NBC News poll\u00a0in April \u2014 when President Joe Biden was still in the race \u2014 Democrats overperformed among voters who get their political news from newspapers and national TV networks.",
      "But they struggled among voters who got their news from places like YouTube and Google.",
      "And that April poll showed Biden trailing Trump by nearly 30 points among voters who said they don\u2019t follow political news.",
      "The most recent NBC News poll, from November,\u00a0asked\u00a0a different question: Do you listen to podcasts to get news and information?",
      "Almost half of voters \u2014 42% \u2014 said yes, and Trump led Harris by double digits among these podcast listeners, 57%-42%.",
      "Schale, the Democratic strategist from Florida, argues that Democrats \u201csimply stopped communicating\u201d with huge swaths of voters.",
      "\"Data analytics tries to tell us things like where it is efficient or not to spend time or money, and we score voters with numbers to help maximize efficiency,\" he said. \"The problem is we simply stopped communicating to many voters because they didn\u2019t fit the model of how we got to a win.\"",
      "\"Guess what?\" Schale continued. \"It\u2019s led us to play in fewer states and talk to fewer voters. So for lower-information voters, they are relying on their own life and their perception of the brands of the parties.\"",
      "Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson, a veteran of state and national campaigns, says it would be a mistake for his party to try to win over less-engaged voters with more information.",
      "\u201cThe wrong solution for Democrats is to think that low-information voters could be persuaded by clogging them with more information,\u201d he said. \u201cThe right solution is to be clear and focused on what we\u2019re communicating.\u201d",
      "\u201cDemocrats have gotten into a habit with messages and language that makes it harder for people to follow,\u201d Ferguson added. \u201cYou can have a Ph.D., but you don\u2019t need to communicate it in a way where only Ph.D.s can understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d",
      "'You don\u2019t need to pick up a paper for that': Voters felt nation was on wrong track",
      "But Republican strategist Doug Heye believes discussing the split between highly engaged voters and less-engaged voters misses the\u00a0mark.",
      "In the 2024 election, enough voters believed prices are too high and that the country is on the wrong track to compel change, he explained.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t need the media to tell them prices are too high,\u201d Heye said. \u201cLive a normal American life and you\u2019ll probably think we\u2019re on the wrong track. You don\u2019t need to pick up a paper for that.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever weird rabbit holes Trump would go down at events \u2014 which those voters weren\u2019t paying attention to anyway \u2014 the overarching theme of his campaign was we are on the wrong track,\u201d he added. \u201cHarris seemed to either not want to talk about that or struggled with how to.\u201d"

      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the party has fully embraced, and hasn\u2019t for decades, really, working-class people,\u201d said Brent Booker, the general president of the Laborers\u2019 International Union of North America. \u201cWe have to deconstruct and reconstruct the Democratic Party if they\u2019re going to be the party of working people.\u201d",
      "Union membership has cratered over the past 50 years, so union leaders say there is only so much they can do in a world where 9 in 10 workers are not unionized and larger trends are cleaving workers from the Democratic Party.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t communicate with every nonunion laborer. We can only communicate with a portion of our members,\u201d said Booker, who thinks Democrats could have performed better with a fierier populist message on the economy and a cooler one on cultural issues that make some of his members feel like Democrats are out-of-touch elitists. \u201cA lot of our members own guns. A lot of our members hunt.\u201d",
      "Booker said that when he toured job sites this year, he heard about inflation, immigration and the demise of the Keystone Pipeline, which would have created jobs for his members but was killed for environmental concerns \u2014 all issues that played to the GOP\u2019s favor.",
      "Defining the working class is tricky in a postindustrial economy. But whether they are measured by income or educational attainment, President-elect Donald Trump won working-class voters overall while he made strong gains among nonwhite working-class voters like Hispanics and Asian Americans.",
      "As recently as 2012, non-college-educated voters were splitting their votes evenly or even slightly in favor of Democrats. This year, they broke 2-to-1 for Trump over Harris, according to NBC News exit polls. And while former President Barack Obama won 57% of people making $30,000 to $49,999 in 2012, Trump won that income bracket 53%-45% this year.",
      "As educated professionals who used to vote Republican recoiled from Trump, Democrats have become more affluent and educated. But that has left the party\u2019s leaders, donors, operatives and other decision-makers more removed from the lives of low- and middle-income workers, some labor leaders say.",
      "For instance, they say Democrats refused to acknowledge the impact of post-Covid inflation, from which higher-income professionals were more insulated, and instead tried to persuade Americans to believe abstract economic metrics over their lived experiences of painful credit card swipes at the grocery store.",
      "\u201cThey failed to address inflation, saying that it wasn\u2019t a big issue or that the pain that working people feel right now isn\u2019t real,\u201d Jimmy Williams, the president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, said on X. \u201cThe Democratic Party has continued to fail to prioritize a strong, working class message that addresses issues that really matter to workers.\u201d",
      "Trade unions like the Laborers and Painters tend to be whiter, more male and more conservative than service-sector unions. And the labor movement includes a vast range of opinions. But there is widespread frustration that Trump outflanked Democrats to position himself as a champion of working people, as well as dissatisfaction with Democrats not limited to white or male union members.",
      "\u201cThe narrative that he was able to craft was almost right out of the labor unions\u2019 playbook in terms of focusing on the economy and jobs, bringing manufacturing jobs back, getting tough on China, making sure that working families can put more money in their pocket,\u201d said Liz Schuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, the massive labor federation that includes 60 unions that together represent 12 million people.",
      "Schuler said that message, from a billionaire who has stiffed workers and fell far short on promised job creation, is bogus \u2014 \u201cHe talks a good game but never delivers\u201d \u2014 but she could not deny its power at the polls.",
      "Trump made his pitch directly to rank-and-file members, telling them to ignore union leaders \u201cwho rip-off their membership with ridiculously high dues\u201d \u2014 even if he sometimes made that case to nonunionized workers.",
      "And working-class support for Democrats is hardly a new phenomenon. But some in the party say those long-term trends have reached a crisis point.",

      "Democrats have tried to win back working-class voters with policies designed to help them, especially by supporting unions.",
      "The theory, accepted as a truism on the left, is that good policy leads to good politics and that people will reward you with their votes if you do things to make their lives better. But the results of that strategy have been disappointing.",
      "Biden went all in on unions. One of his first actions as president was an $83 billion taxpayer-funded bailout of the Teamsters pension fund. He even launched his second presidential campaign from a Teamsters hall in Pittsburgh, saying: \u201cI make no apologies. I am a union man.\u201d",
      "But the Teamsters could not return the favor. After surveys of their roughly 1.3 million rank-and-file members found that 60% supported Trump while only 34% supported Harris, Teamsters leaders decided not to endorse anyone.",
      "Most unions still backed Harris, as is typical for a Democratic presidential candidate, but the Teamsters were not the only union to break from the precedent. The International Association of Fire Fighters and the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, both of which backed Biden in 2020, and the United Mine Workers of America all sat out the race entirely.",
      "That despite Biden\u2019s embracing organized labor\u2019s policy wish list, from pro-union appointments to the National Labor Relations Board to executive actions to strengthen unions, while potentially creating millions of union jobs through massive spending on infrastructure, clean energy and semiconductors. Biden was even the first president to walk a strike picket line.",

Ray was moved to a private room in the emergency department where, over the next four hours, Hiram Bonilla, a male nurse, repeatedly sexually assaulted\u00a0her,\u00a0court and police records show.",
      "\u201cHe was putting stickers on my chest for an EKG and he said, \u2018You got pretty titties,\u2019\u201d Ray recalled in an interview with NBC News. \u201cBy the time he finished that statement, he was on me.\u201d",
      "Hospital video reviewed by NBC News shows Bonilla entered Ray\u2019s room 28 times over those\u00a0four\u00a0hours, every nine minutes on average.",
      "Heavily medicated, Ray told hospital staff what Bonilla had done, but they pooh-poohed her, she testified, with one staffer telling her Bonilla was \u201ca very good man\u201d and \u201cwould never do\u201d what she\u2019d accused him of, court records show.",
      "Ray called her longtime therapist from the hospital and told her about the incidents. The therapist then notified a local center that\u00a0helps sexual abuse victims.\u00a0At 2:15 a.m. on Jan. 6, the abuse center notified Citrus Hospital of Bonilla\u2019s alleged assaults, court documents show. It then took almost six hours for the hospital to alert police to the allegations.",
      "When a detective arrived at the hospital to interview Ray, he found the crime scene altered, he testified. Critical evidence, such as bed sheets and a pillowcase, were gone from her room.",
      "In 2022, Bonilla, 60, was found guilty of sexual assault in the incident and is serving a 20-year sentence. Ray sued the hospital for negligence, and in September a jury awarded her $25 million. About a month later, she\u00a0entered into\u00a0a confidential settlement with the hospital, her lawyer, Gregory Roe, said.",

      "Citrus Hospital is owned by HCA Healthcare,\u00a0the nation\u2019s largest hospital chain. HCA has 187 hospitals nationwide and in the U.K., and 46 in Florida alone. The company earned $4.3 billion during the first three quarters of 2024. Those results were 19% higher than the same period in 2023; HCA\u2019s stock trades at $333, up 21% year to date.",
      "Ray\u2019s repeated abuse at HCA\u2019s Citrus Hospital occurred four months after another male nurse, Mark Miskar, sexually assaulted a patient there, police records show. Miskar is currently serving a 65-month sentence for sexual battery in that incident.",
      "Katie Myers, a Citrus spokeswoman, declined to answer detailed questions about the recent assaults at the facility. She provided a statement saying that Ray experienced \u201cterrible pain\u201d in the Bonilla assault and \u201cour hearts go out to her.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have protocols designed to protect our patients and expect our employees to follow them, as well as applicable laws,\u201d Myers added.\u00a0\u201cThe heinous and criminal acts of an individual do not represent the commitment of our hospital colleagues to the care and safety of their patients.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 22:44:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Coca-Cola is facing backlash online over an artificial intelligence-made Christmas promotional video that users are calling \u201csoulless\u201d and \u201cdevoid of any actual creativity.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "Coca-Cola is facing backlash online over an artificial intelligence-made Christmas promotional video that users are calling \u201csoulless\u201d and \u201cdevoid of any actual creativity.\u201d",
      "The AI-made video features everything from big red Coca-Cola trucks driving through snowy streets to people smiling in scarves and knitted hats holding Coca-Cola bottles. The video was meant to pay homage to the company\u2019s 1995 commercial \u201cHolidays Are Coming,\u201d which featured similar imagery, but with human actors and real trucks.",
      "Forbes reported that the video was created by three AI studios \u2014 Secret Level, Silverside AI and Wild Card \u2014 using four different generative AI models. Silverside AI\u2019s AI Developer Chris Barber wrote in a reply on X that each of the AI studios created a different version of the advertisement, with the viral one not belonging to Silverside AI.",
      "The video drew criticism from many creatives who argued that it was distasteful for the company to use AI technology to create the video instead of the work of artists. Alex Hirsch, the creator of the Disney series \u201cGravity Falls,\u201d commented on an X post that showed the new commercial, which has amassed over 56 million views, \u201cFUN FACT: @CocaCola is \u2018red\u2019 because it\u2019s made from the blood of out-of-work artists! #HolidayFactz.\u201d",
      "Many artists and creative professionals have pushed back against the use of AI in creative works, arguing that the technology may be used to replace human workers and that many AI models were trained on artists\u2019 work without proper compensation or credit.",
      "In a statement, a Coca-Cola spokesperson said, \"The Coca-Cola Company has celebrated a long history of capturing the magic of the holidays in content, film, events and retail activations for decades around the globe. We are always exploring new ways to connect with consumers and experiment with different approaches. This year, we crafted films through a collaboration of human storytellers and the power of generative AI. Coca-Cola will always remain dedicated to creating the highest level of work at the intersection of human creativity and technology.\"",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time that Coca-Cola has used AI technology in its marketing strategies and programs. In March 2023, Coca-Cola collaborated with OpenAI to release one of its first AI-generated commercials, called \u201cMasterpiece,\u201d which showed paintings and sculptures in an art museum come to life and pass around a bottle of Coca-Cola.",
      "The company also announced in a news release that month that it would be partnering with artists to create artwork using Coca-Cola\u2019s creative archives and AI technology. The company even has its own global head of generative AI.",
      "Neeraj Arora, the chair of marketing research and education at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the reason why the company faced backlash for this specific advertisement, and not for \u201cMasterpiece\u201d last year, could be because many consumers recognize Christmas as an integral part of the company\u2019s brand, and AI technology acts as a disruption.",
      "\u201cYour holidays are a time of connection, time of community, time to connect with family, and that\u2019s sort of a big part of what the holidays are about,\u201d Arora said. \u201cBut then you throw AI into the mix that is not a fit, that is not a fit with holiday timing, but also, to some degree, also Coke, what the brand means to people.\u201d",
      "Toys R Us faced similar backlash online over the summer for an AI-made commercial that depicted the company\u2019s late founder in a bike shop alongside the brand mascot. Despite the controversy, the company said that it was \u201csuccessful\u201d and that the technology would be an addition to its \u201ctool kit\u201d for the future.",
      "Tim DeStefano, a research professor at Georgetown University McDonough School of Business, told NBC News that using AI technology means a significant drop in the price of creating commercials. He added that as the technology improves, he believes more people will become receptive to it.",
      "\u201cMost of the time, when we see the deployment of new technologies, you see the creation of a bunch of new jobs that never existed before,\u201d DeStefano said, addressing the focus on how AI is affecting the job market. \u201cAlthough there\u2019s some skepticism and acceptance, reluctance to accept these types of ads by consumers, I think that the benefits sort of outweigh that, and I believe that companies are going to continue using it over time.\u201d"

    "published": "Mon, 18 Nov 2024 15:53:34 GMT",
    "summary": "State-of-the-art technology has helped to create an avatar of the voice and face of Britain's Richard III over 500 years after his death in battle.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",
      "\u201cI think when people see it and hear it, then, you know, forget Richard.\u00a0Who else can we do?\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 The Ukrainian capital was blanketed by darkness Monday, even as residents were bolstered by a sense that their American allies had \u2014 finally \u2014 seen the light.",
      "President Joe Biden has authorized Kyiv to use U.S. weapons for strikes deep inside Russia, according to two U.S. officials \u2014 a major policy shift that drew a furious response from the Kremlin on Monday, accusing the administration of pouring \"oil on the fire\" two months before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.",
      "Crucially for Ukraine, the decision comes after months of pleading and just as Russia has intensified a wave of aerial attacks that forced widespread blackouts and killed more than a dozen people, according to local officials.",
      "\"It is excellent news for us and a significant move,\" Kyiv resident  Maryna Vlasenko, 39, told NBC News.",
      "She also bemoaned the lengthy process and the continued limits on Ukraine's use of the long-range weapons, however. \u201cSometimes I just have a feeling that we are receiving the bare minimum in order not to die, and with such an attitude, Ukraine will bleed to death,\u201d  Vlasenko said in an interview Monday.",
      "\u201cBut it is better to have such a decision now than not having it at all.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has for months rebuffed Kyiv's pleas to lift the restrictions on its usage of the Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, in the Kursk border region of Russia. But with Kim Jong Un sending thousands of North Korean troops to help the Kremlin's forces retake land there occupied by Ukraine, the U.S. ally will now be able to use the weapons in and around Kursk.",
      "Moscow is not just pressing on the battlefield.",
      "It has also ramped up its aerial assault against its neighbor with days of widespread attacks hitting civilian targets and critical infrastructure ahead of winter.",
      "At least 11 people, including two children, were killed in the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy on Sunday, local officials said. And 10 people were killed in the historic southern city of Odesa, local officials said Monday.",
      "Dozens more people were reported injured in the missile and drone strikes, which President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called \u201cone of the largest and most dangerous\u201d attacks of the entire war. They also hammered Ukraine\u2019s power grid, leading the state operator to announce rolling power cuts in areas across the country on the eve of the 1,000th day since Russia launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "\"The week was just awful and terrifying,\" Vlasenko said in Kyiv. \"I don\u2019t have tears to cry any more, it is pure pain. I am afraid we will stay with no electricity and water again this winter. We are exhausted.\"",
      "A battlefield boost?",
      "While the White House has not publicly confirmed the reversal, the Kremlin said that if true it would amount to a \u201cnew leap of tension and a qualitatively new situation with regard to the U.S. involvement in this conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is clear that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps, and they have talked about this, to continue to pour oil on the fire and continue to provoke further escalation of tension around this conflict,\" spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday.",
      "Russian media also blasted the move, with government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta saying Sunday that Biden had taken \u201cone of the most provocative, ill-considered decisions\" of his time in office,  \"which risks catastrophic consequences.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s nominee for national security adviser, Rep. Mike Waltz,  also appeared to raise concerns. In an interview Monday morning on \"Fox & Friends,\" the Florida congressman said: \u201cIt\u2019s another step up the escalation ladder. And nobody knows where this is going.\u201d",
      "Despite the warnings and protestations, however, analysts said it was unlikely that the U.S. decision would either provoke major escalation from the Kremlin or do significant damage to the Russian military's positions on the front lines, which have broadly been improving with each passing day.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s too little and too late,\u201d said Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to bomb Ukrainians into the dark ages,\u201d he said in an interview from Kyiv. \u201cHow much worse could it get now?\u201d",
      "Frank Ledwidge, a former British military intelligence officer, agreed.",
      "\u201cIt is unlikely that a few dozen of these flung into some tactical positions are going to tip anything,\u201d said Ledwidge, a senior lecturer in war studies at England\u2019s University of Portsmouth. \u201cThis is sort of a last hurrah from the Biden administration, perhaps even a vindictive one.\u201d",
      "Still, Ukrainians largely welcomed the news of a freer rein to make the most of U.S. help \u2014 especially given Trump's impending return and the doubts in Kyiv about his commitment to backing their fight.",
      "\u201cIt's better late than never,\u201d said Vladyslav Faraponov, head of the Institute of American Studies, a nongovernmental organization in Kyiv.\u00a0\"The decision is definitely overdue. However, that doesn\u2019t mean Ukraine won\u2019t make the best of it,\" he said.",
      "\"There are still more than two months before Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration,\" Faraponov said. \u201cUkrainians don\u2019t have the luxury of waiting while Russia continues killing civilians in Mykolaiv, Sumy, and pushing on the eastern front,\u201d he added.",

      "In a video posted on X, which Downers Grove police confirmed as being genuine and connected to the charges against Szustakiewicz, a woman lunges at someone holding a phone who is recording the incident, while a man tries to stop her. The woman takes at least one swipe at the man, and a beverage she is holding spills to the ground when the man crushes her cup to prevent her from getting at the person recording.",

      "The man is heard on the recording telling the woman, \u201cGet away from my wife.\u201d",

      "The woman then walks toward the woman holding the camera, and the man steps in between them and pushes the woman, and both the man and the woman threaten to punch each other, according to the video.",
      "The video has gotten more than 1 million views.",
      "Szustakiewicz and her relatives could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "The Chicago Office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, also known as CAIR, said in a statement the incident began because one of the victims wore a Palestinian hoodie.",
      "The male victim, whom CAIR identified as Waseem, said in the statement: \u201cI\u2019m a born and raised American who took his wife out for lunch. I was not able to do that simply because I was Palestinian.\u201d",
      "CAIR said the female victim was pregnant, and it called the behavior \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cabusive.\u201d",

      "Jose Antonio Ibarra, 26, is accused of killing Riley, 22, on the morning of Feb. 22 while she was out for a jog near the University of Georgia campus in Athens. He is charged with three counts of felony murder, malice murder, kidnapping with bodily injury, aggravated assault with intent to rape and \u201cpeeping Tom.\u201d Ibarra, whose trial began Friday, has waived his right to a jury trial, meaning a judge will determine his fate. He faces life in prison without the possibility of parole if he is convicted.",
      "Riley\u2019s death became a talking point for stricter immigration policies for Republicans, including Donald Trump, after it was determined that Ibarra was a Venezuelan citizen who entered the U.S. illegally in 2022.",
      "Prosecutors have said a variety of forensic, digital and video evidence presented during the trial will point to Ibarra as Riley\u2019s killer.",
      "The evidence includes a jacket police found in a dumpster near where Ibarra lived, which prosecutors say had both Ibarra\u2019s and Riley\u2019s blood on it.",
      "Rosbeli Flores Bello, who shared an apartment with Ibarra at the time Riley was killed, testified Monday that she told law enforcement officers when she was questioned the next day that she recognized the man shown in a video throwing a jacket into a dumpster.",
      "Flores Bello, who met Ibarra last year in New York City before they both moved to Athens,\u00a0agreed with prosecutors that it seemed \u201cstrange\u201d that the person she identified as Ibarra was throwing away a jacket she had often seen him wearing.",
      "She was also questioned about Ibarra's whereabouts on the morning Riley was killed. She said that she awoke between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and that both Ibarra and his brother Diego Ibarra were in their shared bed, seemingly asleep. Another of Ibarra's brothers, Argenis Ibarra, was also in the apartment, she testified.",
      "Law enforcement witnesses and evidence from the first two days of the trial have established that Riley\u2019s watch stopped registering heart data at 9:28 a.m. Video captured a man throwing a jacket into the dumpster at 9:44 a.m.",
      "The defense, which has called the evidence circumstantial and suggested that someone else could have killed Riley, was able to get Flores Bello to confirm that she \u201cdidn\u2019t notice anything that morning, as far as anyone leaving the apartment.\u201d",
      "In addition to Flores Bello, the prosecution called a series of law enforcement officers to the witness stand Monday, including those who first interviewed Ibarra and others who studied the evidence, including cellphone data and jail calls.",
      "James Berni, a special agent with the FBI, testified Monday afternoon that cellphone data showed that a phone linked to Ibarra was \u201cvery close\u201d to where Riley\u2019s device location data was reported at the time she was running and then killed.",
      "FBI Special Agent Jamie Hipkiss also testified about cellphone data he examined, which included photos on a phone connected to Ibarra from the early morning of Feb. 22. In the photos, Ibarra is wearing a hat, a black and white striped T-shirt and a jacket that Hipkiss said were \u201cconsistent with\u201d the clothing worn by the man in the dumpster video.",

      "\u201cHowever, in relation to the period leading up to the murder, Jose Ibarra was using that phone,\u201d he said.",
      "Hipkiss also testified that data showed that the phone was back in Ibarra\u2019s apartment and plugged in to charge at 9:58 a.m.",
      "University of Georgia Police Cpl. Rafael Sayan, who is fluent in\u00a0Spanish, testified earlier Monday that on the day after Riley\u2019s murder, when the brothers were pulled out of their apartment and questioned, \u201cthe atmosphere was very relaxed and calm\u201d and they were \u201cspeaking to one another, laughing.\u201d",

      "On Friday during opening statements, Ibarra\u2019s defense attorneys said there was not enough evidence to prove Ibarra was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.",
      "\u201cThe evidence that Jose Ibarra killed anyone is circumstantial,\u201d defense attorney Dustin Kirby said, adding that the evidence \u201cthat links Mr. Ibarra to that event is lacking\u201d upon closer inspection.",
      "Prosecutor Sheila Ross said during opening statements that Ibarra \u201cwent out hunting for females\u201d on the morning Riley was killed and that forensic evidence, including DNA and a fingerprint, would prove that he was guilty.",
      "\u201cThe evidence will show that Laken fought \u2014 she fought for her life. She fought for her dignity, and in that fight she caused this defendant to leave forensic evidence behind,\u201d Ross said."

A lesbian business owner receiving messages telling her she's been assigned to an \u201cLGB re-education camp\u201d in Las Vegas. Immigrant families afraid to report the text messages to authorities.",
      "Members of the Hispanic and LGBTQ communities are being targeted with these kinds of disturbing text messages by people hiding behind anonymous phone numbers.",
      "Soon after Donald Trump\u2019s presidential election victory, the FBI and the Department of Justice started receiving numerous reports of racist text messages being sent to Black Americans, telling them they had been selected to pick cotton \"at the nearest plantation.\" Now, authorities are investigating cases in which other groups of people are reportedly getting text messages saying they have been \"selected for deportation or to report to a re-education camp.\"",
      "Santiago Marquez, of the Latin American Association, a Latino advocacy group in Georgia, said he received phone calls on Monday morning from three concerned parents in his community who had heard about the threatening texts in the news and said their children had received the same messages. Santiago said the students who got the texts are in middle school and high school.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to panic when you get a message like that,\u201d Santiago said.",
      "The language of the text messages sent to these students were not identical, but they all referenced deportations and actions by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "According to a screenshot of one of the texts shared with NBC News,  one of the messages reads, \"You have been one of the selected immigrants that is set to be deported.\" The text continued, \"Our Executive ICE team will come and get you in a Brown Van.\"",
      "An ICE spokesperson told NBC News that these text messages are not from the agency. ICE does not send \"random text messages to people,\" the spokesperson said in a phone interview. \"Sending text messages in the blind is not how us Immigration Customs Enforcement operates. We do targeted enforcements.\"",
      "Diana Brier, a 41-year-old lesbian, received a text message on Nov. 10 telling her to check in to Nellis Air Force Base in southern Nevada on Inauguration Day for an eight-week \u201cLGB re-education camp,\u201d according to a screenshot of the message the former Las Vegas resident shared with NBC News.",
      "\u201cYour new President, Donald J. Trump, looks forward to assisting you in becoming a mentally and emotionally stable member of society by eliminating lifestyles that have been detrimental to our American way of life through re-education,\u201d the text reads. \u201cFollowing the initial eight week period, those interned in the eight week LGB camp will be eligible for release dependent upon your swearing of allegiance to your president, Donald J Trump, and your oath to live a lifestyle befitting of your Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\u201d",
      "The message adds that lesbian, gay and bisexual people must \u201creproduce birthing healthy white Christian children\u201d or be sent to transgender \u201cwork camps\u201d for two years to life. Transgender people, the text states, will be sent to work camps indefinitely.",
      "A spokesperson from Trump\u2019s transition team told NBC News in an email, \"We have absolutely nothing to do with these text messages.\"",
      "The Air Force did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Brier, who is a wine and cheese entrepreneur, said she was initially spooked by the texts. But she said she\u2019s determined to not let them weigh her down.",
      "\u201cWhen I open my business in Colorado, it will have Pride flags in the window. And if those get smashed out because I\u2019m gay, I will replace the windows, and then I will replace the Pride flags,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause wherever I go, I\u2019m just going to create a safe space for my community because it\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done, and it\u2019s what I always will do.\u201d",
      "Brier said she spoke with a Las Vegas FBI agent on Wednesday after her friend reported the text to the bureau.",
      "The agent did not know where the text came from, if other LGBTQ people in the Las Vegas-area were being targeted, or if the text originated from the same person or group targeting Blacks and Latinos, according to Brier. She said the FBI advised her to spread the word about her story to others in the LGBTQ community and encourage others to speak out.",
      "Brier said this is the first time in her life she has been harassed because of her sexuality, and, she added, she's worried it won\u2019t be the last because of Trump\u2019s return to the White House.",
      "\u201cEvery marginalized population just seems like they\u2019re going to be very embattled for quite some time,\u201d she said. \u201cI really just want the community to know that it\u2019s OK to report these.\"",
      "'Really difficult'",
      "Still, many members of Latino immigrant families who have received these kinds of messages may be hesitant to report it to authorities, said Gilda Pedraza, executive director of the\u00a0Latino Community Fund Georgia.",
      "\"I don't know that we will ever see significant reporting of these hate messages and texts because people are going to be afraid to report it,\" worried that police may assume they're undocumented, Pedraza said.",
      "Pedraza said she spoke with two families that have relatives with various types of immigration status that received the messages. For them the uncertainty feels real, considering that Trump campaigned on the promise of mass deportations.",
      "\"The overwhelming feeling is uncertainty and fear of what could be true, what could happen and how to recognize what's the difference between a threat and like a real thing,\" Pedraza said. \"It's really difficult.\"",
      "Marquez, from the advocacy group in Georgia, encouraged families who may feel afraid to say anything to start by talking to school officials or reporting what they have experienced to community leaders they trust."

      "BRENTWOOD, Calif. \u2014 A Northern California city has agreed to pay nearly $1 million to settle a lawsuit alleging police used excessive force after a K-9 dog bit into a woman\u2019s scalp during her arrest, requiring her to get more than 200 stitches and other treatment.",
      "Talmika Bates will receive $967,000 from the city of Brentwood, located about 60 miles east of San Francisco in Contra Costa County, her attorneys announced Friday.",

      "The settlement comes six months after a federal judge stripped the officer handling the police K-9 of some of his qualified immunity protection, because the extended amount of time he allowed his dog to bite bite Bates could be considered by a jury as excessive force, her attorneys said.",
      "Brentwood Police Chief Timothy Herbert said the city and its insurance providers agreed to settle the case to avoid further litigation and appeal costs.",
      "\u201cThe lone claim by Ms. Bates in this litigation was excessive force per the Fourth Amendment. In the litigation, the District Court ruled that Officer Rezentes lawfully deployed his canine in this search for the suspects, and that he had a lawful right to use his canine to apprehend Ms. Bates under the Fourth Amendment,\u201d Herbert said in a statement.",

It doesn\u2019t mean, like, I\u2019m not just losing you, you are not just losing me, we are losing our kids,'\" Powell recalled while speaking to the podcast's hosts, Lauryn Evarts Bosstick and Michael Bosstick.",

      "After Marissa Bode got the call asking her to play Nessarose in \"Wicked,\" her parents had an unexpected reaction.",
      "\"They were so happy for me for all about three minutes,\" Bode, 24, tells TODAY. \"And then they were like, 'We told you to get your passport.'\"",
      "\"Wicked\" was filmed in the United Kingdom, near London. She was offered the part in October 2022, and ideally, she would have headed to set the next day.",
      "\"Rehearsals had already started. Ethan (Slater) was already there, Ari (Grande) and Cynthia (Erivo) were already over there,\" Bode says.",
      "But there was a catch: She needed to order a passport. So after the initial excitement of getting cast wore off \u2014 a process that included leads Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo holding up a sign that read, \"Will you be our Nessarose?\" \u2014\u00a0Bode was \"terrified,\" she says.",
      "\u201cAfter everything calmed down, I was like, \u2018Hey, so, actually I don\u2019t have my passport,\u2019\u201d she recalls. \u201cI was so scared they were going to go with somebody else. But it worked out.\u201d",
      "After Bode got the document expedited, delaying her trip across the pond to film by only a few weeks, she came onto the set feeling \"nervous and anxious.\"",
      "\"When I care about something so much like this, I want to put my all into it, and I want to remind them why they chose me,\" she says.",
      "The Universal Pictures production marks Bode's film debut. (Universal Pictures is owned by TODAY.com's parent company, NBCUniversal.)",
      "The Wisconsin native grew up performing in plays through middle school and high school and attended the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Los Angeles to study acting.",
      "Before she landed the part in \"Wicked,\" Bode was working as an after-school art teacher and mentor. When the audition for Nessarose landed in her inbox, she put her all into it.",
      "She says she feels \"beyond privileged and lucky\" to have been cast in \"Wicked\" just one year after graduating college.",
      "\"When you're not represented a lot and you don't see yourself, you still have \u2014 or at least I did have \u2014 a little bit of, 'I know what I'm capable of. I know that I can act. I know other disabled talent that can act and can model,'\" she says. \"But how much of the industry is willing to go for that and is willing to seek out disabled people and willing to listen? That was the one thing that I definitely bumped into.\"",
      "Now, she's making history as the first actor who uses a wheelchair to portray Nessarose, Elphaba's sister, in \"Wicked\" throughout its more than 21-year run.",
      "Making Nessarose her own",
      "In \u201cWicked,\u201d Nessarose is the younger sister of the green witch Elphaba, who eventually becomes the Wicked Witch of the West.",
      "In the story, Nessarose uses a wheelchair due to complications from her birth, attributable to her mother eating milk flowers while pregnant to avoid having another green baby.",
      "Much of Nessarose\u2019s arc involves her asserting her independence \u2014 something Bode, who started using a wheelchair at age 11 after a car accident, can relate to. After the accident, she remembers having her parents come on class trips with her for \u201cliability purposes,\u201d a phrase she puts in quotes.",
      "\u201cI see all my other classmates be completely independent, and that was hard for me, because all I wanted was to have that independence,\u201d she says.",
      "Bode\u2019s own upbringing allowed her to empathize with Nessarose, especially her situation at the beginning of the film. In \u201cWicked,\u201d Nessarose is excited to start school at Shiz University on her own, away from her father and sister. But the sisters' father asks Elphaba to keep an eye on Nessarose, which eventually leads to Elphaba enrolling at Shiz, too.",
      "\u201cAlthough you love your family, you really do want to be on your own and to prove to yourself that you can, even though you already know that you can,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Elphaba\u2019s journey to attending Shiz University in \u201cWicked\u201d the movie is slightly different from the musical\u2019s storyline. Originally, Elphaba is enrolled at Shiz from the beginning under her father\u2019s orders to look after her sister. But in the 2024 film, the plan is for Elphaba to only be there while Nessarose gets settled in.",
      "\u201cOf course, all disabilities are different, and there are some people in wheelchairs that have a higher level of needs and higher level of caregiving. But I think this was a moment to showcase that I don\u2019t have to be dependent on somebody,\u201d Bode says.",
      "In the musical, Nessarose and Elphaba\u2019s relationship is complicated, in part, by Nessarose\u2019s resentment of Elphaba\u2019s powers, her ability to walk and the amount of attention she receives.",
      "By splitting the movies in two, \u201cWicked\u201d can slow down and explore a sweeter side to their relationship.",
      "\u201cThere were pockets of time within the film itself when Elphaba is there where I am enjoying her presence because she\u2019s my sister,\u201d Bode says of her character.",
      "Another small difference that can be seen as a big change in Nessarose\u2019s storyline is how she tells Elphaba about the invitation she receives to the Ozdust Ballroom during the sweeping mid-film number \u201cDancing Through Life.\u201d",
      "Nessarose is able to \u201cconfide in her sister about wanting to go to this dance and have that be more of a special moment for them,\u201d Bode says, \u201crather than really anxiously begging the whole time, \u2018Please, just me.\u2019\u201d",
      "Making history in and out of Oz",
      "As the first-ever physically disabled actor to play Ness, Bode brings direct experience to the character.",
      "\u201cHow I feel as a disabled person in a world that is not necessarily built for me, in a world where people just don\u2019t understand or aren\u2019t always fully educated on disability as a whole \u2014 I definitely took those with me and leaned that into my character,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Bode says she feels \u201cover the moon\u201d about the decision to cast a wheelchair user as Nessarose in the \u201cWicked\u201d film.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not something I saw a lot of when I was growing up, and if I did, it was like for one special episode and you never saw the character again,\u201d Bode says.",
      "Bode credits some of the \u201clittle things\u201d she brought to the character of Nessarose with making her performance feel authentic. For example \u2014 where and how Nessarose transported her bag.",
      "\u201cI made the adjustment of having it on the back of my chair,\u201d she says.",
      "Nessarose is also able to independently make her way around campus in the movie. \u201cThankfully, the University of Shiz is accessible,\u201d Bode says. \u201cThere are ramps everywhere.\u201d",
      "And that alone sends a message, Bode says.",
      "\u201cThere are still a number of campuses \u2014 I know because I have a number of disabled friends still going to college and even my partner who\u2019s in college \u2014 that aren\u2019t accessible,\u201d Bode says. \u201cI think that also sends a message to universities and just people as a whole as to why and how they should make their spaces more accessible.\u201d",
      "She hopes her character can help people \u201cfeel a lot less alone,\u201d especially if they haven\u2019t found their community yet.",
      "But representation is \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg,\u201d she notes.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much more when it comes to fighting for accessibility and inclusion,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I hope feeling less alone helps other disabled people and emboldens them to advocate for themselves and for others in the community.\u201d"

      "\u201cI like creating stories where people are going to feel things deeply. Writing is not just vocational. I see it as a calling,\u201d Ryan tells TODAY.com. \u201cI see my purpose for being here on Earth to write stories that crater in people\u2019s hearts. And when something has that kind of emotional impact, it lasts.\u201d",
      "\u201cReel,\u201d which was self-published by Ryan in 2021, is the first book in her \"Hollywood Renaissance\" series. It follows Broadway actor Neevah Saint and director Canon Holt as they film a biopic of fictional Harlem Renaissance entertainer Dessi Blue. During production, the two begin to fall in love and must navigate the adversities that arise when their professional and personal relationships intertwine.",
      "The book is a fan-favorite in the romance space, and in 2022, Ryan and her narrators became the first Black recipients of the romance category Audie, a prestigious award in audio publishing.",

      "The Harlem Renaissance, a period from the 1910s to mid-1930s that saw the meteoric rise of Black artistry, inspired much of \"Reel\" and the character of Dessi Blue.",
      "\u201cMy favorite people to write about are creatives, so this series is like a playground for me,\u201d Ryan says.",
      "The 1999 biopic \u201cIntroducing Dorothy Dandridge,\u201d starring Halle Berry, was the catalyst for Dessi Blue\u2019s character. Dandridge, who was an actor and singer, was the first African American woman to be nominated for best actress at the Academy Awards for her role in 1954\u2019s \u201cCarmen Jones.\u201d (Berry would go on to win the award for her role in 2001\u2019s \"Monster\u2019s Ball\" and remains the only Black woman to have done so.)",
      "Ryan notes that before that film, many people weren't familiar with Dandridge, inspiring her to explore the unsung accomplishments of Black creatives through Dessi's biopic.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how I started contextualizing \u2018Reel\u2019 as a love letter to Black creatives who, not just during the Harlem Renaissance, but throughout history, have done so much and contributed so much and not been acknowledged,\" Ryan says. \"Black music, I would hazard to say, is the most influential in culture. We wouldn\u2019t have most of the music that we have in this country without Black creatives, so I wanted to lean into that excellence.\u201d",

      "\u201c(Dessi's story) is just their real experiences fictionalized,\u201d Ryan says. \u201cEven the fact that she\u2019s bisexual. That was something that some of those women navigated during that time, and I wanted that representation as a part of her story as well.\u201d",

      "\u201cReel\u201d is just one of Ryan\u2019s many books to be picked up for distribution from a traditional publisher.",
      "\u201cYou know, a lot of people don\u2019t realize that I had a four-book series that I published traditionally. That was my debut series,\" she says.",
      "But when self-publishing was starting to flourish, Ryan, who describes herself as a go-getter, decided to try her hand at it because she wanted creative control of her work.",
      "\u201cI wanted the autonomy to build my own brand based on my values, aesthetically and just what I wanted it to be,\" she says.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re a self-published author, you do (almost) everything,\" she adds. \"You are responsible for everything. It\u2019s a business and that really tapped into something that I love.\u201d",
      "Traditional publishers were knocking on Ryan\u2019s door for years before she decided to return, she says. She knew she wanted her stories that center around Black and brown women to reach a wide audience and saw traditional publishing as a path to accomplishing that goal.",
      "\u201cI knew that the brand that I was building was centering Black and brown women very explicitly. I wanted to see them on shelves at Target. I wanted to see them at Barnes & Noble. I wanted to see them at indie bookstores. I wanted to see them on billboards,\" she says. \"These Black women with these big afros, just unapologetically gorgeous, because that\u2019s something that defies what culture tells us about ourselves. I wanted those stories to go as far as they possibly could.\"",
      "Kennedy Ryan always wants to get it right",
      "Like her character Canon in \"Reel,\" Ryan is an obsessive creative and tends to get lost in studying. She says that about 60% of her creative process is just made up of research, and when she\u2019s writing one book, she's usually reading five or six more around the same time. To make \u201cReel\u201d feel as authentic as possible, Ryan went on a deep dive on all things movie-making.",
      "\u201cI blocked off maybe a month to five weeks where I did nothing but watch MasterClasses,\" she says, referring to the online learning streaming platform. \"I just subscribed, and I watched all the greats who have MasterClasses: directors, cinematographers, writers, actors. I just consumed that world.\u201d",
      "Ryan's books often contain elements that do not come from her lived experiences. So she makes it a point to conduct thorough interviews and deep conversations with individuals who have had those experiences, she says. In addition, she says she involves sensitivity readers throughout the writing process.",
      "It\u2019s part of her personal \u201cHippocratic Oath\u201d of writing: \u201cIf you\u2019re writing a great book, but you\u2019re harming a community that\u2019s vulnerable, that\u2019s marginalized, that\u2019s not your lived experience in the process \u2014\u00a0I don\u2019t want it. That\u2019s my philosophy,\" she says.",
      "In \"Reel,\" Ryan's character Neevah lives with lupus, an autoimmune disease that involves the body\u2019s immune system attacking healthy tissue and organs. Ryan says she conducted multiple interviews with people who have lupus to develop a complete understanding of what it\u2019s like to live with the chronic disease.",
      "She also wanted to ensure women like Neevah felt seen.",
      "\u201cI wanted women who are living with chronic illness, specifically lupus, to feel beautiful, to feel loved, to feel like they weren\u2019t too much,\" she says.",
      "This is particularly highlighted in what Ryan calls \u201cthe hottest scene in the book\u201d \u2014 the bathtub scene.",
      "\u201cI wanted women who are navigating that to know you\u2019re still beautiful, you\u2019re still sexy... there\u2019s still someone who is completely drawn to you no matter what,\" she says.",
      "Having hard and honest conversations \u2013 via romance",
      "It\u2019s no secret that the romance genre has been historically looked down upon. Ryan believes animosity toward the romance genre is rooted in patriarchy and misogyny.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s rooted in the resistance of anything that centers women\u2019s pleasure, that centers our agency, that esteems our wishes, anything that is counter cultural. There is a broader cultural resistance to what we\u2019re doing,\u201d she says.",
      "Ryan also believes that people underestimate what romance is capable of. She describes her books as \u201cTrojan horses\u201d to \u201csmuggle in discourse\u201d and start difficult conversations readers may not usually have.",
      "\u201cThe reason I say that (romance) is the safest place to have hard discussions is because you know you\u2019re going to get a happily ever after. We might unpack some really hard things, but it\u2019s going to be OK in the end,\u201d she says.",
      "She says she strives for her books to be both \"trauma-informed\" and \"trauma-responsive.\"",
      "\u201cAnd what that means is there\u2019s a path that\u2019s laid for healing,\" she says. \"When you approach writing difficult circumstances that way, it\u2019s a safer space to have those discussions, and it can be really healing for readers, especially who have experienced some of those things.\u201d",
      "What\u2019s next for the Hollywood Renaissance series?",
      "Just a few months after the rerelease of \"Reel,\" Ryan will publish the third and final book in her \"Skyland\" series, \"Can't Get Enough,\" out May 2025. That series kicked off with \"Before I Let Go\" in 2022.",
      "After wrapping \"Skyland,\" Ryan says she will be focusing on the next installment in the \"Hollywood Renaissance\" series, \u201cScore.\u201d \u201cScore\u201d will be a second-chance romance that focuses on the film\u2019s music supervisor and screenwriter, Monk and Verity.",
      "\u201cIt is a book that I have wanted to write for about three years, you know? When I wrote \u2018Reel\u2019 originally, I was going to go right into writing \u2018Score,\u2019 but then I got a book deal to write the \u2018Skyland\u2019 series. So I\u2019ve been in 'Skyland' for three years, and I\u2019m really just itching to write Monk and Verity\u2019s story,\u201d Ryan says.",
      "\u201cThey have a very complex history, and I look forward to unpacking how complex and angsty it is,\" she adds.",
      "As for any adaptations on the horizon? While \"Before I Let Go\" is currently being adapted for television, she\u2019s also hoping to find a production partner who shares her vision and wants to bring \u201cReel\u201d to the big screen.",
      "\u201cWhen people ask me, \u2018Which of your books do you most want to see on screen?\u2019 I always say \u2018Reel.' It\u2019s the book that so many readers ask me for on screen,\" Ryan says. \"So I\u2019m working on it. Fingers crossed.\u201d"

      "Throughout the first half of the season, Olivia\u2019s ex-husband Horace (Ricco Ross) has been frequenting a local strip club. Though he requests private time with a female exotic dancer named Kimmie (Taylor Polidore Williams), he really has his sights set on a male dancer named Angel (Xavier Smalls).",
      "As he gets to know Kimmie and learns that her friend Rain (Amber Reign Smith) is in the hospital, he agrees to go visit her since Kimmie's pimp forbids her from seeing her. Meanwhile, Kimmie arranges for Angel to dance privately for Horace.",

      "Horace shoots the invaders before they can rob his safe and demands answers from Angel and Kimmie, since he thinks they're involved. They explain that they work for a pimp named Jules (Charles Malik Whitfield) who has forced them into sex work to repay their debts since he got them out of past legal trouble.",
      "Horace then lets them go and calls Jules, who also happens to be his security guard. He asks him about a judge he once knew, presumably the one who helped Jules get his dancers pardoned from legal charges.",
      "When Kimmie returns to her motel room, she encounters Body (Tamera Kissen), a stripper and low-level boss who works at the strip club with her.",
      "Body, who is convinced that Kimmie is trying to take her place, reveals that she's kidnapped Kimmie's teenage sister and will be making her work for her. As she sees her sister being driven away, Kimmie starts fighting Body and then runs over to her car, where she jumps in and drives it into her nemesis.",
      "Early on in the season, Body encourages Rain to get a Brazilian butt lift from a shady lady who performed Body's procedure. The surgery goes horribly wrong and Rain ends up in the hospital. When Kimmie goes to visit her one day, other patients who were in the same hall as Rain say that she died.",

He met Alex's family and asked for her father's blessing. She met his family, too. Tim called off the engagement a few days later. He said he \"didn\u2019t really appreciate\" how she handled meeting his parents, including her decision to take a nap after they left. At the reunion, Alex defended herself.

Their playful banter continued when they met in person and they pictured their life together in Mexico. After moving in, Taylor spoke about wanting to relocate to San Diego while Garrett worried about moving far away from his family.

    "summary": "State-of-the-art technology has helped to create an avatar of the voice and face of Britain's Richard III over 500 years after his death in battle.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Britain\u2019s\u00a0King Richard III\u00a0was immortalized with the Shakespeare line \u201cA horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.\u201d",
      "Now state-of-the-art technology has revealed what it may have sounded like if he did indeed utter those words just before his death in 1485 at the Battle of Bosworth.",
      "Unlike the upper-class tones of his modern successors, the re-created king's voice has a more common and earthy twang as he recites a medieval manuscript in a display that opened Sunday at the Theatre Royal in the U.K\u2019s ancient city of York.",
      "The project, which is 10 years in the making, was the brainchild of British vocal coach Yvonne Morley-Chisholm, who approached a team based at Face Lab at the U.K.'s Liverpool John Moores University and has since enlisted the help of leading specialists across a number of fields to create the avatar.",
      "\u201cThat involved dentistry, physiotherapy, the craniofacial reconstruction, the original pronunciation, forensic psychology, all sorts,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview Monday, adding that it took them \u201c10 long years\u201d to put \u201cthe pieces together in the puzzle, because we wanted this to be based on evidence.\u201d",
      "It is the latest episode in the history of the doomed monarch, who was king of England for just two years from 1483 until his death two years later at age 32.",
      "Just over 100 years later in 1592, Shakespeare vilified him as a hunchback, giving him the famous cry of despair about a horse as his last line. His body was later discovered beneath a parking lot in 2012.",
      "To help work out how Richard and his contemporaries might have sounded, Morley-Chisholm enlisted the help of professor David Crystal, a leading linguist and expert in 15th-century pronunciation.",
      "\u201cNothing like this has ever happened before,\u201d Crystal said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cThis is as close as we can get. It\u2019s 90% or so accuracy.\u201d",
      "Crystal added that he created \u201cthe sound system\u201d of the era by looking at the spelling of the words, the rhymes that were around in the poetry of the time and what Richard\u2019s contemporaries wrote about the spelling and pronunciation of English.",
      "The result, he said, \u201cis not like any modern accent at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has distinctive echoes of some modern accents, and the\u00a0predominant echo was definitely Yorkshire,\u201d he said, referring to the county in northern England known for its distinctive dialect.",
      "Richard made global headlines 12 years ago when his skeletal remains were found by British historian Philippa Langley in a parking lot in Leicester, a city around 100 miles north of the U.K.'s capital, London.",
      "CT scans of the skeleton have since helped scientists reconstruct his face and body, revealing that while he did have curvature of the spine, he was not the hunchback that Shakespeare portrayed.",
      "\u201cThe skeleton has ruled out all the myths,\u201d Morley-Chisholm said. \u201cHe did not have a limp, a withered arm, a hunchback. He was able to speak in public.\u201d",
      "\u201cWithout the discovery of his mortal remains, this project would not have been possible,\u201d she added.",
      "The skeleton also helped Morley-Chisholm find the actor that would eventually play the king\u2019s avatar.",
      "After 10 years of searching, she said she chose British actor Thomas Dennis because his face was such a good physical match. She then coached Dennis into the king\u2019s accent and personality.",
      "Langley was also involved in the project from the start, advising on Richard's character and personality by studying letters, diaries and public descriptions of the king, and looking at how that might affect the way he speaks.",
      "\u201cWhat we could then get was a probability, almost verging on certainty, of the recognized character of Richard III during his lifetime,\u201d she said in a telephone interview Monday. \u201cYou are seeing the most accurate portrayal of Richard III.\u201d",
      "Mathew Morris, a project officer at the University of Leicester's Archaeological Services, who was involved in the dig 12 years ago but not part of the avatar project, said the project was \u201ca brilliant step.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is only so much you can learn from a skeleton,\u201d he said Monday. \u201cIt is creating a resource that is allowing people to then explore less tangible facets of his life in new and innovative ways. You just don\u2019t know what it\u2019s then going to inspire.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Crystal said he was already imagining other famous faces and voices from the past being re-created.",
      "\u201cI think when people see it and hear it, then, you know, forget Richard.\u00a0Who else can we do?\u201d he said."

      "The offenders entered a farm building and \"made off with a black Isuzu pickup and a red quad bike\" before heading toward a nearby town, police said.",

      "The new authority applies to Army Tactical Missile Systems, or ATACMS, which Ukrainian officials have sought from the Biden administration.",
      "U.S. officials had resisted, citing concerns over limited stockpile, the repositioning of Russian assets outside of ATACMS range\u00a0and the fact that Ukraine has been using other assets with success, primarily drones, making ATACMS less critical to the fight.",
      "But Biden officials have condemned the North Korean deployment as a possible expansion of the war. The ATACMS could be used in and around Kursk.",
      "The Defense Department and the White House both declined to comment.",
      "Responding to a question from NBC News, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Monday that the move would represent \u201ca qualitatively new leap of tension and a qualitatively new situation with regard to the U.S. involvement in this conflict.\"",
      "Peskov pointed to comments earlier this year by Russian President Vladimir Putin during a speech in St. Petersburg, in which he suggested that Moscow could provide arms to countries to hit Western targets in response.",
      "Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, said in a statement that he is \u201cencouraged\u201d by the decision but that it \u201cdoes not excuse the administration\u2019s deliberate slow-walking of items and assistance long authorized by Congress for use against Putin\u2019s illegal aggression.\u201d",
      "Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, also applauded the decision in a statement but called it \u201coverdue.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "During a landmark visit to the Amazon rainforest on Sunday, President Joe Biden highlighted his climate legacy, declaring that no one can reverse America\u2019s green transition as President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s fossil-friendly policies loom large.",
      "Biden is the first sitting U.S. president to visit the world\u2019s largest tropical rainforest, which plays a vital role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but is under growing threat from climate change.",
      "During an aerial tour from his Marine One helicopter, Biden saw dried-up riverbeds, eroded shores and plumes of smoke from the Amazon\u2019s worst forest fires in two decades, which have burned millions of acres this year and greatly disrupted life for its Indigenous communities.",
      "Speaking afterward at the Museum of the\u00a0Amazon\u00a0in Manaus, Brazil, Biden said the fight against climate change had been a \u201cdefining cause\u201d of his presidency. He cited the Inflation Reduction Act he signed in 2022, which together with other legislation provides $450 billion in clean energy funding, he said, as well as creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and positioning the United States to cut its carbon emissions in half by 2030.",
      "Biden also said Sunday that the U.S. had surpassed his goal of delivering $11 billion per year in climate financing to developing countries by 2024, a more than six-fold increase from when Biden took over from Trump in 2021. This makes the U.S. the largest bilateral provider of climate finance in the world, the White House said.",
      "Biden began his term by bringing the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement, an international treaty on climate change that his predecessor, Trump, had withdrawn from. Trump, a climate change skeptic, has said he will withdraw from the agreement again as well as loosen restrictions on oil and gas exploration.",
      "Without mentioning Trump by name, Biden said he had left his successor and country a \u201cstrong foundation to build on, if they choose to do so.\u201d",
      "While some may seek to delay the country\u2019s green transition, \u201cnobody can reverse it, nobody,\u201d Biden said, \u201cnot when so many people, regardless of party or politics, are enjoying its benefits.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Russia unleashed its largest air strike on Ukraine in almost three months on Sunday, launching 120 missiles and 90 drones that killed at least seven people and caused severe damage to the power system, officials said.",
      "Ukrainians had been bracing for weeks for a renewed Russian attack on an already hobbled energy system, fearing long winter blackouts and mounting psychological pressure almost\u00a01,000 days\u00a0after Russia launched its\u00a0full-scale invasion.",
      "The strikes, which caused numerous power cuts, came at a time when the impending U.S. presidency of\u00a0Donald Trump, who has pledged to end the war without saying how, has raised the prospect of a push for negotiations.",
      "Air defenses could be heard engaging drones over the capital Kyiv in the night, and a series of powerful blasts boomed across the city center during the missile attack. Residents huddled in underground metro stations, wrapped in winter coats.",
      "\u201cSevere damage to Ukraine\u2019s energy system, including to DTEK power stations. These attacks again highlight Ukraine\u2019s need for additional air defense systems from our allies,\u201d said Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, Ukraine\u2019s largest private power company.",
      "The extent of the damage was hard to assess. After repeated Russian attacks on the power grid, officials reveal little detailed information about the outcome of strikes and the state of the network.",
      "Officials confirmed damage to \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d or power cuts in regions from Volyn, Rivne, Lviv in the west to Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporizhzhia in the southeast.",

      "Ukraine nervous about Western diplomacy",

      "At least seven people were killed, in the regions of Lviv, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Dnipropetrovsk, authorities said.",
      "Moldovan Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Popsoi said Russian missiles and drones had violated Moldovan airspace during the attack. NATO member Poland, which also borders Ukraine, said it had scrambled its air force as a precaution.",
      "Russia last launched a major barrage at Kyiv on Aug. 26, when officials said it had fired more than 200 drones and missiles at targets across Ukraine.",
      "Its latest onslaught piles more pressure on Ukraine as Moscow\u2019s troops notch up their fastest battlefield gains in the east since 2022 in their effort to seize the entire industrial Donbas region.",
      "Ukrainian troops are meanwhile trying to hold an area of land that they seized in Russia\u2019s Kursk region in August, something Kyiv has said could one day be a bargaining chip.",
      "Sybiha said the strike appeared to be Moscow\u2019s \u201ctrue response\u201d to leaders contacting President Vladimir Putin, an apparent swipe at\u00a0German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who called the Russian leader on Friday for the first time in two years.",
      "Though Scholz urged Putin to pull out his troops, which occupy a fifth of Ukraine, Kyiv bridled at a call that it said reduced Putin\u2019s isolation.",
      "Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk echoed Sybiha: \u201cThe attack last night, one of the biggest in this war, has proved that telephone diplomacy cannot replace real support from the whole West for Ukraine. The next weeks will be decisive, not only for the war itself, but also for our future.\u201d"
