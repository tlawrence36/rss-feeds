      "Rival studios on Sunday estimated that the Netflix film, \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d led all films in the box office this weekend with $16-18 million in ticket sales",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Netflix appears to have its first No. 1 box-office title in the streaming company\u2019s 18-year history thanks to the sensation of \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "Rival studios on Sunday estimated \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d led all films over the weekend with $16-18 million in ticket sales. Distribution executives from three studios shared their estimates for the Netflix phenomenon on condition of anonymity because the streaming company has a policy of not reporting ticket sales.",
      "Following a dominating few weeks as one of the most popular Netflix releases ever, the streamer put the film into 1,750 theaters for sing-along screenings Saturday and Sunday. Studios are able to accurately estimate ticket sales for all releases on Sunday morning, though the uncommon nature of the \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d releases means a wider variance. Some estimates were as high as $20 million.",
      "It amounted to a victory lap for \u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d arguably the biggest hit of Hollywood\u2019s summer, and an ironic success for Netflix, whose emphasis on streaming, not theatrical release, upended the movie industry. Another sore spot for Hollywood: The film was developed and produced by Sony Pictures, which sold it to Netflix.",
      "Not all exhibitors went along. AMC, the largest theater chain in North America, declined to show the movie. But that didn\u2019t stop Netflix from claiming the box-office title its more traditional competitors typically own.",
      "David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe, called it \u201ca completely unique two-day musical event.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt may turn out to be higher,\u201d said Gross. \u201cTheater owners are quick on their feet and can add capacity according to demand.\u201d",
      "The theatrical release, though limited, is out of the ordinary for the streaming giant, which has long stressed a commitment to subscriber releases. The movie debuted on the platform in late June and is currently Netflix's most-watched animated original film.",
      "The film centers on Huntr/x, a KPop superstar trio who double as demon hunters. The members, Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong) and Zooey (Ji-young Yoo), must protect their fans and face their biggest enemy yet: a rival boy band made up of demons in disguise.",
      "Zach Cregger's horror hit \u201cWeapons\u201d maintained strength in the box office during its third weekend, bringing in $15.6 million domestically. The buzzy horror movie has proved its staying power, raking in over $100 million globally since its release.",
      "Disney's \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d landed behind the horror movie once again, earning $9.2 million in North American theaters.",
      "The two films are \u201creal bright spots\u201d as the box office heads into a \u201crather quiet finish\u201d for the summer, said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for the data firm Comscore. Both films, which premiered simultaneously earlier this month, had a minimal 36% drop from last weekend.",
      "\u201cI think we have to look at the currency of the goodwill generated by people having these great summer moviegoing experiences,\u201d Dergarabedian said. \u201cWe have to look at that as a more important metric than just the bottom-line dollars and cents.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Fantastic Four: First Steps\" earned $5.9 million domestically during its fifth weekend. The movie enjoyed a strong $118 million debut but has experienced a steady decline.",
      "Newcomer \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d opened in 1,317 North American theaters with a weekend gross estimate of $3 million, in line with expectations. The movie made it to the top 10, right above \u201cThe Naked Gun.\"",

      "Actor Jerry Adler has died at 96",
      "NEW YORK -- Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind-the-scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a creature of nepotism,\u201d Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \u201cI got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\u201d",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \u201cSanta Barbara.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \u201cThe Public Eye\u201d and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \u201cchills\u201d when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d",

      "Films included Woody Allen's \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery,\u201d but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \u201cRescue Me,\u201d \u201cMad About You,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d and guest spots on shows ranging from \u201cThe West Wing\u201d to \u201cBroad City.\u201d",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \u201cTaller Than a Dwarf\u201d in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \u201cFish in the Dark.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\u201d Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\u201d",
      "Adler published a memoir, \u201cToo Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\u201d last year. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \u201ctoo goofy-looking\u201d to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",

      "Daniel Dae Kim is known for roles in spy thrillers and sci-fi epics but he still hopes to play a romantic lead",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After three decades in Hollywood, Daniel Dae Kim has done spy thrillers, sci-fi epics and medical dramas. But there\u2019s one role that\u2019s eluded the Korean American actor: romantic leading man. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years,\u201d Kim says with a laugh.",
      "His latest project, \u201cButterfly,\u201d which features a star-studded cast including top Korean actors Kim Tae-hee and Park Hae-soo (\u201cSquid Game\u201d), follows a former U.S. intelligence operative in South Korea whose past catches up with him. It premiered on Amazon Prime in the U.S. and elsewhere earlier this month, but makes its Korean debut Friday.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Seoul, South Korea, Kim revealed one of his biggest regrets, reflected on cultural lessons from the Korea-U.S. co-production, and opened up about what it\u2019s really like being the bridge between two cultures while pursuing his mission to tell stories \u201cthat haven\u2019t been told yet.\u201d The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "KIM: As an EP, I\u2019m a job creator. I am a person responsible for a lot of people, and I will fight so much harder for others than I often fight for myself. When I feel like one of the cast, or one of the crew, or one of the writers is not being taken care of, I\u2019m not afraid to talk to anybody and have a hard conversation.",
      "KIM: Every day, there was something that needed to be translated literally through language but also working styles. In Korea, because it\u2019s a more Confucian society, the hierarchy of departments is very clear. We had to learn to talk to the head of the department who would then talk to the staff, as opposed to if you have an issue with one of the staff, you go directly to the staff. This kind of thing was new to the Americans.",
      "KIM: I think in 2007 I got a DUI when I was working on \u201cLost,\u201d and I regret that night every day of my life. At the time, I felt so much shame, so much guilt, so much regret. I felt terrible to my parents, because that\u2019s not the way I think they wanted me to be raised. I think with the right perspective, these things, these mistakes that you made can actually be helpful for your life because they can guide you in certain ways.",
      "KIM: We\u2019re already seeing it. If you look at what happened with Paramount and CBS News, we\u2019re seeing a chilling effect on free speech and journalism and DEI. \u201cDEI\u201d is a bad word these days, but to me, DEI\u2019s not a fad. The idea of inclusion is not something that\u2019s a political trend. It\u2019s my life. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve lived every decade I\u2019ve been in this business.",

      "KIM: I got so much criticism when I did \u201cLost\u201d that I had to learn how to not take it so personally because it hurt a lot at the time. When I came to Korea when I was 18, cab drivers would give me such a hard time because I couldn\u2019t speak fluent Korean. And they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re Korean, your face is Korean, why don\u2019t you speak Korean?\u201d They had never thought about an immigrant experience from another country. But now Korea is so used to that kind of thing that people are much more understanding.",
      "KIM: I have a lot of sympathy for actors who take stereotypical roles when they\u2019re starting out because you need some way to break into the business. It\u2019s much easier once you\u2019re more successful and more established because you have more financial stability. It\u2019s something that, if you\u2019re not a person of color, or someone who\u2019s a minority in the United States, you don\u2019t have to think about. You don\u2019t think about what this role means for the rest of a nation or an ethnicity. You just do what you\u2019re drawn to, and that\u2019s very liberating. I am lucky enough now where I can also make those same choices. But I don\u2019t ever escape the fact that whatever I do will be watched and seen by so many people and judged through their own lens and filters.",
      "KIM: I\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years. I\u2019ve never gotten the opportunity and it\u2019s one of those interesting things because I look the way I do as an Asian American and Asian men were never considered handsome or sexy. That\u2019s changing now though. I\u2019m friends with Jimmy O. Yang and, a few years ago, he got to play a romantic lead in a rom-com. And I said to Jimmy like, \u201cWho would have thought you, Jimmy, would have been the one to be the romantic lead?\u201d But I was so happy for him because it meant that the way we were looking at Asian men was different.",

      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "The Menendez brothers are set to make their cases for parole this week",
      "LOS ANGELES -- After serving nearly 30 years in prison for killing their parents, the Menendez brothers will plead their case in front of a panel of California state parole board commissioners starting Thursday.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in August 1989. They were 18 and 21 at the time.",
      "For years after their convictions, the brothers filed petitions for appeals of their cases that were denied. But the brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life, marking the closest they\u2019ve been to freedom since their convictions.",
      "Even if the board grants their parole, it could still be months before the brothers walk free \u2014 if at all. If the board grants each brother\u2019s parole, the chief legal counsel has 120 days to review the case. Then, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has 30 days to affirm or deny the parole.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at their case over the last three decades:",
      "___",
      "March 1990: Lyle Menendez, then 21, is arrested. A few days later, Erik Menendez, 18, turns himself in. They are charged with first-degree murder.",
      "July 1993: The Menendez brothers go on trial, each with a separate jury. Prosecutors argued that they killed their parents for financial gain. The brothers\u2019 attorneys don\u2019t dispute the pair killed their parents, but argued that they acted out of self-defense after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father.",
      "January 1994: Both juries deadlock.",
      "October 1995: The brothers\u2019 retrial begins, this time with a single jury. Much of the defense evidence about alleged sexual abuse is excluded during the second trial.",
      "March 1996: Jurors convict both brothers of first-degree murder.",
      "July 1996: The brothers are sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "February 1998: A California appeals court upholds the brothers\u2019 conviction, and three months later, the state Supreme Court agrees.",
      "October 1998: The brothers file habeas corpus petitions with the California Supreme Court. After they are denied the next year, they file petitions in federal district court, which are also denied.",
      "September 2005: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denies their habeas corpus appeal.",
      "May 3: Attorneys for the Menendez brothers ask the court to reconsider the convictions and life sentences in light of new evidence from a former member of the boy band Menudo, who said he was raped by Jose Menendez when he was 14. In addition, they submit a letter that Erik wrote to his cousin before the killings about his father\u2019s abuse.",

The new film \u201cLurker,\u201d a Sundance breakout in theaters Friday, explores the question of what might happen if a certain type of fan got a foot in the door, and what they might do to stay there.",
      "Archie Madekwe\u2019s Oliver hardly knows what\u2019s coming when he walks into a trendy Los Angeles clothing shop. A rising music star, Oliver seems already accustomed to a certain amount of attention wherever he goes, with asks for selfies and autographs just part of the deal. So of course he\u2019s taken aback when one of the employees, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\u2019s Matthew, doesn\u2019t seem to know or care who he is. Oliver doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s an act and is soon asking this stranger to come around and hang with his entourage.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning Matthew thinks Oliver has this god-given place of celebrity and success,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cHe quickly understands that he will have to give things to serve a certain purpose in Oliver\u2019s world and his ego. But also that they\u2019re not dissimilar. They\u2019re both playing by a certain rule book that is written by Oliver. If the power becomes Matthew\u2019s, he can also write the rules.\u201d",
      "The film is the directorial debut of Alex Russell, whose own star is rising. He wrote \u201cForks,\u201d widely considered one of the best episodes of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d and won an Emmy for co-executive producing the Netflix series \u201cBeef.\u201d His script for \u201cLurker,\u201d which he wrote sort of as a challenge for himself during COVID lockdowns, immediately became a hot commodity. Madekwe remembers being bummed when he didn\u2019t hear back after he put himself on tape to play the hanger-on.",
      "A few years later, Madekwe\u2019s agent called and said Russell wanted to meet him. Not for Matthew, but for Oliver.",
      "\u201cI had to completely rethink the film and the structure and the what it was about,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cBut it was most daunting to imagine myself needing to go and meet Alex and convince him that I could play somebody like this cool character.\u201d",
      "He needn\u2019t have been so worried. Unbeknownst to Madekwe, Russell had been doing some stealth behind-the-scenes work. After someone recommended his name, Russell saw Madekwe in a coffee shop one day and just watched him for 20 minutes. His conclusion: This is Oliver.",
      "Russell was cognizant of the limitations he was faced with as a first-time director making an independent film, where things like casting and hiring are often rushed.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to get what I felt like were underrated actors,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPeople who could come in and really hit it out of the park. Then people would look at this movie and be like wow they really took a step up here. That\u2019s kind of where you can punch above your weight if you\u2019re making your first movie and don\u2019t have a huge budget.\u201d",

Putting it together was hard work, with strict limits on budget and time, but Russell said the experience of \u201cLurker\u201d was charmed nonetheless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because I got so lucky with decisions I made early on with casting and hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it is like I\u2019m just a kid with a screenplay and everyone else has to be really good at their job.\u201d",

That was helpful for me \u2014 it was like the fun aspect of the movie, not the hard-core humiliation.\u201d",
      "Many involved describe the process as uniquely collaborative. Madekwe also stepped up as a producer, which wasn\u2019t just a vanity title.

I think that conversation is really interesting and exciting. But most importantly, I think it\u2019s really exciting to be at the beginning of Alex Russell\u2019s career and to invest into a filmmaker that I think is gonna be making incredible films for a very long time.\u201d",

      "It'll surely carry weight in modern society, but the phrase is referencing events from nearly a century ago. Based on a true story, \u201cEden\u201d retraces what happened when a group of Europeans attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the earthly failings they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal and even murder.",
      "Howard assembles an impressive cast, though it isn't always enough to make up for the overambitious plot of a film that drags in the middle.",
      "1920s Germany, haunted after accepting blame for World War I, was on the brink of demise, as mass poverty and broad social unrest laid ground for the extremism that birthed the Nazi party.",
      "\u201cEden\u201d shows us none of that, instead dropping us on a small island of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where Dr. Friedrich Ritter ( Jude Law ) and his loyal partner, Dore Strauch Ritter ( Vanessa Kirby ) found solace after fleeing their native country. The idealist doctor is inspired by a newfound purpose of penning radical philosophy that will \u201csave humanity from itself.\u201d",
      "Yet the historical resonance, which could have provided pointed commentary on the parallels between today and the 1920s, falls flat amid the film\u2019s overlong runtime, unlikable characters and shaky accents that most actors stumble in and out of. In the midst of the film\u2019s crafted chaos, the story inevitably loses focus. Still, \u201cEden\u201d made room for some memorable performances.",

      "The Ritters' quiet isolation is disrupted by the couple, who arrive with Wittmer\u2019s young son, chasing the promise of an island utopia to ease their deep disillusionment with everyday reality.

      "The film lacks depth in exploring questions of morality and human nature while depicting Ritter\u2019s lofty goals to save humanity. His philosophy spirals into madness throughout the film, reduced to brief, sometimes painful and surface level sound bites that eventually devolve into incoherent ramblings.",

      "Prosecutors said in papers filed shortly before midnight Wednesday that Combs masterminded elaborate sexual events for two ex-girlfriends between 2008 and last year that involved hiring male sex workers who sometimes were required to cross multiple state lines to participate.",
      "A jury in July exonerated the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that carried the potential penalty of a mandatory 15 years in prison up to life behind bars. But it convicted him of two lesser Mann Act charges that prohibit interstate commerce related to prostitution.",
      "The Mann Act charges each carry a potential penalty of 10 years behind bars. Combs has been denied bail despite his lawyers' arguments that their client should face little to no additional jail time for the convictions. Prosecutors said he must serve multiple years behind bars.",
      "Combs has been in a federal jail in Brooklyn since his September arrest at a Manhattan hotel. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 3.",

      "\u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the Mann Act counts was overwhelming,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "They noted that the multiday, drug-fueled sexual marathons that Combs demanded of his girlfriends involved hiring male sex workers and facilitating their travel across multiple states for what became known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",

      "Their 2020 breakout film, \u201cThe Climb,\u201d begins with two best friends on a bike ride just before Kyle (Marvin) is to be wed. Mid-climb, Mike (Covino) confesses he slept with the bride-to-be. In one long take, an argument on two wheels ensues, with huffing and puffing in between.",
      "Their new follow-up to that film, \u201cSplitsville,\u201d likewise kicks off with heartbreak on the open road. This time, Carey (Marvin), a gym teacher, is driving along a highway with his life coach wife, Ashley (Adria Arjona). They seem happy enough, though there are hints of trouble. When Ashley says she wants to have new experiences, Carey suggests pottery. Ashley corrects him: \u201cI meant sexual.\u201d",

Their movies \u2014 Covino directs; they write together \u2014 are a little like Wile E. Coyote versions of a rom-com.

From there, the four central characters of the film \u2014 Carey, Paul, Julie and Ashley \u2014 will take various turns in less of a romantic triangle than an adult game of musical chairs.",
      "Though there are elaborately choreographed long takes that smack of contemporary moviemaking, \u201cSplitsville\u201d belongs more to a screwball tradition stretching back to the 1930s. This is \u2014 even here in the low ebb of late summer \u2014 an uncommonly adult farce of infidelity that Cary Grant and Irene Dunne might have chuckled at, even if they didn\u2019t get the \u201cVanilla Sky\u201d reference, the digs about New Balance sneakers or the delight of seeing Nicholas Braun turn up, late in the film, as a mentalist.",
      "I\u2019m convinced, though, that the performer here who would have been most at home in that bygone comedy heyday is Johnson. For the second time this year, following \u201cMateralists,\u201d she finds herself caught between the affections of two men.

      "LAS VEGAS -- Tourism in Las Vegas is slumping this summer, with resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, especially from abroad, and some officials are blaming the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration policies for the decline.",
      "The city known for lavish shows, endless buffets and around-the-clock gambling welcomed just under 3.1 million tourists in June, an 11% drop compared to the same time in 2024. There were 13% fewer international travelers, and hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",

Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular. Wendy Hart, who books trips from Windsor, Ontario, said the reason was \u201cpolitics, for sure.\u201d She speculated it was a point of \u201cnational pride\u201d that people were staying away from the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state.",

But the downturn comes after a post-COVID spike, Stevens said. And while hotel room bookings are slack, gaming numbers, especially for sports betting, are still strong, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's not as if the sky is falling,\u201d he said. Wealthier visitors are still coming, he said, and Circa has introduced cheaper package deals to lure those with less money to spend.",

      "BERLIN -- In a secluded lot next to a former gasworks in suburban Berlin, Martin R\u00f6tzel is breathing new life into a tradition of centuries past: the monastery garden.",
      "R\u00f6tzel's Monk Garden is home to between 150 and 200 types of herbs, leaves and trees including many that are unlikely to be found at any German supermarket. There are numerous varieties of mint, oregano and cilantro, hyssop and New Zealand spinach, four-leaf sorrel, yarrow and a local variety of tarragon.",
      "R\u00f6tzel has built Monk Garden as a business since 2022, delivering to high-end restaurants that want flavorsome local plants for their dishes. It also organizes \u201cwild herb walks\u201d and workshops showing people how to make skin cream, wine and other items from the plants.",
      "Packed into about 2,000 square meters (21,530 square feet) in Marienfelde, on Berlin\u2019s southern edge, each of the plants has its own flavors and tangs and, in many cases, medicinal properties.",
      "R\u00f6tzel, a trained hotelier who also has worked as a dancer, said his knowledge of plants came from his father, while his passion for them goes back to the age of 4 or 5 when he started collecting wild herbs.",
      "During an illness 13 years ago, he deepened his knowledge of herbs and made teas that he said helped him regain his health. He also set up a medicinal monastic garden next to a church in the German capital, mirroring those grown in the Middle Ages to provide plants for food and healing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, the knowledge was lost,\u201d which was exacerbated by \u201cthe industrialization of food,\" R\u00f6tzel said. These days, \u201csomething like 99% of people don't know a single name of a plant.\"",

      "The Alaska State Medical Board will be considering language that says medical professionals provide gender-affirming care for children could risk having their work considered unprofessional conduct",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Alaska medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care for children could risk disciplinary action under a proposal set for review by the state medical board on Friday.",
      "The proposal would deem any professional who uses hormonal and surgical treatments for minors \u201cas being grossly negligent\u201d and subject to sanctions by the board, according to the board\u2019s minutes from a June meeting.",
      "The type and extent of disciplinary actions were not spelled out, and board member Matt Heilala, an Anchorage podiatrist who was helping write the proposed regulations, declined to discuss the details Thursday with The Associated Press ahead of the meeting.",
      "The move comes after the board in March sent a letter to state lawmakers expressing opposition to hormonal or surgical gender-affirming care for minors and urging legislators to enact limits on treatments. The Legislature \u2014 controlled by bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate \u2014 didn\u2019t take up the issue before adjourning in May.",
      "Critics worry the board is overstepping its authority in pursuing regulations that could leave medical providers open to possible disciplinary actions. Instead of allowing the legislative process to play out, \u201cthey are now becoming the legislators themselves, which is inappropriate,\u201d said state Sen. L\u00f6ki Tobin, a Democrat who has been outspoken in support of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "The medical board at a June meeting designated member Heilala to help draft a statement for consideration that would pertain to declaring those providing the care \u201cas being grossly negligent and therefore subject to disciplinary sanctions,\u201d according to the minutes of that meeting.",
      "Heilala declined to discuss the specific language stemming from that directive that the board would consider Friday but told the AP that the proposed rules would go through a deliberate and transparent process for the public. Such processes can take months, he said.",
      "Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person\u2019s gender identity, including when it\u2019s different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It encompasses counseling, medications that block puberty and hormone therapy to produce physical changes as well as surgeries to transform chests and genitals, though those are rare for minors.",
      "Most major medical groups say access to the treatment is important for those with gender dysphoria and see gender as existing along a spectrum. While there\u2019s wide, if not universal, medical consensus, the political situation is contentious.",
      "In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott had issued an order allowing the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse. But a Texas judge in 2022 blocked the state from investigating families of transgender youths who have received such care and members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. over such medical care.",
      "Tom Pittman, executive director of Identity Inc., an Anchorage-based advocacy and health care organization for the LGBTQ+ community, said about 500 Alaska medical professionals have signed an open letter opposing the changes being considered by the board.",

      "Swiss medical regulators have approved a new malaria treatment for infants, offering hope to many in Africa",
      "KAMPALA, Uganda -- Alice Nekesa did not know she was infected with malaria-causing parasites until it was too late. She was in the fourth month of pregnancy last year when she started bleeding, a miscarriage later attributed to untreated malaria in her.",
      "The Ugandan farmer said recently that she regretted the loss of what would have been her second child \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t discover malaria and treat it early.\u201d",
      "Variations of such cases are commonly reported by Ugandan health workers who witness stillbirths or feverish babies that die within days from undiagnosed malaria. The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",
      "Swissmedic said the treatment, a sweet-tasting tablet that disperses into a syrup when dropped into water, was approved in coordination with the World Health Organization under a fast-track authorization process to help developing countries access much-needed treatment.",
      "Africa\u2019s 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the WHO. More than three-quarters of those deaths were among children.",
      "In Uganda, an east African country of 45 million people, there were 12.6 million malaria cases and nearly 16,000 deaths in 2023. Many were children younger than 5 and pregnant women, according to WHO.",
      "Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 in that order \u2014 are the African countries most burdened by malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes that thrive and breed in stagnant water.",
      "The drug approved by Swiss authorities, known as Coartem Baby in some countries and Riamet Baby in others, is a combination of two antimalarials. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including for older children. Before Coartem Baby, antimalarial drugs designed for older children were administered to small infants with careful adjustments to avoid overdose or toxicity.",
      "Ugandan authorities, who have been working to update clinical guidelines for treating malaria, say the new drug will be rolled out as soon as possible. It is not yet available in public hospitals.",
      "The development of Coartem Baby has given hope to many, with local health workers and others saying the medicine will save the lives of many infants.",
      "Ronald Serufusa, the top malaria official for the district of Wakiso, which shares a border with the Ugandan capital of Kampala, said he believes Coartem Baby will be available \u201cvery, very soon\u201d and that one priority is sensitizing the people adhering to treatment.",

      "The group\u2019s new COVID-19 recommendations \u2014 released Tuesday \u2014 come amid a tumultuous year for public health, as vaccine skeptics have come into power in the new Trump administration and government guidance has become increasingly confusing.",

      "\u201cIt is going to be somewhat confusing. But our opinion is we need to make the right choices for children to protect them,\u201d he added.",
      "The AAP is strongly recommending COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years. Shots also are advised for older children if parents want their kids vaccinated, the AAP said.",
      "That differs from guidance established under U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which doesn't recommend the shots for healthy children of any age but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.",
      "Children ages 6 months to 2 years are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and it was important that recommendations continue to emphasize the need for them to get vaccinated, said Campbell, a University of Maryland infectious diseases expert.",

      "Chinese officials have showcased what they claim will be the world's largest solar farm on the Tibetan plateau",
      "TALATAN, China -- Chinese government officials last month showed off what they say will be the world's largest solar farm when completed high on a Tibetan plateau. It will cover 610 square kilometers (235 square miles), which is the size of Chicago.",
      "China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.",
      "The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.",
      "For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",
      "\u201cChina needs to get to that 3% territory as soon as possible,\u201d he said.",
      "China's emissions have fallen before during economic slowdowns. What's different this time is electricity demand is growing \u2014 up 3.7% in the first half of this year \u2014 but the increase in power from solar, wind and nuclear has easily outpaced that, according to Myllyvirta, who analyzes the most recent data in a study published on the U.K.-based Carbon Brief website.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re talking really for the first time about a structural declining trend in China\u2019s emissions,\u201d he said.",
      "China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.",
      "Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, described the plateauing of China's carbon emissions as a turning point in the effort to combat climate change.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of global significance, offering a rare glimmer of hope in an otherwise bleak climate landscape,\u201d he wrote in an email response. It also shows that a country can cut emissions while still growing economically, he said.",
      "But Li cautioned that China's heavy reliance on coal remains a serious threat to progress on climate and said the economy needs to shift to less resource-intensive sectors. \u201cThere's still a long road ahead,\u201d he said.",
      "A seemingly endless expanse of solar panels stretches toward the horizon on the Tibetan plateau. White two-story buildings rise above them at regular intervals.",
      "In an area that is largely desert, the massive solar project has wrought a surprising change on the landscape. The panels act as windbreaks to reduce dust and sand and slow soil evaporation, giving vegetation a foothold. Thousands of sheep, dubbed \u201cphotovoltaic sheep,\u201d graze happily on the scrubby plants.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test-firing of two types of new antiair missiles, state media said Sunday, displaying his expanding military capabilities as the South Korean and U.S. militaries carry out joint drills.",
      "The North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said the test Saturday proved the missiles effective in countering aerial threats such as drones and cruise missiles, and that Kim assigned unspecified \u201cimportant\u201d tasks to defense scientists ahead of a major political conference expected early next year.",
      "The report did not specify the missiles that were tested or where the event took place. It did not mention any remarks by Kim directed at Washington or Seoul.",
      "The test coincided with new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung \u2019s trip to Tokyo for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, where they vowed to strengthen bilateral cooperation and their trilateral partnership with the United States to address common challenges, including North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Lee was to depart for Washington on Sunday for a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Kim\u2019s government has repeatedly dismissed calls by Seoul and Washington to restart long-stalled negotiations aimed at winding down his nuclear weapons and missiles programs, as he continues to prioritize Russia as part of a foreign policy aimed at expanding ties with nations confronting the United States.",
      "Since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Kim has sent thousands of troops and large shipments of weapons, including artillery and ballistic missiles, to help fuel President Vladimir Putin\u2019s warfighting.",

South Korea\u2019s previous conservative government said in November that Russia supplied missiles and other equipment to help strengthen air defenses of the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, but did not specify which systems were provided. Kim held a ceremony in Pyongyang last week to honor North Korean soldiers who fought in Ukraine, awarding state \u201chero\u201d titles to those who returned and placing medals beside 101 portraits of the fallen, praising them as \u201cgreat men, great heroes and great patriots,\u201d state media reported. According to South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent around 15,000 troops to Russia since last fall and about 600 of them have died in combat. Kim has also agreed to send thousands of military construction workers and deminers to Russia\u2019s Kursk region, a deployment South Korean intelligence believes could happen soon.",

      "Ukraine is marking 34 years of independence, and the country\u2019s first generation of lawmakers and activists are reflecting on how early decisions shaped its struggle today",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Oleksandr Donii was one of the leaders of student-led protests for sovereignty and political reform in 1990 that preceded Ukraine\u2019s declaration of independence. He remembers thinking the fight for autonomy would take decades.",
      "Instead, it came much sooner than he ever imagined. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine quickly declared independence in 1991 and later conducted a referendum backed by more than 90% of voters.",
      "\u201dI was preparing myself for prisons and labor camps, and I thought the struggle would last about 20\u201330 years,\u201d Donii told The Associated Press.",
      "As the country marks 34 years since that monumental event Sunday, Donii and others from Ukraine\u2019s first generation of lawmakers and activists describe how despite separation from the Soviet Union, Moscow's grip endured. Russia used political pressure, social division and the sidelining of pro-Western voices. That eventually paved the way for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three decades later and Ukraine\u2019s current fight for independence and identity in the face of its aggressive neighbor.",
      "Back in 1990, Donii and other student leaders of a hunger strike were calling not only for breaking away from Moscow but also for renewing the political system at home.",
      "Their first proposal was to conduct snap elections for Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, which Donii saw as essential for clearing out the Soviet-era lawmakers still in office. The idea, however, failed to gain broad support even among pro-independence forces.",
      "\u201cUkraine, having won independence, did not win the removal of the Communist ruling class,\u201d he said.",
      "In his view, opportunities that were within reach in the early 1990s slipped away, leaving Ukraine to pay a high price today as it presses toward the European Union and NATO not as distant aspirations but as urgent necessities for safeguarding sovereignty and securing an independent path.",
      "Oleksandr Nechyporenko, a lawmaker from the first Ukrainian Parliament, remembers how fragmented society was on the verge of independence.",
      "\u201cA very large part was neutral, it included people who wavered, who didn\u2019t have enough information,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere was also a big and powerful core that was categorically in favor of preserving the Soviet Union, communist rule, ties with Russia, and so on.\u201d Nechyporenko says the \u201cpassionate change-makers\u201d were a minority.",
      "In his view, Ukraine\u2019s tolerance toward agents of Russian influence since the early days of its independence was a major mistake. \u201cWe should have been more firm, more radical,\u201d he said.",

      "That sense of missed resolve is not limited to politics alone. Decisions made in the early years of independence continue to weigh heavily as Ukraine now fights for survival against Russia. One of the most consequential was the choice to surrender the vast nuclear arsenal left on Ukrainian soil after the Soviet collapse.",
      "\u201cThe path we were supposed to take with the world\u2019s third-largest nuclear arsenal \u2014 about five thousand nuclear warheads \u2014 that path should have given us the opportunity to effectively use this potential for integration with the West,\u201d said Yurii Kostenko, a scholar and politician who led negotiations on Ukraine\u2019s nuclear disarmament in the early 1990s.",
      "He says that while leading the negotiation process, his vision of nuclear disarmament included the U.S. assisting Ukraine financially and technologically to turn nuclear warheads into fuel for nuclear power plants. Accession to NATO would have been Ukraine\u2019s guarantee of security. The American side was ready to make it happen, Kostenko says.",
      "But instead of cooperation with the U.S., Kostenko recalls Ukraine being eventually pressured into surrendering its warheads to Russia, receiving almost nothing in return. He said to achieve that, then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded Kostenko\u2019s dismissal as leader of the negotiations by Ukraine\u2019s then-President Leonid Kravchuk. That demand was granted.",
      "No longer led by Kostenko, Ukraine\u2019s delegation dropped the initial plan codesigned with the U.S. and chose to cooperate with Russia instead. Kostenko says that in exchange for its nukes, Ukraine received $1.5 billion in nuclear fuel and natural gas from Russia, which, he says, was worth around 1% of what Ukraine gave up.",
      "Instead of NATO accession, Ukraine received the Budapest Memorandum, an agreement in which Ukraine was granted assurances of sovereignty and territorial integrity from the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia. For many Ukrainians, it has become a symbol of promises that carried no weight. Moscow shredded the agreement first with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and then with the full-scale invasion in 2022. Three decades later, as Ukraine once again negotiates its future with Western partners under the shadow of Russian aggression, the choices and compromises of the 1990s still loom large, shaping its search for lasting security.",

      "Iran's foreign minister is planning a call with French, German, and British counterparts to avoid U.N. sanctions over its nuclear program",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Just days away from a European deadline, Iran said Friday its foreign minister would hold a telephone conference call with his French, German and British counterparts to avoid the reimposition of United Nations sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.",
      "The call, planned for Friday by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, comes as the three parties to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal threaten to reimpose those sanctions under a mechanism known as \u201csnapback\u201d in the accord. The European Union's chief diplomat will also join the call, IRNA said.",
      "The Europeans' concern over the Iranian program, which had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels before the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June saw its atomic sites bombed, has only grown since Tehran cut off all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the conflict's wake. That has left the international community further blinded to Iran's program \u2014 as well as the status of its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Iran has long insisted its program is peaceful, though it is the only non-nuclear-armed nation enriching uranium at that level. The U.S., the IAEA and others assess Iran had a nuclear weapons program up until 2003.",
      "In a letter Aug. 8, the three European nations warned Iran it would proceed with \u201csnapback\u201d if Tehran didn't reach a \u201csatisfactory solution\u201d to the nuclear issues. That deadline would be Aug. 31, in nine days, leaving little time for Iran to likely reach any agreement with the Europeans, who have grown increasingly skeptical of Iran over years of inconclusive negotiations over its nuclear program.",
      "Restoring the IAEA's access is a key part of the talks. Iran has blamed the war with Israel in part on the IAEA, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, without offering any evidence. The IAEA issues quarterly reports on Iran's program and the 2015 deal gave it greater access to keep track of it.",

Security Council members China and Russia, two nations that have provided some support to Iran in the past but stayed out of the June war.",

      "Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister of Thailand, remains one of the country\u2019s most influential and controversial figures nearly two decades after being ousted in a 2006 military coup",
      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister of Thailand, remains one of the country\u2019s most influential and controversial figures nearly two decades after being ousted in a 2006 military coup. His political journey, marked by unprecedented popularity, a dramatic fall from power, years in self-imposed exile and a high-profile return, continues to shape Thailand\u2019s political landscape.",
      "His dramatic path took another turn on Friday, defying expectations when a court that has historically leaned against him and his political machine acquitted him of royal defamation, an offense that could have sent him to prison for up to 15 years.",
      "Despite powerful enemies in the Thai establishment and criminal convictions for corruption, he avoided prison by going into exile after his ouster. His return home in August 2023 had seemed to signal an accommodation with his opponents.",
      "However, his insistence on maintaining a high public profile \u2014 he was seen as the real power directing the government, especially when his daughter, Paetongtarn, became prime minister last year \u2014 kept old enmities alive and embroiled him in fresh legal challenges from those wishing to curb his influence.",
      "The Shinawatra family is prominent in the northern city of Chiang Mai, where Thaksin was born to a mercantile family in 1949. After a career in public service as a police colonel, Thaksin became a business entrepreneur in the late 1970s. He built a telecommunications empire starting with Advanced Info Systems, an early mobile phone service provider and the primary source of his fortune.",
      "He entered politics in 1994, holding Cabinet posts before establishing the Thai Rak Thai Party in 1998. Using his fortune to build a nationwide political machine, he promoted populist policies that resonated with lower-income citizens, especially in the countryside.",
      "His platform promised to spread economic growth and bridge the wealth gap, with signature policies including universal healthcare and village development funds. This led to landslide victories for his party in 2001 and 2005, making him the first elected Thai prime minister to complete a four-year term and the country\u2019s longest-serving democratically elected leader.",
      "However, Thaksin\u2019s massive popularity and electoral support rocked Thailand\u2019s established political order. This earned him powerful enemies among conservative forces, including the army and the courts, which saw him as a threat to the monarchy, the bedrock of Thai identity, as well as to their own influence.",
      "He also faced criticism for his imperious CEO-style governance, intolerance of criticism, especially from the media, and failure to distance his business interests from government policy. His administration was also blamed for setting off a persistent Muslim insurgency in Thailand's southern provinces and for what human rights advocates said were more than 2,000 extrajudicial killings during his war on drugs.",
      "His second term was cut short by a military coup in 2006 while he was abroad. Opponents accused him of corruption, abuse of power, and disrespecting then-King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and hounded him with legal cases that he characterized as politically motivated.",
      "Thaksin\u2019s ouster triggered nearly two decades of deep political polarization, pitting his supporters against opponents including better-off urban dwellers, ardent royalists and the military. He briefly returned in 2008 to face charges but skipped bail and fled abroad again, commencing a self-imposed exile lasting over a decade.",
      "Despite his physical absence, Thaksin remained a beloved and influential figure among his followers, whom he encouraged remotely. Parties formed from the ashes of his Thai Rak Thai Party and still under his influence consistently won elections but just as consistently were driven from office by legal challenges in courts hostile to him and destabilizing street protests.",

      "While in exile, Thaksin, who had his Thai passport revoked, obtained another from Montenegro through investment and spent significant time in Dubai. He also purchased and sold Manchester City Football Club and invested in mining in Africa.",
      "Thaksin\u2019s return became possible after the progressive Move Forward Party\u2019s victory in 2023 rattled the establishment that had so abhorred him. This led to what many called a \u201cself-serving deal\u201d between Thaksin and his former conservative foes, a move that alienated many supporters even as it returned Pheu Thai to power while keeping Move Forward out of government.",
      "His dramatic return to Bangkok in August 2023 occurred on the same day Pheu Thai formed a new coalition government, after royalist Senators refused to endorse Move Forward's mandate from the voters.",
      "Upon his return, Thaksin was sentenced to an eight-year prison term for corruption but was immediately transferred to a fancy hospital suite due to ill health, a diagnosis regarded with skepticism by many. His sentence was reduced to a single year by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and he was released on parole in February 2024 after six months.",
      "Critics questioned his illness, viewing his abbreviated stay as a \u201cspecial privilege.\u201d A court next month will rule on whether his serving time in a hospital rather than prison was the result of a fraudulent medical diagnosis, which could result in him being imprisoned.",
      "After his release from hospital, Thaksin has maintained a high public profile, traveling around the country and offering political observations. He is widely considered the de facto leader of Pheu Thai and the power behind its government.",
      "His indictment for royal defamation \u2014 an offense also known as l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 \u2014 stemmed from 2015 remarks he made in an interview while in exile. The controversial law, punishable by three to 15 years in prison, is often criticized for being applied for political purposes, with its targets often activists known for being outspoken.",
      "Even without a conviction, or during the appeals process, the threat of it is used as a tool to keep dissidents in check, but Thaksin beat the odds on Friday with his acquittal.",

      "\u201cI mean, the discussion all about what Ukraine should give up, what the concessions that Ukraine is willing to (make), whereas we are forgetting that Russia has not made one single concession and they are the ones who are the aggressor here, they are the ones who are brutally attacking another country and killing people,\u201d she said.",

      "Establishing postwar Western security guarantees for Ukraine, which Kyiv insists are needed to deter another Russian attack, is under discussion by a variety of countries, Kallas said, noting that \u201cit does sound like we are some way off in terms of pinning that down.\u201d",
      "\u201cRussia is just dragging feet. It\u2019s clear that Russia does not want peace,\u201d Kallas said. \u201cPresident Trump has been repeatedly saying that the killing has to stop and Putin is just laughing, not stopping the killing, but increasing the killing.\u201d",
      "Ukraine, meanwhile, has hit back at Russia with long-range weapons that are targeting infrastructure supporting Moscow\u2019s war effort. It has hit oil refineries, among other targets, and Russian wholesale gasoline prices have reached record highs in recent days.",

    "story": [
      "The nonprofit that manages Central Park has thrown its support behind a proposal to end the horse-drawn carriages that have been fixtures in the greenspace for more than 150 years",
      "NEW YORK -- For more than 150 years, horse-drawn carriages have been trotting through Manhattan's Central Park, weathering the arrival of the automobile, years of criticism from animal rights activists and even a mayoral administration that vowed to ban the tourist activity.",
      "But now the influential nonprofit that manages the 843-acre park \u2014 and has previously stayed out of the debate \u2014 has now thrown its support behind a proposal to wind down the industry as early as next summer.",
      "The Central Park Conservancy argued in an Aug. 12 letter to the City Council that horse carriages have an outsized impact on public safety and road infrastructure in the increasingly crowded park.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t be just frozen in time,\u201d said Elizabeth Smith, the conservancy's CEO, in an interview this week. \u201cHorses are too unpredictable and the roadways are too busy with too many different kinds of users now \u2014 bikers, runners, pedestrians, strollers.\u201d",
      "Smith noted other cities have done away with the nostalgic rides, including San Antonio, which passed a five-year phase out of the industry last year. Chicago banned it starting in 2021 and Montreal did the same the year prior.",
      "The carriage industry argues it\u2019s being unfairly singled out, despite the number of horses in the park barely budging since World War II.",
      "There are currently 68 licensed carriage owners with a total of about 200 horses and 170 drivers, according to the Transport Workers Union, which represents industry employees.",
      "Meanwhile, Central Park sees some 40 million visitors annually, many of them increasingly zipping around on rental bikes or hitching a ride on one of the human-powered pedicabs that line the park\u2019s entry points. Cars were banned from the park's drives in 2018.",
      "Eliminating carriage horses also goes against famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s vision for the park, with its hilly paths and undulating roads tailor-made for leisurely carriage rides, argues Christina Hansen, a longtime carriage driver and industry spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the park the way it was meant to be seen,\u201d she said as she gave a recent tour, which runs about $72 for the first 20 minutes and $29 for each additional 10 minutes.",
      "Animal rights groups have long complained the horses can get easily spooked on city streets, leading to accidents and injuries. They also claim the horses are overworked and live in inadequate stables and their drivers flaunt city regulations, including leaving behind piles of horse manure. All animals are supposed to be fitted with manure-catching devices.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no way to operate horse-drawn carriages and have it be safe or humane for the horses,\u201d said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of the animal rights group New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets. \u201cNo amount of regulation can change that. Lord knows we have tried.\u201d",
      "The conservancy\u2019s call came after a carriage horse collapsed and died near its stables earlier this month, with videos and photos of the animal\u2019s body in a city street circulating widely online.",
      "But the organization, which was formed to revitalize the park in the 1980s, didn\u2019t weigh in on the animal welfare concerns in its letter to the council.",
      "Smith said the tipping point was two recent incidents of carriage horses running amok: in May, a spooked horse bolted from its handler and ran loose through the park. Days later, two more horses broke free from their drivers and crashed into a fleet of parked pedicabs, breaking a driver\u2019s wrist and causing other injuries.",

      "Lynn Buckalew, a tourist from Utah lined up for a carriage ride earlier this week, said a guided jaunt through the park was high on her to-do list. But she was taken aback when she learned about the complaints of abuse and the Aug. 5 death of a 15-year-old mare from an aortic rupture less than two months into the job.",
      "\u201cYou know that\u2019s sad, if that\u2019s the case. It makes me look at it a little different,\u201d Buckalew said as her husband hopped on the carriage and the driver called her aboard.",

      "When ESPN opted out of its contract with Major League Baseball in February, the network was hoping to get a reworked package at a lower cost while Commissioner Rob Manfred thought the sport could optimize its rights in the short term for Home Run Derby and Wild Card round.",
      "In the end, both parties may get what they want.",
      "According to people familiar with negotiations, ESPN is nearing a deal to distribute out-of-market games while NBC/Peacock, Netflix, Apple TV are in talks for regular-season packages, the Wild Card round and Home Run Derby.",
      "All sides hope to have everything finalized by the end of the regular season next month, three people told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contracts have not been finalized or announced by either side.",
      "The negotiations around the three-year deals is complicated due to the fact that MLB is also trying not to slight two of its other rights holders. MLB receives an average of $729 million from Fox and $470 million from Turner Sports per year under deals which expire after the 2028 season.",
      "While ESPN would be losing the playoffs and Home Run Derby, it would be gaining something it considers more valuable \u2014 the MLB.TV streaming package of out-of-market games as part of the direct-to-consumer service that launched on Thursday. ESPN would also sell the in-market rights to the five teams whose games are produced by MLB \u2014 San Diego, Colorado, Arizona, Cleveland and Minnesota.",
      "\u201cWe are engaged. We are having healthy conversations with them. Nothing to announce today, but we\u2019re very interested in baseball in general,\u201d ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said on Tuesday during a presentation about the network's DTC service.",
      "ESPN, which has carried MLB games since 1990, opted out of the final three years of a seven-year deal in February. The package averaged $550 million per season and also included the Home Run Derby and Wild Card games.",
      "Baseball would be the second league that would have its out-of-market digital package available in the U.S. on ESPN\u2019s platform. The NHL moved its package to ESPN in 2021.",
      "It would also be a win-win situation for MLB and ESPN. Manfred wrote in a memo to owners after ESPN opted out of its contract: \u201cWhile ESPN has stated they would like to continue to have MLB on their platform, particularly in light of the upcoming launch of their DTC product, we do not think its beneficial for us to accept a smaller deal to remain on a shrinking platform. In order to best position MLB to optimize our rights going in to our next deal cycle, we believe it is not prudent to devalue our rights with an existing partner but rather to have our marquee regular season games, Home Run Derby and Wild Card playoff round on a new broadcast and/or streaming platform.\u201d",
      "The moves keep ESPN involved in baseball, but at a point where it can benefit while MLB could benefit from other partners in a short-term deal.",
      "There is a possibility that ESPN would still air 30 regular-season games, but not Sunday nights. That package of games would go to NBC/Peacock, along with the Wild Card round.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House's demands.",
      "For months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump's constant hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September.",
      "It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature.",
      "Trump has urged Powell to slash rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.",
      "Powell, on the other hand, has suggested that a rate cut is likely for reasons quite different than Trump's: He is worried that the economy is weakening. His remarks on Friday at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming also indicated that the Fed will move carefully and cut rates at a much slower pace than Trump wants.",
      "Powell pointed to economic growth that \u201chas slowed notably in the first half of this year,\u201d to an annual rate of 1.2%, down from 2.5% last year. There has also been a \u201cmarked slowing\u201d in the demand for workers, he added, which threatens to raise unemployment.",
      "Still, Powell said that tariffs have started to lift the price of goods and could continue to push inflation higher, a possibility Fed officials will closely monitor and that will make them cautious about additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed\u2019s key short-term interest rate, which influences other borrowing costs for things like mortgages and auto loans, is currently 4.3%. Trump has called for it to be cut as low as 1% \u2014 a level no Fed official supports.",
      "However the Fed moves forward, it will likely do so while continuing to assert its longstanding independence. A politically independent central bank is considered by most economists as critical to preventing inflation, because it can take steps \u2014 such as raising interest rates to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 that are harder for elected officials to do.",
      "There are 19 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, 12 of whom vote on rate decisions. One of them, Beth Hammack, president of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Cleveland branch, said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press that she is committed to the Fed\u2019s independence.",

      "\u201cInflation is too high and it\u2019s been trending in the wrong direction,\u201d Hammack said. \u201cRight now I see us moving away from our goals on the inflation side.\u201d",

Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to head the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged Wednesday that Cook committed mortgage fraud when she bought two properties in 2021. She has not been charged.",

He has already nominated a top White House economist, Stephen Miran, to replace former governor Adriana Kugler, who stepped down Aug. 1.",

      "\u201cThe president has a long history of applying pressure to Chairman Powell,\u201d Strain said. \u201cAnd Chairman Powell has a long history of resisting that pressure. So it would be odd, I think, if on his way out the door, he caved for the first time.\u201d",
      "Still, Strain thinks that Powell is overestimating the risk that the economy will weaken further and push unemployment higher. If inflation worsens while hiring continues, that could force the Fed to potentially reverse course and increase rates again next year.",
      "\u201cThat would do further damage to the Fed's credibility around maintaining low and stable price inflation,\u201d he said.",

      "Marissa Loewen first started using artificial intelligence in 2014 as a project management tool. She has autism and ADHD and said it helped immensely with organizing her thoughts.",
      "\u201cWe try to use it conscientiously though because we do realize that there is an impact on the environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Her personal AI use isn't unique anymore. Now it\u2019s a feature in smartphones, search engines, word processors and email services. Every time someone uses AI, it uses energy that is often generated by fossil fuels. That releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and contributes to climate change.",
      "And it's getting harder to live without it.",
      "AI is largely powered by data centers that field queries, store data and deploy information. As AI becomes ubiquitous, the power demand for data centers increases, leading to grid reliability problems for people living nearby.",
      "\u201cSince we are trying to build data centers at a pace where we cannot integrate more renewable energy resources into the grid, most of the new data centers are being powered by fossil fuels,\u201d said Noman Bashir, computing and climate impact fellow with MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium.",
      "The data centers also generate heat, so they rely on fresh water to stay cool. Larger centers can consume up to 5 million gallons (18.9 million liters) a day, according to an article from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. That's roughly the same as the daily water demand for a town of up to 50,000 people.",
      "It\u2019s difficult to imagine, because for most users the impact isn\u2019t visible, said AI and Climate Lead Sasha Luccioni with the AI company, Hugging Face.",
      "\u201cIn one of my studies, we found that generating a high-definition image uses as much energy as charging half of your phone. And people were like, \u2018That can\u2019t be right, because when I use Midjourney (a generative AI program), my phone battery doesn\u2019t go down,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "Jon Ippolito, professor of new media at the University of Maine, said tech companies are constantly working to make chips and data centers more efficient, but that does not mean AI\u2019s environmental impact will shrink. That\u2019s because of a problem called the Jevons Paradox.",
      "\u201cThe cheaper resources get, the more we tend to use them anyway,\u201d he said. When cars replaced horses, he said, commute times didn\u2019t shrink. We just traveled farther.",
      "How much those programs contribute to global warming depends on a lot of factors, including how warm it is outside the data center that's processing the query, how clean the grid is and how complex the AI task is.",
      "Information sources on AI's contributions to climate change are incomplete and contradictory, so getting exact numbers is difficult.",
      "But Ippolito tried anyway.",
      "He built an app that compares the environmental footprint of different digital tasks based on the limited data he could find. It estimates that a simple AI prompt, such as, \u201cTell me the capital of France,\u201d uses 23 times more energy than the same question typed into Google without its AI Overview feature.",
      "\u201cInstead of working with existing materials, it's writing them from scratch. And that takes a lot more compute,\u201d Luccioni said.",

      "\u201cIt's not just about making people conscious of AI's impact, but also all of these digital activities we take for granted,\u201d he said.",
      "Ippolito said he limits his use of AI when he can. He suggests using human-captured images instead of AI-generated ones. He tells the AI to stop generating as soon as he has the answer to avoid wasting extra energy. He requests concise answers and he begins Google searches by typing \u201c-ai\u201d so it doesn't provide an AI overview for queries where he doesn't need it.",
      "Loewen has adopted the same approach. She said she tries to organize her thoughts into one AI query instead of asking it a series of iterative questions. She also built her own AI that doesn\u2019t rely on large data centers, which saves energy in the same way watching a movie you own on a DVD is far less taxing than streaming one.",

      "But AI is only taking up a fraction of the data center's energy use. Ippolito estimates roughly 85% is data collection from sites like TikTok and Instagram, and cryptocurrency.",
      "His answer there: make use of screen time restrictions on your phone to limit time scrolling on social media. Less time means less personal data collected, less energy and water used, and fewer carbon emissions entering the atmosphere.",

No farmer wants to switch and then find that matcha fever has died.",

The agency said that tens of thousands of customers have reported difficulties with these policies to date.",

And if a customer opts for in-person cancellation, there\u2019s limited hours and often difficulty finding a manager to process the forms, the complaint notes \u2014 while mailing the form comes with additional costs.",
      "\u201cEach of these cancellation methods is opaque, complicated, and demanding \u2014 far from simple,\u201d the FTC writes in its complaint. It also alleges that the company doesn\u2019t adequately disclose cancellation offerings when consumers sign up for memberships, and that some will be signed up for additional services with recurring charges without realizing there may be different cancellation requirements.",

      "Ukraine's defense industry is gaining global attention for its innovative drone technology",
      "When a Ukrainian-made drone attacked an ammunition depot in Russia last September, it showcased Kyiv\u2019s determination to strike deep behind enemy lines and the prowess of its defense industry.",
      "The moment was especially gratifying for the woman in charge of manufacturing the drones that flew more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) to carry out this mission. For months after, Russia no longer had the means to keep up devastating glide bomb attacks like the one that had just targeted her native city of Kharkiv.",
      "\u201cFighting in the air is our only real asymmetric advantage on the battlefield at the moment. We don\u2019t have as much manpower or money as they have,\u201d said Iryna Terekh, head of production at Fire Point.",
      "Terekh spoke as she surveyed dozens of \u201cdeep-strike drones\u201d that had recently come off the assembly line and would soon be used by Ukrainian forces to attack arms depots, oil refineries and other targets vital to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine and economy.",
      "Spurred by its existential fight against Russia \u2014 and limited military assistance from Western allies \u2014 Ukraine has fast become a global center for defense innovation. The goal is to match, if not outmuscle, Russia\u2019s capabilities \u2014 and Fire Point is one of the companies leading the way.",
      "The Associated Press was granted an exclusive look inside one of Fire Point\u2019s dozens of covert factories. In a sprawling warehouse where rock music blared, executives showed off their signature FP-1 exploding drones that can travel up to 1,600 kilometers (994 miles). They also touted publicly for the first time a cruise missile they are developing that is capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles), and which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes will be mass-produced by the end of the year.",
      "Even as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for an end to the 3 1/2-year war \u2014 and dangles the prospect of U.S. support for NATO-like security guarantees \u2014 Ukrainian defense officials say their country is determined to become more self-sufficient in deterring Russia.",
      "\u201cWe believe our best guarantee is not relying on somebody\u2019s will to protect us, but rather our ability to protect ourselves,\u201d said Arsen Zhumadilov, the head of the country's arms procurement agency.",
      "Ukraine's government is now purchasing about $10 billion of weapons annually from domestic manufacturers. The industry has the capacity to sell triple that amount, officials say, and they believe sales to European allies could help it reach such potential in a matter of years.",
      "Like most defense companies in Ukraine, Fire Point grew out of necessity after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Despite pleas from Ukrainian military officials, Western countries were unwilling to allow Kyiv to use their allies' longer-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.",
      "That's when a group of close friends, experts from various fields, set out to mass-produce inexpensive drones that could match the potency of Iranian-made Shahed drones that Russia was firing into Ukraine with devastating consequences.",
      "The company's founders spoke with AP on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their safety and the security of their factories.",
      "By pooling together knowledge from construction, game design and architecture, the company's founders \u2014 who had no background in defense \u2014 came up with novel designs for drones that could fly further and strike with greater precision than most products already on the market. Their long-range drones had another benefit: they did not need to take off from an air field.",
      "When Terekh \u2014 an architect \u2014 was hired in the summer of 2023, she was given a goal of producing 30 drones per month. Now the company makes roughly 100 per day, at a cost of $55,000 apiece.",
      "The FP-1 looks more like a hastily made science project than something that would roll off the production lines of the world's biggest defense contractors. \u201cWe removed unneeded, flashy glittery stuff,\u201d she said.",
      "But the FP-1 has been extremely effective on the battlefield.",

      "With a payload of explosives weighing 60 kilograms (132 pounds), it is responsible for 60% of strikes deep inside Russian territory, including hits on oil refineries and weapons depots, according to Terekh. These strikes have helped to slow Russia\u2019s advance along the 1,000 kilometer-long (620 mile-long) front line in eastern Ukraine, where army units have reported a sharp decline in artillery fire.",
      "\u201cI think the best drones, or among the best, are Ukrainian drones,\" said Claude Chenuil, a former French military official who now works for a trade group that focuses on defense. \u201cWhen the war in Ukraine ends, they will flood the market.\u201d",
      "Fire Point\u2019s story is not entirely unique. Soon after Russia's 2022 invasion, hundreds of defense companies sprouted almost overnight. The Ukrainian government incentivized innovation by relaxing regulations and making it easier for startups to work directly with military brigades.",
      "Patriotic entrepreneurs in metallurgy, construction and information technology built facilities for researching and making weapons and munitions, with an emphasis on drones. The ongoing war allowed them to test out ideas almost immediately on the battlefield, and to quickly adapt to Russia\u2019s changing tactics.",
      "\u201cUkraine is in this very unique moment now where it is becoming, de facto, the Silicon Valley of defense,\u201d said Ukrainian defense entrepreneur Yaroslav Azhnyuk. \u201cThe biggest strategic asset that we have is that we have been at war with Russia for 11 years.\u201d",
      "A case in point: Fire Point had initially sourced navigational equipment for its drones from a major Western firm, but before long Russia was able to disrupt their effectiveness using electronic warfare; so Fire Point developed its own software to outwit the enemy.",
      "Because defense companies are high-value targets for Russia, many operate underground or hidden within civilian centers to evade detection. Although they are guarded by air defenses, the strategy has the disadvantage of putting civilians at risk. Many Ukrainians have died in imprecise Russian attacks that were likely targeting weapons facilities. Entrepreneurs said the alternative is to operate openly and face attacks that would set back the war effort.",
      "On the day AP reporters visited the Fire Point factory, there were dozens of drones awaiting delivery. They would all be gone within 72 hours, shipped to the battlefield in inconspicuous cargo trucks.",
      "The Fire Point team receives regular feedback from army units, and the company has reinvested most profits toward innovating quickly to keep pace with other drone makers. Increasingly, those profits are being directed to develop a new, more potent weapon.",
      "The company completed testing this year for its first cruise missile, the FP-5. Capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and landing within 14 meters (45 feet) of its target, the FP-5 is one of the largest such missile in the world, delivering a payload of 1,150 kilograms (2,535 pounds), independent experts said. Because initial versions of the missile came out pink after a factory error, they called it the Flamingo \u2014 and the name has stuck.",
      "Fire Point is producing roughly one Flamingo per day, and by October they hope to build capacity to make seven per day, Terekh said.",
      "Even as Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials pursue ways to end the war, Terekh said she is skeptical that Russia will accept terms for a real peace. \u201cWe are preparing for a bigger, much scarier war.\u201d",

      "Bob Uecker\u2019s Hall of Fame broadcasting career began only after the Milwaukee Brewers initially hired him as a scout",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Bob Uecker's Hall of Fame broadcasting career began only after the Milwaukee Brewers initially hired him as a scout.",
      "Former Brewers owner and MLB Commissioner Bud Selig said it didn't take long to realize Uecker might be better suited for a different role.",
      "\u201cThe first scouting report Bob sent back here had mashed potatoes and gravy all over it,\u201d Selig recalled Sunday during a pregame ceremony honoring the man who broadcast Brewers games for 54 seasons, became a national celebrity for his trademark sense of humor and died Jan. 16 at the age of 90.",
      "The star-studded celebration was hosted by former NBC broadcast partner Bob Costas and featured Hall of Famers George Brett, Ted Simmons and Robin Yount as well as Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich.",
      "\u201cTo say he loved this team, this city, and this state would be an understatement,\u201d the Uecker family said in a statement. \u201cMilwaukee was his home, and the Brewers were an extension of his family. Seeing that love reflected back means more than we could ever put into words. There is something truly special about this community, and Bob felt it every single day.",
      "\u201cThank you for welcoming him into your lives, for making him part of your families, and for holding him in your hearts.\u201d",
      "All the Brewers players wore special tribute uniforms with \u201cUECK\u201d instead of their own names on the back of their jerseys for Sunday\u2019s game to honor the man who probably is more synonymous with the franchise than any particular player.",
      "The entire team joined Uecker\u2019s relatives behind the mound before Bob Uecker Jr. threw out the first pitch to Yount. The game featured commemorative baseballs and bases honoring Uecker.",
      "The celebration of life comes with the Brewers owning the best record in baseball as they chase their first World Series title.",
      "\u201cNobody would have enjoyed this more,\u201d principal owner Mark Attanasio said. \u201cI believe he\u2019s still with us, but I really miss him.\u201d",
      "American Family Field\u2019s broadcast wing above the press box was renamed the Bob Uecker Broadcast center. Uecker\u2019s name already appeared on a medallion alongside all the Brewers\u2019 retired numbers, but it was updated Sunday to include his name and a single microphone.",
      "Memorabilia including photos and various examples of his plaid sports coats were displayed all over the concourses.",
      "John Colson, a partial season ticket holder from Milwaukee, was already waiting outside the ballpark entrance well over 3 1/2 hours before first pitch.",
      "\u201cBob Uecker was my entire childhood,\u201d Colson said. \u201cJust memories of listening to the games on the radio, coming to the games. Bob Uecker\u2019s Mr. Baseball. He was Mr. Brewers. It\u2019s not the same without him.\u201d",
      "Colson wore a T-shirt with the message, \u201cJuuuust a bit outside,\u201d honoring Uecker\u2019s famous line as broadcaster Harry Doyle in the movie \u201cMajor League.\" Other fans in the sellout crowd wore plaid sport coats or Brewers jerseys with Uecker's name.",
      "Uecker also was beloved by players who treasured his regular appearances in the locker room to swap stories or offer encouragement.",

      "\u201cWhether it was your first day in the big leagues or you\u2019d been there for 10 years, he treated you as though you were his friend his entire life,\u201d Yelich said. \u201cI think that was one of his real gifts, making people feel like they were best friends and he\u2019d known them forever.\u201d",
      "That meant treating even a player coming up from the minors no differently than an American president.",
      "At a news conference before the pregame ceremony, Costas told the story of how former President Richard Nixon was watching a Brewers-Yankees game and asked Yankees owner George Steinbrenner if it would be possible to meet Uecker. After Uecker spoke to Nixon, broadcast partner Pat Hughes asked what it was like to meet the president.",
      "\u201cUeck says, \u2018You know, Richie\u2019s not a bad guy,\u2019\" Costas recalled.",
      "Uecker was best known nationally for the dry wit he showed on talk-show appearances with Johnny Carson and in the \u201cMajor League\u201d movies, Miller Lite commercials and the television show \u201cMr. Belvedere.\u201d Some of his \u201cMr. Belvedere\u201d and \u201cMajor League\u201d colleagues were on hand for this ceremony.",
      "But the people honoring him Sunday also paid tribute to his baseball knowledge.",
      "Although Uecker made his career .200 batting average a frequent target of his self-deprecating humor, Simmons said the broadcaster's status as a former backup catcher gave him remarkable perspective. After the Brewers acquired him before the 1981 season, Simmons said Uecker offered pointers on handling Milwaukee\u2019s pitching staff.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to tell me how these guys think, where they\u2019re at because they need help and I need help,\u2019\" Simmons said. \u201cThat\u2019s how we started out. From there, it was great.\u201d",
      "Costas and Selig said Uecker's broadcasting skills were underrated. Selig said it was a treat to listen to the ninth inning of Uecker\u2019s broadcasts in games the Brewers were winning.",
      "\u201cMost of the country outside of Wisconsin knows him from Johnny Carson and the \u2018Major League\u2019 films, but if he never said one thing that was funny and you just judged him as a baseball announcer \u2014 especially on the radio \u2014 Hall of Fame-caliber baseball announcer,\u201d Costas said.",
      "Costas specifically mentioned Uecker's final sign-off after the Brewers allowed four runs in the ninth inning of a 4-2 loss in the decisive game of their NL Wild Card Series loss to the New York Mets. Uecker, who had battled small cell lung cancer throughout last season, closed the broadcast by saying \u201cthat one had some sting on it.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen you hear Ueck signing off \u2014 he didn\u2019t always wear his heart on his sleeve \u2014 but it was so poignant,\u201d Costas said. \u201cHe was disappointed for the team because it was such a heartbreaking loss. But he also knew these were the last words he\u2019d ever speak as the voice of the Brewers, and his voice was not as strong, and he wasn\u2019t quite as sharp, but it was still Bob Uecker. When you listen to that, even though he doesn\u2019t frame it that way, that\u2019s about as poignant a valedictory as any broadcaster has ever given.\u201d",

      "\u201cI thought he had great leadership. He was in command. He didn't get rattled, made people miss and made the throws,\u201d Kansas coach Lance Leipold said of his quarterback. \u201cJust everything you want in that, and you've seen him play. He just seemed really confident in what's going on. And that's what you need out of an experienced quarterback.\u201d",
      "E.J. Warner had 179 yards passing with two interceptions for Fresno State. Elijah Gilliam had a touchdown run.",
      "This one had all the pomp and circumstance of a homecoming \u2014 and, well, it was one after the Jayhawks spent all of last season playing home games at stadiums in the Kansas City area. In the meantime, their 104-year-old stadium was razed and the majority of it was rebuilt, with only the east side where the students sit awaiting a facelift this coming offseason.",

      "The veteran left-hander produced six brilliant innings of one-hit ball while his San Diego Padres surged past Los Angeles into sole possession of first place in the NL West with a 5-1 victory.",
      "Cortes took a perfect game into the sixth inning, flummoxing the Dodgers' high-priced lineup and combining with three relievers on a two-hitter. But he didn't see this stellar performance as redemption for his role in Freeman's now-iconic slam at Chavez Ravine and the Dodgers' ensuing five-game victory over his New York Yankees.",
      "\u201cObviously there\u2019s a history,\u201d Cortes said. \u201cEverybody knows about it. It (stinks) as a player to go through those moments, but the good thing about baseball is that you always have another opportunity. Once the opportunity comes, you try and make the best out of it, and that\u2019s what I did today.\u201d",
      "With a sellout crowd at Petco Park cheering him on in just his fourth start for the Padres, Cortes coolly retired the Dodgers' first 16 hitters. He struck out three and didn't walk a batter while slicing through Los Angeles' collection of MVPs and standout role players with a crafty mix of pitches \u2014 and nothing faster than 92.1 mph.",
      "\u201cThat was tremendous,\u201d Padres manager Mike Shildt said. \u201cWe're getting to know him, and it just feels like once he gets in a rhythm, he's really good. He got in a rhythm right from the very first batter, and he just carried it through. It was a fantastic effort through six.\u201d",
      "The Dodgers couldn't even get on base until Miguel Rojas got a one-out single in the sixth. Cortes calmly regrouped, retiring Shohei Ohtani for the third time on a flyball to end the inning and his night.",
      "The performance was even more impressive because Cortes is still getting to know his teammates and coaches with the Padres, who acquired him from Milwaukee at the July 31 trade deadline in a flurry of moves that have significantly improved an already strong roster.",

      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark.",
      "The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d",
      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen like Clough who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Atlantic Canada are learning to live with great white sharks, the creatures made famous by the 1975 film \u201cJaws.\u201d Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted.",
      "Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. The sharks can grow close to 20 feet (6 meters) long, though most don't get that big.",
      "David Lancaster, a commercial clam digger in Scarborough, used a drone to get a look at an approximately 12-foot (3.6-meter) shark near the town\u2019s famed beaches earlier this month. He described the animal as \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201creally amazing\u201d to see. But he also said the shark's presence reminded him that swimmers need to look out for the big fish.",
      "Sightings of great whites off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have become increasingly frequent in recent years, and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has documented hundreds of the animals over more than a decade. But new data shows the sharks are heading even farther north into New Hampshire, Maine and beyond, said Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and a veteran white shark researcher.",
      "The number of white sharks detected off Halifax, Nova Scotia, increased about 2.5 times from 2018 to 2022, according to a paper published by Skomal and others in May in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. Even farther north, the number detected in the Cabot Strait that separates Nova Scotia and Newfoundland increased nearly four times over, the paper said.",
      "Skomal said the average residency in these northern waters has also increased from 48 days to 70 days, suggesting that white sharks appear to be increasingly comfortable farther north.",
      "A key reason for the shift seems to be the successful conservation of seals off New England and Canada via laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has allowed seals to thrive and provide a food source for the predatory sharks, Skomal said.",
      "\u201cIt could be a function of a growing prey base,\u201d Skomal said. \u201cAnd that would be seals.\u201d",
      "Great white sharks also benefit from protections, including a ban on fishing for them in U.S. federal waters that has stood since 1997. They are still considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.",
      "In Massachusetts, the marine fisheries department said it strengthened its fishing laws after fishermen in 2024 chose to target white sharks anyway. The state prohibited the use of certain kinds of heavy fishing gear in shoreline areas where white sharks are most commonly found.",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration",
      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.",
      "Huang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest chip maker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \"That\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d",
      "Such chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.",
      "The B30A, based on California-based Nvidia's specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia's main B300 chips.",
      "Huang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.",
      "As part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.",

      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\u201cI said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe agreed, and they\u2019ve agreed to do it.\u201d",

      "The official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden.

The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan\u2019s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.

      "The company isn\u2019t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel\u2019s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration\u2019s financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company\u2019s chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",

      "BANGKOK -- China released new interim measures Friday tightening controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets.",
      "The rules released Friday by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology apply both to rare earths originating in China and those that are sent to China for refining.",

But they're hard to find in a high enough concentration to make mining them worth the investment. China has been gradually tightening restrictions on exports of such materials, partly in response to U.S. controls on its access to American advanced technology.",
      "In April, just after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a raft of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, Beijing announced permitting requirements for seven more rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",

And then the body still needs to keep working. So it starts breaking down less essential parts of the body. So you see, like, people become very thin.\u201d",
      "In a sense, he said, people\u2019s muscles are being eaten by their own bodies to keep them going.",

      "When a famine is declared, governments and the international aid community, including the U.N., can potentially unlock aid and funding to help feed people en masse.",
      "Because this famine is human-caused, \u201cit can be halted and reversed,\" the IPC report said. \u201cThe time for debate and hesitation has passed, starvation is present and is rapidly spreading.\u201d",

      "Hurricane Erin is creating potentially deadly water conditions all along the U.S. East Coast days before the largest waves are expected, with high winds and waves anticipated in North Carolina by Wednesday night.",
      "Erin lost some strength Tuesday and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane as it moves northward roughly parallel to the East Coast. However it could get stronger again on Thursday before finally weakening by Friday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) as of Wednesday morning.",
      "The hurricane was about 400 miles (640 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and 560 miles ( 901 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda as of Wednesday morning. Forecasters said Erin was moving north-northwest at 13 mph (21 kph).",
      "Although the weather center was confident Erin would not make direct landfall in the United States, authorities have warned that water conditions along the East Coast remain dangerous. Beachgoers were cautioned against swimming due to life-threatening surf and rip currents.",
      "Officials on a few islands along North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks issued evacuation orders and warned that some roads could be swamped by waves of 15 feet (4.6 meters).",
      "In the Caribbean, heavy rainfall was forecast for parts of the southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, the weather center said.",
      "Here is what to know about Hurricane Erin:",
      "Erin poses the biggest threat to the barrier islands of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency Tuesday in advance of the storm, delegating powers to government officials to mobilize workers and equipment along the coast.",
      "The governor said the storm is expected to bring tropical storm force winds, dangerous waves and rip currents to the state. Tropical storm conditions were expected to begin Wednesday.",
      "At least 75 people were rescued from rip currents through Tuesday in Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, North Carolina, officials said.",
      "Evacuations were ordered on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks. The orders come at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that juts far into the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "There are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway running along the barrier islands, the National Weather Service said. Some routes could be impassible for several days.",
      "Warnings about rip currents have been posted from Bermuda and Florida all the way up to the New England coast.",
      "Nantucket is the closest spot in New England to Erin\u2019s anticipated path and was likely to see the strongest winds, gusting about 25 to 35 mph (40 to 55 kph) at peak with waves potentially reaching a height of 10-13 feet (3-4 meters).",
      "Citing treacherous waters, officials prohibited swimming at all beaches in New York City as well as some in Long Island and New Jersey through Thursday.",
      "Bermuda won\u2019t feel the full intensity of the storm until Thursday evening, and the island\u2019s services will remain open in the meantime, acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said. Storm surge could reach up to 24 feet (7.3 meters) by Thursday, Adams said.",

      "Erin reached a dangerous Category 5 status late last week with 160 mph (260 kph) winds before weakening.",
      "Although Erin is the first Atlantic hurricane of the year, there have been four tropical storms this hurricane season already. Tropical Storm Chantal made the first U.S. landfall of the season in early July, and its remnants caused flooding in North Carolina that killed an 83-year-old woman when her car was swept off a rural road.",

    "story": [
      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results. Similarly, they haven't accused Los Angeles County officials of wrongdoing, or said whether they were even aware of the alleged bribery scheme. County officials say they weren\u2019t.",
      "But the case against Pinate is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Fox says it was legitimately reporting newsworthy allegations.",
      "Smartmatic said the Justice Department\u2019s new filing was filled with \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and is \u201cuntethered from reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we\u2019re the best at what we do,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.\u201d",
      "Still, Fox has gone to court to try to get more information about L.A. County's dealings with Smartmatic. The network has long tried to leverage the bribery allegations to undermine Smartmatic\u2019s narrative about its business prospects \u2013 a key component in calculating any potential damages \u2014 and portray it as a scandal-plagued company brought low by its own legal problems, not Fox's broadcasts.",
      "South Florida-based Smartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success working for the government of the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.",
      "It was awarded its contract to help with Los Angeles County elections in 2018. The contract, which Smartmatic continues to service, gave the company an important foothold in what was then a fast-expanding U.S. voting-technology market.",
      "But Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.",
      "Fox itself eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers complained, but it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York.",
      "\u201cFacing imminent financial collapse and indictment, Smartmatic saw a litigation lottery ticket in Fox News\u2019s coverage of the 2020 election,\u201d the network\u2019s lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Smartmatic has disputed Fox's characterization in court filings as \u201clies\u201d and \u201canother attempt to divert attention from its long-standing campaign of falsehoods and defamation.\"",

      "Fox's lawyers also questioned Logan in a deposition about a dinner a Smartmatic executive bought for him at the members-only Magic Castle club and restaurant in Los Angeles and a Smartmatic-paid trip that Logan made to Taiwan in 2019 to oversee the manufacturing of equipment by a Smartmatic vendor. U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines. The five-day trip included business class airfare, hotel and numerous meals as well as time for sightseeing, Fox said.",
      "\u201cThe trip\u2019s itinerary demonstrates that the trip was not a financial inspection or audit. It was a boondoggle,\u201d Fox said in court filings.",
      "Logan, who did not report the gifts in his financial disclosures, said in his 2023 deposition that the meal at the Magic Castle was a \u201csocial occasion\u201d unrelated to business and that he was not required to report the trip to Taiwan because his visit was covered by the contract.",
      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing. Logan's spouse accompanied him on the trip, but at the couple's own expense, the spokesman added.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this is an attempt to use the County as a pawn in two serious legal actions to which the County is not a party,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "Smartmatic has settled two other defamation lawsuits it brought against conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network over their 2020 U.S. election coverage. Settlement terms weren\u2019t disclosed.",
      "U.S. prosecutors in Miami have also accused Pinate of secretly bribing Venezuela's longtime election chief by giving her a luxury home with a pool in Caracas. Prosecutors say the home was transferred to the election chief in an attempt to repair relations following Smartmatic's abrupt exit from Venezuela in 2017 when it accused President Nicolas Maduro 's government of manipulating tallied results in elections for a rubber-stamping constituent assembly.",
      "Smartmatic has denied the bribery allegations, saying it ceased all operations in Venezuela in 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again.",
      "\"There are no slush funds, no gifted house,\" the company said. Instead, it accused Fox of engaging in \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and attempts to use \u201cfrivolous\u201d court filings \u201cto smear us further, twisting unproven Justice Department allegations.\u201d",

      "Minnesota has joined a wave of states suing TikTok, claiming the app uses addictive algorithms that harm young people's mental health",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota on Tuesday joined a wave of states suing TikTok, alleging the social media giant preys on young people with addictive algorithms that trap them into becoming compulsive consumers of its short videos.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free speech. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna holler that,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference. \"It\u2019s actually about deception, manipulation, misrepresentation. This is about a company knowing the dangers, and the dangerous effects of its product, but making and taking no steps to mitigate those harms or inform users of the risks.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in state court, alleges that TikTok is violating Minnesota laws against deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud. It follows a flurry of lawsuits filed by more than a dozen states last year alleging the popular short-form video app is designed to be addictive to kids and harms their mental health. Minnesota's case brings the total to about 24 states, Ellison's office said.",
      "Many of the earlier lawsuits stemmed from a nationwide investigation into TikTok launched in 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from 14 states into the effects of TikTok on young users\u2019 mental health. Ellison, a Democrat, said Minnesota waited while it did its own investigation.",
      "Sean Padden, a middle-school health teacher in the Roseville Area school district, joined Ellison, saying he has witnessed a correlation between increased TikTok use and an \u201cirrefutable spike in student mental health issues,\u201d including depression, anxiety, anger, lowered self-esteem and a decrease in attention spans as they seek out the quick gratification that its short videos offer.",
      "The lawsuit comes while President Donald Trump is still trying to broker a deal to bring the social media platform, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, under American ownership over concerns about the data security of its 170 million American users. While Trump campaigned on banning TikTok, he also gained more than 15 million followers on the platform since he started sharing videos on it.",
      "No matter who ultimately owns TikTok, Ellison said, it must comply with the law.",

      "TikTok disputed Minnesota's allegations.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit is based on misleading and inaccurate claims that fail to recognize the robust safety measures TikTok has voluntarily implemented to support the well-being of our community,\" company spokesperson Nathaniel Brown said in a statement. \"Teen accounts on TikTok come with 50+ features and settings designed to help young people safely express themselves, discover and learn.",
      "\"Through our Family Pairing tool, parents can view or customize 20+ content and privacy settings, including screen time, content filters, and our time away feature to pause a teen\u2019s access to our app,\u201d Brown added.",
      "Minnesota is seeking a declaration that TikTok's practices are deceptive, unfair or unconscionable under state law, a permanent injunction against those practices, and up to $25,000 for each instance in which a Minnesota child has accessed TikTok. Ellison wouldn't put a total on that but said, \u201cit's a lot.\u201d He estimated that \u201chundreds of thousands of Minnesota kids\u201d have TikTok on their devices.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to shut them down, but we are insisting that they clean up their act,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThere are legitimate uses of products like TikTok. But like all things, they have to be used properly and safely.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is also among dozens of U.S. states that have sued Meta Platforms for allegedly building features into Instagram and Facebook that addict people. The messaging service Snapchat and the gaming platform Roblox are also facing lawsuits by some other states alleging harm to kids.",

      "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker. If the goal is realized, the investment would deepen the Trump administration's involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up the pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.",
      "The Trump administration is in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "That's what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn't commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",

By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d Lutnick told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201d",

      "As students start school this year, 17 states and the District of Columbia are imposing new cellphone restrictions",
      "Jamel Bishop is seeing a big change in his classrooms as he begins his senior year at Doss High School in Louisville, Kentucky, where cellphones are now banned during instructional time.",
      "In previous years, students often weren\u2019t paying attention and wasted class time by repeating questions, the teenager said. Now, teachers can provide \u201cmore one-on-one time for the students who actually need it.\u201d",
      "Kentucky is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia starting this school year with new restrictions, bringing the total to 35 states with laws or rules limiting phones and other electronic devices in school. This change has come remarkably quickly: Florida became the first state to pass such a law in 2023.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have taken up the cause, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are bad for kids' mental health and take their focus away from learning, even as some researchers say the issue is less clear-cut.",
      "\u201cAnytime you have a bill that\u2019s passed in California and Florida, you know you\u2019re probably onto something that\u2019s pretty popular,\" Georgia state Rep. Scott Hilton, a Republican, told a forum on cellphone use last week in Atlanta.",
      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",
      "That resentment is \u201cstarting to ease down\u201d now, she said. \"More students are willing to give up their phones and not get distracted.\u201d",
      "But there are drawbacks \u2014 like not being able to listen to music when working independently in class. \u201cI\u2019m kind of 50-50 on the situation because me, I use headphones to do my schoolwork. I listen to music to help focus,\u201d she said.",
      "In a survey of 125 Georgia school districts by Emory University researchers, parental resistance was cited as the top obstacle to regulating student use of social and digital media.",
      "Johnson\u2019s mother, Audrena Johnson, said she worries most about knowing her children are safe from violence at school. School messages about threats can be delayed and incomplete, she said, like when someone who wasn\u2019t a McNair student got into a fight on school property, which she learned about when her daughter texted her during the school day.",
      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

      "\u201cThey could focus more on teaching,\u201d Gazmararian said. \u201cThere were just not the disruptions.\u201d",
      "Another benefit: More positive interactions among students. \u201cThey were saying that kids are talking to each other in the hallways and in the cafeteria,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the classroom, there is a noticeably lower amount of discipline referrals.\u201d",
      "Gazmararian is still compiling numbers on grades and discipline, and cautioned that her work may not be able to answer whether bullying has been reduced or mental health improved.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for the media giant Meta says a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, should be thrown out",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A lawsuit filed by families of the Uvalde school shooting victims alleging Instagram allowed gun manufacturers to promote firearms to minors should be thrown out, lawyers for Meta, Instagram's parent company, argued Tuesday.",
      "Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the May 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.",
      "The families sued Meta in Los Angeles in May 2024, saying the social media platform failed to enforce its own rules forbidding firearms advertisements aimed at minors. The families, who were present at last month's hearing, did not appear in court, with a lawyer citing the back-to-school season. Many plaintiffs attended the hearing virtually, he said.",
      "In one ad posted on Instagram, the Georgia-based gunmaker Daniel Defense shows Santa Claus holding an assault rifle. In another post by the same company, a rifle leans against a refrigerator, with the caption: \u201cLet\u2019s normalize kitchen Daniels. What Daniels do you use to protect your kitchen and home?\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges those posts are marketed toward minors. The Uvalde gunman opened an online account with Daniel Defense before his 18th birthday and purchased the rifle as soon as he could, according to the lawsuit. He also owned various Instagram accounts and had an \u201cobsessive relationship\u201d with the platform, at times opening the app more than 100 times a day, plaintiffs' lawyers found in an analysis of the shooter's phone.",
      "Meta attorney Kristin Linsley argued that the families provided no proof that minors, including the Uvalde gunman, even read the Daniel Defense posts on Instagram. She also said the posts didn't violate Meta\u2019s policies because they weren\u2019t direct advertisements and did not include links to purchase any products.",
      "Katie Mesner-Hage, representing the victims' families, said the defense\u2019s claim is \u201cfundamentally unfair,\u201d as the plaintiffs don\u2019t have access to Meta data that would indicate whether the shooter encountered those posts. She added that if the content had landed on the shooter\u2019s feed, as the plaintiffs allege, then Meta \u201cnot only knew about it, they designed the system so it would be delivered to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey knew more about him than anyone else on the planet,\u201d she said.",
      "Linsley said content advertising firearms for sale on Instagram is allowed if posted by \u201cbrick-and-motor and online retailers,\u201d but visibility of those posts was restricted for minors under Meta\u2019s advertising policies from the end of 2021 to October 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is not a playbook for how to violate the rules. This is actually what the rules are,\u201d Linsley said.",
      "The plaintiff\u2019s team, however, showed a fake profile they created for a 17-year-old boy earlier this month, through which they were able to search Daniel Defense\u2019s Instagram account and see a post that included a picture of a gun, as well as a link to the gun manufacturer\u2019s website.",
      "When the link was clicked, the gun-maker\u2019s website opened, and the team was able to select a firearm and add it to their cart, all within Instagram\u2019s app \u2014 an experiment that refutes Meta\u2019s assertion that posts relating to firearms aren\u2019t visible to users under 21, Mesner-Hage said.",

      "The families have also sued Daniel Defense and video game company Activision, which produces \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d",
      "Linsley said the Communications Decency Act allows social media platforms to moderate content without being treated as publishers of that content.",
      "\"The only response a company can have is to not have these kinds of rules at all,\" Linsley said. \u201cIt just gets you down a rabbit hole very quickly.\u201d",
      "Mesner-Hage argued Meta is not protected by the act because social media platforms don\u2019t just host speech, but help curate it through its algorithms. Daniel Defense, she said, didn't have to pay for ads to get free access to Meta's analytical data through its business account on Instagram. That data shows the company which age bracket and gender engaged most with a specific post.",
      "\u201cDaniel Defense is not on Instagram to make friends. ... They\u2019re on there to promote their product,\u201d Mesner-Hage said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a paid advertisement, but I would struggle to describe this as anything other than an advertisement.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges that firearm companies tweaked their online marketing to comply with Meta's policies, including by avoiding the words \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201csell\u201d and not providing links to purchase, and that the social media company did not protect users against such strategies.",
      "Last month, lawyers for Activision also argued that legal proceedings against them should be thrown out, saying the families allegations are barred by the First Amendment. The families alleged that the war-themed video game Call of Duty trained and conditioned the Uvalde gunman to orchestrate his attack.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs asked the judge to allow them to amend their lawsuit with the new information they presented Tuesday before ruling on the defense\u2019s motion. The defense claimed that was unnecessary, as the case would not have merit even with the amendments.",
      "The judge has yet to rule on Activision's motion and did not immediately rule on the Meta case.",

      "The vice president was pressed on why he believes Russia wants to pursue peace given that it has rejected the ceasefire proposal that Trump put forward and that there's no planned meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.",
      "\"Well, I didn't say they conceded on everything,\" he replied. \"But what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They've recognized that they're not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And importantly, they've acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine.\"",

      "Hurricane Katrina changed New Orleans' education system forever, creating the first all-charter school district in the U.S. The Associated Press spoke with three survivors about their experiences",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- Twenty years ago, Hurricane Katrina changed the face of education in New Orleans forever. The school system was utterly destroyed and then utterly transformed, becoming the first and only all-charter school district in the country.",
      "Ahead of the storm's anniversary, The Associated Press asked three survivors to reflect on what it was like to be a student or a teacher during that tumultuous period.",
      "For some, connections they developed with educators who helped them through the crisis inspired careers as teachers. Their experiences also offer lessons for teachers and schools going through natural disasters today.",
      "What follows are the educators\u2019 accounts in their own words, condensed for publication.",
      "1. Chris Dier, a history teacher at Benjamin Franklin High School in New Orleans, was just starting his senior year of high school in neighboring Chalmette when Katrina hit. He evacuated to a hotel, then a shelter for Katrina survivors in Texas.",

      "I remember waking up to my Aunt Tina banging on the hotel door. I remember she said, \u2018There are hundreds of bodies everywhere,\u2019 that the levees broke. I\u2019ll never forget getting that knock on the door that let me know that everything has changed, that everything is different.",
      "There was an elderly couple that came to the shelter and talked with us, and they offered us their trailer so we could actually have a space to live. We stayed in that trailer for the remainder of the year, and I finished my high school in Texas, Henderson High School.",
      "One of the reasons I wanted to become a teacher was because of how these teachers treated us at our lowest points. I remember Coach Propes, the soccer coach who got us soccer cleats and took care of us in that way. I remember Mrs. Rains, the English teacher who had us in our class and had all the supplies ready. I remember Ms. Pellon, the Spanish teacher who also had supplies for us. Mr. McGinnis, he would come in in the early hours to tutor me in chemistry because I missed weeks of school.",
      "They made me feel welcome. They made me feel like I belong. They made me feel that I was part of a larger community, as opposed to just a statistic.",
      "The last thing I wanted to do growing up was be a teacher, because I saw how my mom was a teacher and all the time and effort she put into her craft. She would be cooking with her left hand and grading papers with her right hand. I wanted more in life. But Katrina changed me in that way, because I saw how these teachers responded.",
      "Everything we talk about is \u2018before Katrina\u2019 and \u2018after Katrina.\u2019 Now I have \u2018before COVID\u2019 and \u2018after COVID.\u2019 I started seeing the parallels right away, right when the schools closed down, March 16 (in 2020). The questions that (students) had, those same questions I had after we evacuated during Hurricane Katrina. I remember thinking, \u2018Are we really never coming back to school?\u2019",
      "I went home that weekend and wrote an open letter to seniors, offering some support and advice. I wrote about what it\u2019s like to lose your senior year. I said that folks will downplay the situation, because they don\u2019t know what it feels like to have their senior year stripped. But I do know. I try to tell them that they\u2019re not forgotten: Teachers are thinking of them. We care for them.",

      "We decided after watching the news on Friday, to leave Saturday. I just remember being on the highway forever. Literally forever. I lived with my brother and my sister-in-law during that time, because my mother had passed away when I was 12, in 2003. We were heading to Alexandria, where my sister-in-law is from. I just remember being hungry for a long time.",
      "It was devastating to see what all was taking place in New Orleans on national TV during this time. When you saw the large amount of people, the impact of the water and the flooding and the damage that was done because of the wind, it was like: Oh, we\u2019re going to be in Alexandria a while.",

      "I was not performing academically at the level that I had normally been in New Orleans. Just trying to stay afloat in my classes was a struggle. The teachers didn\u2019t really go out of their way. They were strictly, like, \u2018This is the lesson, this is the material, this is when the test is.\u2019 I just didn\u2019t get the love and attention that I was accustomed to in New Orleans.",
      "I came back to New Orleans in March or April. It felt good to be back home. I had my friend base from middle school. I had friends from elementary school. I was back amongst family and elders, like my grandma, my auntie, my cousins, everybody. We lived 10, 15 minutes within each other, which is really good. We had neighborhood-based schooling, you know, prior to Katrina.",
      "It changed the trajectory of my life. I did not want to always become an educator. With my mother passing away, it was school that grounded me. It was the teachers and leaders inside of those school buildings that supported me, pushed me and encouraged me.",
      "I had some pivotal educators in my life who played a big role in my education and my journey. In return, I felt like I could do that for other children of New Orleans.

      "NEW YORK -- A ban on assault weapons that Connecticut put in place after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is constitutional, a federal appeals court said Friday, as it rejected challenges by gun rights advocates who claim it violates the Second Amendment.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said groups challenging a 2013 law banning assault weapons and a second gun control law enacted a decade later could not show that the guns they are still able to possess, including several semi-automatic handguns, are not sufficient for self-defense purposes.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said public interest favors allowing the ban.",
      "The appeals court said the Second Amendment lets legislators implement targeted regulations designed to protect residents and their children from experiencing tragedies like the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that claimed 26 lives.",
      "The ruling came at an early stage for two lawsuits brought by individuals and gun rights groups. It upheld a Connecticut judge's ruling that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood that they would win their challenge to block enforcement of the laws while the lawsuits proceed.",
      "The appeals court said the proliferation of unusually dangerous weapons has \u201cled to a frequent, growing, and extremely lethal threat to public safety, actual and widely perceived\u201d that the authors of the Constitution could not have imagined.",
      "\u201cAnd such incidents remain distressingly frequent,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Founders faced no problem comparable to a single gunman carrying out a mass murder in seconds.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration has been pushing for the death penalty, but judges are blocking attempts to reverse previous decisions against capital punishment",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- President Donald Trump's administration is faltering in its aggressive pursuit of the death penalty as it revisits cases in which predecessors explicitly decided against seeking capital punishment.",
      "Since taking office in February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has authorized prosecutors to seek the death penalty against 19 people, including nine defendants in cases in which President Joe Biden's administration had sought lesser sentences. But judges have blocked those reversal attempts for all but two defendants, most recently on Monday in a pair of cases in the U.S. Virgin Islands, showing the limits of the Trump administration's power to undo decisions in cases already well underway.",
      "In pursuing capital punishment, the Justice Department is seeking to follow through on a Trump campaign promise to resume federal executions after they were halted by Biden\u2019s Attorney General Merrick Garland. The Republican president's Justice Department has accused the previous Democratic administration of supplanting \u201cthe will of the people with their own personal beliefs\u201d in failing to seek death sentences in many cases involving horrific crimes.",
      "Detailed opinions haven't been issued in the most recent two cases, which involve a man accused of killing a police officer in 2022 and two men accused of armed robbery and murder in 2018. But other judges who have rejected reversal attempts on constitutional and procedural grounds were blunt in their assessment of the Trump administration\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cThe government has proceeded hastily in this case, and in doing so has leapfrogged important constitutional and statutory rights,\" Trump appointee U.S. Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland wrote in June, striking the notice of intent to seek the death penalty against three alleged MS-13 gang members accused of killing two teenage girls in 2020. \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Authorization of capital prosecution typically occurs years before trial, but in the Maryland case, prosecutors filed the death penalty notice less than four months before the trial was scheduled to start. None of the defendants were represented by attorneys who specialize in death penalty litigation, which they would have been entitled to under federal law due to the complexity of capital cases and the potential consequences.",
      "\u201cThe government does not hide the ball here \u2014 the only reason for its flip-flop on the death penalty was the change in administration,\u201d wrote Gallagher, who called the government\u2019s \u201cwillful blindness\u201d to the differences between capital and non-capital trials \u201cstartling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis court will not cast aside decades of law, professional standards, and norms to accommodate the government\u2019s pursuit of its agenda,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOf course, elections have consequences, and this administration is entitled to pursue the death penalty in cases where it can do so in accordance with constitutional and statutory requirements. But this is not one of them.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors in Maryland and in a Nevada case declined to comment, but in court documents they argued that the Justice Department has an \u201cinherent power\u201d to reconsider previous decisions and that the timing of the death notice was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d given that the defendants had years to prepare for trial.",
      "\u201cThe Attorney General has simply reconsidered an earlier decision, which it is her prerogative to do so, and exercising that inherent authority is not misconduct but basic management and governance,\u201d wrote Maryland\u2019s U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes. \u201cAt no point did the Government make an enforceable promise. Deciding not to seek certain charges is not a promise not to do so.\u201d",
      "Trump, whose first administration carried out a record-setting 13 federal executions, signed an order on his first day back in the White House compelling the Justice Department to seek the death penalty in appropriate federal cases and support capital punishment in states. Bondi, who has said she will seek the death penalty \u201cwhenever possible,\u201d quickly lifted a Biden-era moratorium on federal executions and ordered a review of decisions made by the previous administration.",

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under terms set by the department, said roughly 1,400 decisions not to seek the death penalty were issued by Garland, with all but 459 having already been fully adjudicated by the time Trump took office.",
      "Bondi isn\u2019t the first attorney general to review past cases: Not only did Garland authorize just one death penalty case during his tenure, he also withdrew 35 notices of intent to seek the death penalty issued by his predecessors. The Justice Department says the Bondi-ordered review was essentially \u201cthe flip side\u201d of Garland's action and was the right thing to do to ensure consistency and achieve justice for victims and their families.",
      "But Robin Maher, executive of the Death Penalty Information Center, said while the Biden administration\u2019s actions reflected declining public support for the death penalty, Trump has brushed that aside.",
      "\u201cSo his enthusiasm for use of the death penalty is different not only from President Biden\u2019s more cautious approach, it\u2019s different from every other president\u2019s approach in history,\u201d said Maher, whose organization doesn\u2019t take a position on capital punishment but is critical of how it is used.",
      "Whether the reversals will stand remains a question in two of the cases. In the others, courts have sided with defendants who said they reasonably relied on assurances made by the previous administration. In court documents, lawyers for some of the defendants said they would have pursued plea bargains or objected to postponing trial dates had they known the death penalty decision would be reversed.",
      "\u201cIn some of these cases, very different paths were taken when those assurances were given,\u201d Maher said.",
      "In Nevada, prosecutors notified Cory Spurlock of their intention to seek the death penalty just 12 days before he was set to go on trial for the 2021 deaths of a California couple. Striking down that notice in May, Judge Miranda Du said the government fell far short of justifying its \u201cwholesale reversal at the eleventh hour.\u201d The trial began this week after prosecutors withdrew their appeal of her ruling.",
      "\u201cThe government decided \u2014 certainly not by inadvertence or accident \u2014 to reverse course on an issue of critical importance, involving Spurlock\u2019s life, less than two weeks before trial, with full knowledge that the reversal would have a chaotic impact on the progression of this case and would make it impossible to proceed to trial on the scheduled date,\u201d wrote Du, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. \u201cUnder the circumstances, this is certainly tantamount to playing \u2018fast and loose\u2019 with the Court\u2019s orders in particular and the judicial process in general.\u201d",

      "The former Trump national security adviser whose home and office are being searched by federal agents has been a vocal critic of the Republican president",
      "John Bolton, whose home and office were searched by federal agents on Friday, has been one of the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump since serving as a national security adviser in Trump's first administration.",
      "After serving in the White House, Bolton wrote a scathing book that portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy. FBI agents' searches of Bolton\u2019s Maryland home and Washington office, purportedly part of an investigation into the handling of classified information, raise the question of possible future actions against critics of the Republican president who have voiced their opinions.",
      "Bolton was not detained and has not been charged with any crimes, a person not authorized to discuss the investigation by name told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Here's more information on Bolton, a Republican and foreign policy hawk:",
      "Bolton served as Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, appointed in 2018 after Trump dismissed H.R. McMaster.",
      "Bolton's 17-month tenure was rife with clashes over countries including North Korea and Iran, with him voicing skepticism over Trump's outreach toward and summit with Kim Jong Un. On Iran, Bolton backed Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal but favored regime change and was frustrated when Trump called off a planned military strike in 2019.",
      "Those rifts ultimately led to Bolton's departure, with Trump announcing on social media in September 2019 that he had accepted Bolton's resignation.",
      "Bolton's 2020 book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened,\u201d painted an unvarnished portrait of Trump and his administration, amounting to the most vivid first-person account at the time of how Trump conducts himself in office. The 577-page book portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy, with Bolton writing that the president \u201csaw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.\u201d",
      "Bolton wrote that while he was at the White House, Trump typically had only two intelligence briefings a week \u201cand in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand.\u201d",
      "On Ukraine, Bolton alleged that Trump directly tied providing military aid to the country\u2019s willingness to conduct investigations into Joe Biden, soon-to-be Trump's Democratic 2020 election rival, and members of his family. In one conversation, Trump said \u201che wasn\u2019t in favor of sending them anything until all the Russia-investigation materials related to Clinton and Biden had been turned over,\u201d Bolton wrote.",
      "Bolton also wrote that he felt \u201chard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by re-election calculations,\" noting how Trump \u201cpleaded\u201d with China\u2019s Xi Jinping during a 2019 summit to help his reelection prospects.",
      "Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a \u201cwashed-up guy\u201d and a \u201ccrazy\u201d war-monger who would have led the country into \u201cWorld War Six.\u201d Trump also said at the time that the book contained \u201chighly classified information\" and that Bolton \u201cdid not have approval\u201d for publishing it.",
      "The White House worked furiously to block the book, unsuccessfully asking a federal court for an emergency temporary restraining order against its release.",
      "In an interview that aired Wednesday on NPR, Bolton said little has changed in bringing an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, pointing to Trump\u2019s efforts to secure a Nobel Peace Prize as the president's motivation to end the conflict.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication at all that Russia has in any way changed its objective, which is to bring Ukraine into the greater Russian Empire,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cNor is there any real sign that Zelenskyy is prepared to do the sorts of things that Russia has demanded of President Trump, such as ceding a substantial part of the Donetsk Oblast or province, which the Russians have not yet been able to conquer militarily.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Bolton posted to X that \u201cPutin\u2019s KGB training and flattery campaign is working Trump over, as seen by Trump\u2019s statement recently about how Ukraine shouldn\u2019t have taken the war on. It\u2019s important to remember: Ukraine didn\u2019t take anything on, they were invaded.\u201d",

Following a meeting with Bolton at Trump Tower, Trump told confidants that the hawk\u2019s trademark mustache would never be a fit in his administration, although he kept an admiring eye on Bolton\u2019s frequent cable TV appearances, during which he often defended the policies of the president even when they ran counter to what he had preached for decades.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has dropped an investigation into a buy now, pay later company with close ties to President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., saying the investigation was conducted in a biased manner and based off politics.",
      "The CFPB on Tuesday notified Credova Financial, a subsidiary of Public Square Holdings, where Trump Jr. is a board member and investor, that it was no longer under investigation. Public Square is a directory of businesses that sell American-made products, including financing for firearms and family pets, that market to conservative-leaning customers. Credova provides buy now, pay later services to Trump Jr.\u2019s GrabAGun firearms marketplace, which went public this year.",
      "The agency says the investigation, initiated during Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, was politically motivated against firearms companies and Trump Jr. However, the company has a record of dozens if not hundreds of consumer complaints and settlements over state consumer protection violations.",
      "The closure of the investigation also comes when the CFPB, a watchdog agency that helps oversee the nation\u2019s banks and financial services companies, has been undoing rulemaking, dropping other cases and ending law enforcement work that was done under previous administrations, including Trump's first term.",
      "The CFPB in Trump's second term determined the Credova investigation \u201cexemplifies the type of weaponization against disfavored industries and individuals\" that Trump and the agency's acting director, Russell Vought, are committed to ending, according to a letter sent to the chief counsel of Public Square Holdings.

      "\u201cThese spaces really help to filter our air and they lower our temperature,\" White said.",
      "But these spaces, like one in the Jamaica section of Queens with its abundant greenery, aren't just an area to cool down or find shade. They are a place where community can grow. White said you can often find residents and volunteers sitting down for conversation, finding a quiet space to read a book, studying for school and growing their own food.",
      "\u201cIn a place like New York, we are called the concrete jungle, (some) people don\u2019t have access to green spaces at all,\u201d White said.",
      "With increasing temperatures and development patterns, experts say its only going to get hotter, unless something is done. Some are using data as a way to alert communities to the growing dangers.",
      "For example, Kevin Lanza, an assistant professor of environmental sciences at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health in Austin, is helping cities mitigate heat exposure at bus stops. Because Texas's communities of color rely heavily on public transportation systems, this increases their exposure to heat, Lanza said.",
      "In 2019, Lanza's study found that the hottest days saw lower bus ridership. But when the bus stops were shaded by trees, the area was twice as cool and prevented steep ridership lost. The findings prompted the Houston transit authority, METRO and other agencies to begin work to redesign their bus stops to provide relief from the heat, Lanza said.",
      "As of June, according to reporting from Houston Public Media, six shelters have been redesigned to allow more airflow, with more stops expected to be replaced over the next six months.",
      "In 2023, Cap Metro, the transit authority in Austin, also used Lanza\u2019s study to develop a plan to mitigate heat impacts by planting more tree across the city and near existing bus stops.",

      "In June, Institute launched a Latino Climate and Health Dashboard, which creates a centralized source that shows the climate disparities Latino neighborhoods across California. Developed with guidance from a statewide advisory committee of climate justice, public health, and data equity experts, the dashboard shows 90% of California's Latino population faces climate inequities, from higher air pollution to more days of extreme heat than white residents.",
      "\u201cThe disparities shown in the dashboard are not random,\u201d said Silver, a senior research analyst at the LLPI and the project\u2019s leader.",
      "Silver said the main purpose of the dashboard is to ensure local leaders, community groups, government agencies and others have access to trustworthy data that reflects the experience communities in California and so many other states are facing.",
      "\u201cThe more climate change intensifies the more difficult it is for people to live, and the more dangerous it is for people to be outside,\u201d Silver said.",
      "The dashboard will help create a shift to more inclusive climate planning by helping organizations understand who is most affected and where the greatest needs are.",

      "ATLANTA -- Florida conservative Joe Gruters, a Donald Trump cheerleader dating back to his days as a reality TV star, is the president's handpicked choice to be the next Republican National Committee chairman.",
      "Having no opposition, Gruters' formal election is scheduled Friday at the Republicans' summer meeting in Atlanta.",
      "For Gruters, the vote will complete a steady climb from county party leader into the top ranks of Trump\u2019s second presidency. For Trump, Gruters\u2019 ratification reflects his penchant for loyal lieutenants and evolution from a new president disinterested in party machinery to an Oval Office veteran intent on gripping all levers of power.",
      "Here is a look at Gruters\u2019 history with Trump and Republicans and what that means as he becomes chairman.",
      "Trump\u2019s decade of domination over Republican politics is replete with rivals and critics who melted into the fold. Vice President JD Vance once compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio labeled Trump a \u201ccon artist\u201d and mocked his manhood.",
      "But Gruters was a true believer years before Trump launched his first campaign in 2015.",
      "\u201cJoe bet on the horse before the track was even built,\u201d said Christian Ziegler, a former Florida Republican chair and friend of Gruters.",
      "In 2012, Gruters led the Sarasota County GOP, and Republicans were nominating Mitt Romney for president at their convention in nearby Tampa, Florida.",
      "Romney, then the kind of moderate Republican that is now almost extinct in public office, had embraced Trump even as the businessman falsely questioned then-President Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace and citizenship. Still, Trump was widely considered a liability for Romney against Obama, and Romney\u2019s team was circumspect about whether Trump would have a convention role. While Trump was eventually confirmed as a speaker, an approaching tropical storm shortened the convention schedule, and his slot was among the casualties.",
      "Enter Gruters.",
      "The eager Sarasotan had already picked Trump as his county party\u2019s \u201cStatesman of the Year,\u201d slotting a dinner gala at Sarasota\u2019s Ritz-Carlton hotel on convention eve with 1,000 guests. It cemented an enduring friendship.",
      "Gruters\u2019 support for Trump\u2019s first presidential bid in 2015 stood out in Florida, given that Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush also were running.",
      "In October, Gruters became co-chairman of Trump\u2019s Florida campaign. His fellow chair was Susie Wiles, who is now Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff. Bush didn\u2019t make it to the Florida primary, and Trump trounced Rubio, ending the senator\u2019s campaign.",
      "Gruters was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016 at the same time Trump won Florida\u2019s electoral votes and the presidency. And Wiles, Gruters\u2019 old Trump campaign partner, was the mastermind behind Florida Gov. DeSantis\u2019 narrow 2018 victory.",
      "So when it mattered, Gruters was well-positioned with a friend in the Oval Office and the governor\u2019s office \u2014 buoyed by Wiles, who had distinguished herself as a Florida kingmaker.",
      "All those powerful allies backed Gruters' successful bid for Florida GOP chairman in 2019.",

Reince Priebus in 2016 was the reluctant Trump backer who became the president\u2019s chief of staff in 2017, only to be fired via social media post. Trump then turned to Ronna Romney McDaniel, Mitt\u2019s niece. He eventually pushed out McDaniel and tapped North Carolina\u2019s Michael Whatley as chairman, with daughter-in-law Lara Trump as family stand-in at party headquarters.",
      "As chairman, Gruters will be a fundraising partner with the White House. The RNC is a key cog in joint party fundraising efforts that the president headlines.",

That doesn\u2019t just mean policy and branding but also the mechanics of elections. Gruters sidestepped Trump\u2019s election denialism, but he\u2019ll now be partly responsible for building teams of lawyers and poll watchers for a president who openly questions the efficacy of U.S. elections.",
      "Beyond the midterms, Gruters will be the chairman who helps set the presidential primary calendar, debate rules and other nuts and bolts of the 2028 campaign. While Trump is term-limited by the Constitution, he's more than made clear that he will not stay in the shadows as voters choose his successor. With Gruters, he has a direct line into that process.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration said Friday it will not defend a decades-old grant program for colleges with large numbers of Hispanic students that is being challenged in court, declaring the government believes the funding is unconstitutional.",
      "In a memo sent to Congress, the Justice Department said it agrees with a lawsuit attempting to strike down grants that are reserved for colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic. Congress created the program in 1998 after finding Latino students were attending college and graduating at far lower rates than white students.",

Those schools miss out on tens of millions of dollars because of discriminatory requirements, the lawsuit said.",
      "On Friday, the Justice Department released a letter in which Solicitor General D. John Sauer notified Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson that the department \u201chas decided not to defend\u201d the program, saying certain aspects of it are unconstitutional. The letter, dated July 25, cited the 2023 Supreme Court decision outlawing affirmative action, which said \u201coutright racial balancing\u201d is \u201cpatently unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Tennessee is backed in the suit by Students for Fair Admissions, a conservative legal group that successfully challenged affirmative action in admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. That suit led to a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that forbids universities from considering students\u2019 race in admissions decisions.",
      "Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said Friday the group would decline to comment.",
      "More than 500 colleges and universities are designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions, making them eligible for the grant program. Congress appropriated about $350 million for the program in 2024. Colleges compete for the grants, which can go toward a range of uses, from building improvements to science programs.",
      "Former President Joe Biden made Hispanic-serving universities a priority, signing an executive action last year that promised a new presidential advisory board and increased funding. President Donald Trump revoked the order his first day in office.",
      "Trump is taking steps to dismantle the Education Department and has called for massive funding cuts, yet his 2026 budget request preserved grants for Hispanic-serving colleges and even asked Congress for a slight increase. Even so, there have been doubts about his administration\u2019s commitment to the funding.",

      "The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities said Trump\u2019s agenda is \u201centirely adverse\u201d to the group\u2019s interests, citing the president\u2019s aim to close the Education Department entirely. The administration is \u201con record denouncing programs like HSIs, that take account of and seek to redress ethnic or racial disparity,\u201d the group wrote.",

      "The North Carolina Supreme Court has issued favorable rulings for bars seeking compensation for COVID-19 restrictions",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- The North Carolina Supreme Court issued favorable rulings Friday for bars and their operators in litigation seeking monetary compensation from the state for COVID-19 restrictions first issued by then-Gov. Roy Cooper that shuttered their doors and, in their view, treated them unfairly compared to the way restaurants were regulated.",
      "The majority decisions by the justices mean a pair of lawsuits \u2014 one filed by several North Carolina bars and their operators and the second by the North Carolina Bar and Tavern Association and other private bars \u2014 remain alive, and future court orders directing the state pay them financial damages are possible.",
      "As a way to ease the spread of coronavirus, Cooper \u2014 a Democrat who left office last December and is now running for U.S. Senate \u2014 issued a series of executive orders that closed bars starting in March 2020. By that summer, bars still had to remain closed, but restaurants and breweries could serve alcohol during certain hours. Later in 2020, bars could serve alcoholic drinks in outdoor seating, with time limits later added, but the plaintiffs said it was unprofitable to operate. All temporary restrictions on bars were lifted in May 2021.",
      "Lawyers defending Cooper have said the orders in the ninth-largest state were based on the most current scientific studies and public health data available at a time when thousands were ill and dying and vaccines weren't widely available.",
      "On Friday, the court's five Republican justices in one lawsuit agreed it could continue to trial, rejecting arguments from state attorneys that the litigation must be halted based on a legal doctrine that exempts state government from most lawsuits. That decision largely upheld a Court of Appeals decision from two years ago that had affirmed a trial judge's order to allow the action filed by Tiffany Howell, seven other individuals and nine businesses to be heard.",
      "\u201cWe acknowledge that the COVID-19 pandemic was a chaotic period of time,\u201d Chief Justice Paul Newby wrote in the prevailing opinion. \u201cIt is important to remember, however, that the Governor was not the only person facing uncertainty. Small business owners across the state dutifully shuttered their doors and scaled back operations without knowing exactly when they could open or operate fully again.\u201d",
      "A broader group of plaintiffs \u2014 the North Carolina Bar and Tavern Association and private bars \u2014 that sued separately but made similar claims received a favorable ruling last year from a Court of Appeals panel that reversed a trial judge's decision to dismiss the lawsuit.",
      "Friday, the same five justices ruled that the Court of Appeals shouldn't have allowed the association to sue based on claims its members' constitutional rights for equal treatment were violated.",
      "But the plaintiffs can return to a trial judge now and present evidence on the claim that their right under the state constitution to earn a living was violated, Associate Justice Phil Berger Jr. wrote in the majority opinion. A trial judge had previously dismissed the case.",

    "story": [
      "Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano has resumed its eruption by shooting an arc of lava high into the air and across a section of its summit crater floor",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii's Kilauea volcano resumed erupting Friday by shooting an arc of lava 100 feet (30 meters) into the air and across a section of its summit crater floor.",
      "It was Kilauea's 31st display of molten rock since December, an appropriately high frequency for one of the world's most active volcanoes.",
      "The north vent at the summit crater began continuously spattering in the morning, and then lava overflowed a few hours later. The vent started shooting lava fountains in the afternoon.",
      "The eruption was contained within the summit crater, and no homes were threatened.",
      "A few lucky residents and visitors will have a front-row view at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. If the past is a guide, hundreds of thousands more will be watching popular livestreams made possible by three camera angles set up by the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Whenever she gets word the lava is back, Park Service volunteer Janice Wei hustles to shoot photos and videos of Halemaumau Crater \u2014 which Native Hawaiian tradition says is the home to the volcano goddess Pele. She said that when the molten rock shoots high like a fountain, it sounds like a roaring jet engine or crashing ocean waves. She can feel its heat from over a mile away.",
      "\u201cEvery eruption feels like I am sitting in the front row at nature\u2019s most extraordinary show,\u201d Wei said in an email.",
      "Kilauea is on Hawaii Island, the largest of the Hawaiian archipelago. It\u2019s about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the state\u2019s largest city, Honolulu, which is on Oahu.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Kilauea\u2019s latest eruption:",
      "A lower magma chamber under Halemaumau Crater is receiving magma directly from the earth\u2019s interior at about 5 cubic yards (3.8 cubic meters) per second, said Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. This blows the chamber up like a balloon and forces magma into an upper chamber. From there it gets pushed above ground through cracks.",
      "Magma has been using the same pathway to rise to the surface since December, making the initial release and subsequent episodes all part of the same eruption, Hon said.",
      "Many have featured lava soaring into the air, in some cases more than 1,000 feet (300 meters). The fountains are generated in part because magma \u2014 which holds gases that are released as it rises \u2014 has been traveling to the surface through narrow, pipelike vents.",
      "The expanding magma supply is capped by heavier magma that had expelled its gas at the end of the prior episode. Eventually enough new magma accumulates to force the degassed magma off, and the magma shoots out like a Champagne bottle that was shaken before the cork was popped.",
      "This is the fourth time in 200 years that Kilauea has shot lava fountains into the air in repeated episodes. There were more episodes the last time Kilauea followed this pattern: The eruption that began in 1983 started with 44 sessions of shooting fountains. Those were spread out over three years, however. And the fountains emerged in a remote area, so few got to watch.",
      "The other two occurred in 1959 and 1969.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know how the current eruption will end or how it may change. In 1983 magma built enough pressure that Kilauea opened a vent at a lower elevation and started continuously leaking lava from there rather than periodically shooting out of a higher elevation. The eruption continued in various forms for three decades and ended in 2018.",

      "Scientists can estimate a few days or even a week ahead of time when lava is likely to emerge with the help of sensors around the volcano that detect earthquakes and minuscule changes in the angle of the ground, which indicate when magma is inflating or deflating.",
      "\u201cOur job is like being a bunch of ants crawling on an elephant trying to figure out how the elephant works,\u201d Hon said.",
      "The lava fountains have been shorter lately. Steve Lundblad, a University of Hawaii at Hilo geology professor, said the vent may have gotten wider, leaving molten rock less pressurized.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still gonna have spectacular eruptions,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re just going to be wider and not as high.\u201d",
      "Some people may see lava flows as destructive. But Huihui Kanahele-Mossman, the executive director of the Edith Kanaka\u02bbole Foundation, said lava is a natural resource that hardens into land and forms the foundation for everything on Hawaii Island.",
      "Kanahele-Mossman\u2019s nonprofit is named after her grandmother \u2014 the esteemed practitioner of Hawaiian language and culture and founder of a noted hula halau, or school. H\u0101lau o Kekuhi is celebrated for its mastery of a style of hula rooted in the stories of Pele and her sister, Hi\u02bbiaka.",
      "Kanahele-Mossman has visited the crater a few times since the eruption began. She initially watches in awe and reverence. But then she observes more details so she can go home and compare it to the lava in the centuries-old tales that her school performs. While at the crater, she also delivers a chant prepared in advance and places offerings. Recently she presented awa, a drink made with kava, and a fern lei.",
      "\u201cYou as the dancer, you are the storyteller and you carry that history that was written in those mele forward,\u201d she said, using the Hawaiian word for song. \u201cTo be able to actually see that eruption that\u2019s described in the mele, that\u2019s always exciting to us and drives us and motivates us to stay in this tradition.\u201d",
      "Park visitation has risen all eight months of the year so far, in part because of the eruption. In April there were 49% more visitors than the same month of 2024.",
      "Park spokesperson Jessica Ferracane noted that the last several episodes have only lasted about 10 to 12 hours. Those wanting to go should sign up for U.S. Geological Survey alert notifications because the eruption could be over before you know it, she said.",
      "She cautioned that visitors should stay on marked trails and overlooks because unstable cliff edges and cracks in the earth may not be immediately apparent, and falling could lead to serious injury or death. Young children should be kept close.",
      "Volcanic gas, glass and ash can also be dangerous. Nighttime visitors should bring a flashlight.",

      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump was quick to declare \u201cTOTAL VICTORY\u201d after a New York appeals court threw out a civil fraud penalty that stood to cost him more than a half-billion dollars.",
      "But Thursday\u2019s ruling overturning the key punishment in New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit isn\u2019t the last word. James, a Democrat, has vowed to appeal to the state\u2019s highest court.",

      "Here\u2019s a look at how the court ruled and what\u2019s next:",
      "A five-judge panel of New York\u2019s mid-level Appellate Division overturned Trump\u2019s whopping monetary penalty while narrowly endorsing a lower court\u2019s finding that he, his company and co-defendants engaged in fraud by padding his wealth on financial statements he used to secure loans and make deals.",
      "\u201cWhile harm certainly occurred, it was not the cataclysmic harm that can justify a nearly half billion-dollar award,\u201d two of the judges wrote.",
      "The penalty \u2014 which started at a base of $355 million and has since soared to more than $515 million with interest \u2014 violated the U.S. Constitution\u2019s ban on excessive fines, the judges ruled. They also dismissed several million dollars more in monetary penalties for Trump\u2019s co-defendants, including sons and Trump Organization executives Eric and Donald Trump Jr.",
      "James, a perennial thorn in Trump\u2019s side, sued him in 2022, alleging he padded his net worth by billions of dollars on financial paperwork and habitually misled banks and others about the value of prized assets like golf courses, hotels, Trump Tower and his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "After a trial, Judge Arthur Engoron ruled last year that James had proven Trump engaged in a yearslong conspiracy with executives at his company to deceive banks and insurers about his wealth and assets.",
      "\u201cThe frauds found here leap off the page and shock the conscience,\u201d Engoron wrote in February 2024.",
      "James said Thursday that she will seek to challenge the Appellate Division\u2019s ruling in the state\u2019s highest court, the Court of Appeals.",
      "Otherwise sharply divided, the Appellate Division judges agreed that Trump\u2019s monetary penalty was excessive. That could make it tough for James' office to convince the Court of Appeals to step in and revive the fine.",
      "But, as is common in a multi-layer appeals court system, the Appellate Division and the Court of Appeals aren't always in sync.",
      "Trump could also choose to appeal the court's decision to further fight the finding that he committed fraud. A message seeking comment was left for his lawyers.",
      "Trump never paid the lower court\u2019s hefty fine, so there won\u2019t be any half-billion dollar checks exchanging hands.",
      "Instead, the president is now eligible to get back the $175 million bond he posted to hold off collection while he pursued his appeal. Such bonds are common in the appellate process, acting as placeholder to guarantee payment.",

      "The Appellate Division nixed Trump\u2019s monetary punishment but upheld other penalties. They include:",

      "\u2014 A three-year ban on Trump and his companies from getting loans from banks registered in New York.",
      "Those measures have been on hold during the appellate process and, the judges said, Trump can seek a court order to extend the pause pending further appeals.",
      "The Appellate Division judges were divided on whether it\u2019s practical or even necessary to hold another trial. The prospect of a retrial, with Trump or at least his lawyers again hunkered down in a Manhattan courtroom, was one of several topics that split the judges across three separate concurring and dissenting opinions totaling 323 pages and more than 100,000 words.",

      "Erin's outer bands brushed North Carolina on Wednesday, but the storm never made landfall and caused no widespread damage to infrastructure despite being twice the size of an average hurricane. After progressing north in the Atlantic, it weakened into a post-tropical cyclone Friday, far from land.",

      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio has announced this week that the U.S. will pause issuing work visas to some foreign truck drivers",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced this week that the U.S. will pause issuing work visas to some foreign truck drivers, warning darkly that they are \u201cendangering American lives and undercutting the livelihoods of American truckers.\u201d",
      "He provided no details Thursday in his two-sentence post on the social platform X, leaving some in the trucking industry wondering if many drivers would be affected.",
      "The short answer: No.",
      "But the announcement appeared to be as much about politics as road safety, coming as a deadly Florida crash involving a foreign truck driver became increasingly politicized, with the offices of two ambitious governors battling publicly over responsibility.",
      "With the Florida crash spilling into national politics, here\u2019s what you should know:",
      "It depends how you define \u201cmany,\u201d and the exact number isn\u2019t clear. But it appears that at most a few thousand of the country\u2019s estimated 3.5 million commercial truck drivers would be affected by the new directive.",
      "The pause is aimed at drivers applying for three types of visas, the State Department said Friday, most notably the H-2B visa for temporary workers.",
      "Only roughly 1,500 visas for truck drivers were issued this fiscal year under the program, and 1,400 last year, according to Jeff Joseph, president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.",
      "The program has helped offset what many observers see as a persistent shortage of commercial drivers.",
      "But H-2B visas are capped for most years at 66,000, with drivers making up only a couple percent of the total.",
      "The other two visa categories listed by the State Department are the E-2, for people who make substantial investments in a U.S. business, and the EB-3, which is for skilled workers such as health care employees, IT professionals and skilled tradespeople like electricians.",
      "The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, a trade association representing small-business truck drivers, applauded the administration for \u201cseeing through the myth of a truck driver shortage and continuing efforts to restore commonsense safety standards on our nation\u2019s highways.\u201d",
      "The association dismisses talk of scarcity, saying there are often independent truckers available but companies prefer drivers who cost less.",
      "Jerry Maldonado of the Laredo Motor Carriers Association, a group of 200 trucking companies operating on both sides of the southern border, was relieved when the State Department released more details about Rubio\u2019s announcement.",
      "Mexican and Canadian drivers operate in the U.S. with B-1 visas, he said, which allow non-U.S. citizens to enter the country briefly. Some worried those visas could also be paused.",
      "\u201cThe announcement did scare some people, but I\u2019m glad for the clarification,\u201d Maldonado said.",

    "summary": "Jerry Adler's acting credits include \"The Sopranos\" and \"The Good Wife.\" He also had 53 Broadway productions to his name, all behind the scenes.",
    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\"I'm immortal,\" he said.",

      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",

      "\"Trekkies are some of the most devoted fans I think in fandom history,\" Gooding said. \"To be embraced with open arms, reprising an iconic character, they've been so generous and so kind to me and so receptive of my take of her.\"",
      "The series, the 11th in the Star Trek franchise, takes place a decade before the original show. Gooding plays a young Uhura, a Starfleet cadet specializing in linguistics. Though she comes from a family of Trekkies herself, she admitted she was not very familiar with the franchise before landing the role.",
      "\"When they found out that I'd booked the role, I think everyone was ten times more excited than I was,\" Gooding said.",
      "She describes her mom as the biggest Trek fan she knows and said she leaned in her mother's early guidance, from perfecting the Vulcan salute to embracing the show's spirit.",
      "\"'Trek' is all about curiosity and hope and community,\" Gooding said.",
      "Gooding explained that she intentionally avoided learning too much about Uhura's future storylines, since the prequel format means her character doesn't know what's ahead.",
      "\"She doesn't know her future, so it's probably best to not be too, too informed,\" Gooding said. \"So I'm not playing as if I know what's going to happen to me, because no one knows what tomorrow brings.\"",
      "This week's episode marks a turning point for Uhura, as she faces scrutiny as she navigates her dual identity as both a young woman in her early twenties and a Starfleet officer entrusted with a lot of responsibility.",
      "\"When that responsibility is interrogated, when her contributions to Starfleet are interrogated in a way that she's not expecting, she has to confront her contributions to the institution that is Starfleet in a way that I don't think Star Trek has given audiences a lens into before,\" Gooding said.",
      "The season also introduces lighter moments, including a budding romance.",
      "\"I just was really excited for her to have some levity and some joy and some flirtation,\" Gooding said. \"A little quasi workplace romance can't hurt anybody in the fictional world. It's just fun to play a recognizable, playful version of this character.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Aug 2025 22:23:53 -0400",
    "summary": "Mississippi's infant mortality rate nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health.",
    "story": [
      "Mississippi health officials have declared a public health emergency after releasing data showing the state's infant mortality rate\u00a0has risen to its highest level in more than a decade.",
      "In Mississippi, 9.7 infants died for every 1,000 live births in 2024, nearly double the most recent national average of 5.6 deaths per 1,000, according to the state Department of Health. Since 2014, more than 3,500 Mississippi infants have died before their first birthday.",
      "The decision to declare a public health emergency places Mississippi's struggle within\u00a0a wider national story. Here's what to know.",
      "Infant mortality rate a nationwide concern",
      "Even in cities with strong healthcare systems, such as Boston, Black infants continue to die at far higher rates than their White peers.",
      "In Boston, the city's most recent report showed Black infants dying at more than twice the rate of the overall population and triple the rate of White infants, despite the city's overall infant mortality rate falling below the national average. Public health experts say both examples underscore the limits of focusing only on individual behavior or clinical care when structural inequities are key drivers of infant deaths.",
      "\"Every single infant loss represents a family devastated, a community impacted, and a future cut short,\" said State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney, who announced the Mississippi declaration. \"We cannot and will not accept these numbers as our reality.\"",
      "What is causing higher infant mortality rate?",
      "The leading causes of infant death in Mississippi include congenital malformations, premature birth, low birthweight, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.",
      "Disparities remain stark \u2014 Black infants in Mississippi are more than twice as likely as White infants to die before their first birthday, and recent state data show those racial gaps have widened.",
      "Despite growing concerns, declaring a public health emergency for infant mortality is unusual.",
      "\"This is a novel and necessary step,\" said Dr. Michael Warren, Chief Medical and Health Officer at March of Dimes. \"It elevates infant mortality to the level of urgent crisis response, which it truly is.\"",
      "Why a public health emergency was declared",
      "State officials said the declaration allows them to move more quickly to address gaps in care.",
      "Their plan includes expanding prenatal services in counties without obstetric providers, creating an obstetric system of care to regionalize services and improve emergency transfers, and strengthening home visiting and community health worker programs.",
      "\"Improving maternal health is the best way to reduce infant mortality,\" Dr. Edney said.",
      "Dr. Morgan McDonald, National Director for Population Health at New York-based nonprofit Milbank Memorial Fund, said the declaration \"should draw our attention to a problem that is tragic and preventable.\"",
      "She added: \"We applaud Dr. Edney and his public health team for raising the alarm in a way that honors the families who have suffered this tragedy and also focuses attention on concrete solutions.\"",
      "Experts caution, however, that individual and clinical interventions alone cannot solve the problem.",
      "\"Healthy babies come from healthy moms,\" said Dr. Rebekah Gee, former Louisiana health secretary and now CEO of Nest Health, a New Orleans-based company which provides in-home whole-family care, with a focus on those covered by Medicaid. \"If women can't get continuous healthcare before, during, and after pregnancy, it is no surprise their babies are dying at higher rates.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, a neonatologist and professor at Emory University, added that treating infant deaths as a series of isolated medical cases misses the broader reality. \"So much of what we see in neonatal intensive care units reflects challenges that moms face long before delivery \u2014 poverty, access to healthcare, housing, even transportation,\" Patrick said.",
      "Health care programs and infant health",
      "Federal funding cuts are also complicating the state's response to the crisis.",
      "The Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention program that collects state-specific data on maternal and infant health, has been targeted for elimination. CDC staffers who carried out the survey established nearly 40 years ago to improve maternal and infant health outcomes were fired in June.",
      "Mississippi relied PRAMS to track maternal behaviors before, during, and after pregnancy, and to monitor infant outcomes. Many of CDC's Safe Motherhood initiatives are also in jeopardy of losing funding, which would affect maternal mortality surveillance, infant sleep safety programs, and hospital-based collaboratives designed to standardize care.",
      "\"Without robust data, we are flying blind,\" Patrick said.",
      "Analysts also warn that such cuts could limit the state's ability to detect trends such as unsafe sleep practices or gaps in postpartum care.",
      "\"It's willful ignorance to cut vital maternal and child health programs when we have public health crises of both maternal mortality and infant mortality in this country,\" said a former CDC Division of Reproductive Health staffer who lost their job in a recent reduction in force. \"For many people, it's downright dangerous to be pregnant in the U.S. in the 21st century. And that is shameful.\"",
      "Polling suggests most Americans support maintaining these programs. According to the Emory-Rollins National Child Policy Poll, 65% of Americans say PRAMS is important for improving outcomes for mothers and infants, while fewer than one in ten believe it is not needed.",
      "Similarly, only 16% supported ending federal funding for the long-running \"Safe to Sleep\" campaign, which educated parents about reducing risks of sleep-related infant deaths.",
      "How changes to Medicaid will impact Mississippi",
      "Medicaid\u00a0plays an outsized role in Mississippi, financing almost 6 in 10 of births in the state, compared to about 4 in 10 nationally, according a\u00a0KFF Health News analysis of government data.",
      "In 2023, the state extended postpartum\u00a0Medicaid coverage\u00a0from two months to a full year. But Mississippi has\u00a0not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving many low-income women uninsured before or between pregnancies.",
      "Meanwhile, Congressional proposals could reshape Medicaid coverage, including the reconciliation bill already passed by Congress which would require many enrollees in the government health care program to prove they are either working, volunteering or in school to receive coverage.",
      "Dr. McDonald noted that since Mississippi is not a Medicaid expansion state, it would be subject to most of the work requirement and frequent redetermination provisions of President Trump's so-called \"Big Beautiful Bill.\"",
      "KFF analysts estimate that bill's funding caps and work requirements could raise Mississippi's uninsured rate by 1 to 2%, potentially leaving 20,000 to 40,000 more residents without coverage.",
      "Public health experts say such policies could destabilize rural hospitals that rely heavily on Medicaid reimbursement, in turn limiting access to prenatal and delivery services in regions already described as \"OB deserts.\"",
      "Other states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act have seen measurable improvements in infant health.",
      "Arkansas, for example, reported a 29% reduction in Black infant mortality in the five years following expansion. In Louisiana, which expanded Medicaid in 2016, researchers documented increases in early prenatal care and decreases in premature births. Colorado also saw declines in infant mortality, particularly in rural areas, as more women gained access to continuous coverage before, during, and after pregnancy.",
      "Nationally, one analysis found a 50% greater reduction in infant mortality in expansion states compared to those that did not expand Medicaid, with the steepest gains among Black infants. Today, 40 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid, while Mississippi remains one of 10 holdouts.",
      "The U.S. has long treated infant mortality as a measure of societal health. More than a century ago, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois argued that high rates of infant deaths among Black families reflected inequities in living conditions rather than innate differences.",
      "Mississippi's emergency declaration and Boston's persistent disparities suggest those inequities remain deeply entrenched. State officials said the declaration is intended to galvanize coordinated action across hospitals, state agencies, and community groups.",
      "\"It will take all of us working together to give every child the chance to live, thrive, and celebrate their first birthday,\" Dr. Edney said.",

    "published": "Sun, 24 Aug 2025 23:30:21 -0400",
    "summary": "Baristas at the coffee chain worry the company won't fulfill its promise to improve working conditions.",
    "story": [
      "Liberte Locke, a 32-year-old \"barista\" at a Starbucks (SBUX) in New York City, is fed up.",
      "\"Starbucks' attitude is that there's always someone else who can do the job,\" she said in running through her complaints about life at the java giant.",
      "If that isn't necessarily the consensus among Starbucks workers, interviews with nine current and former baristas at the company make clear it's not an isolated opinion, either. Even those who say they like their job paint a picture of a business that underpays front-line workers, enforces work rules arbitrarily, and too often fails to strike a balance between corporate goals and employee needs.",
      "Of course, such complaints are nothing new in retail, where low pay and erratic schedules are the norm. But by its own account, Starbucks is no ordinary company and is ostensibly a far cry from the fast-food outlets now facing a nationwide uprising by employees tired of working for peanuts.",
      "That's evident in the company's recruitment pitch. Starbucks invites job-seekers to \"become a part of something bigger and inspire positive change in the world,\" describing it as a chance to discover a \"deep sense of purpose.\"",
      "Damage control",
      "That image suffered a serious blow last month after The New York Times vividly chronicled a Starbucks worker struggling with the company's scheduling practices. The story, which centered on a 22-year-old barista and single mother, amounted to a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Perhaps not coincidentally, within days of the story's publication top executives were promising reform.",
      "In a memo to employees earlier this month, for instance, Chief Operating Officer Troy Alstead vowed to \"transform the U.S. partner experience,\" referring to Starbucks' more than 130,000 baristas.  Inviting worker feedback, he said Starbucks will examine its approach to employee pay, revisit its dress code, make it easier for people to ask for time off, and consider other changes aimed at helping baristas balance work and their personal lives.",
      "Among other changes, the company said it would end the practice of \"clopening,\" when an employee responsible for closing a store late at night is also assigned to open it early in the morning.",
      "\"We recognize that we can do more for our partners who wear the apron every day,\" he wrote.",
      "Although Starbucks workers welcome this pledge to respect the apron, they fear the company is more intent on dousing the PR flames than on genuinely improving employees' experience. After the retailer last month sent an email to workers outlining possible solutions to the kind of scheduling problems and related issues detailed by the Times, a group of baristas gave the proposal a C- and posted online a marked-up version of the memo listing their own demands (see image above).",
      "\"We hope you're ready for a commitment to give us schedules that don't mess with taking care of kids, going to school or holding onto that second job we need because Sbux wages don't make ends meet,\" wrote the baristas, who are working with a union-backed labor group, the Center for Popular Democracy.",
      "Retail jungle",
      "Despite the recent media focus on Starbucks, the company's labor practices are generally no worse than those of many large retailers. In some ways they're better, with the company offering health care to part-time, as well as full-time, workers; unusually generous 401(k) matching contributions; annual stock grants to employees; and tuition reimbursement.",
      "Starbucks highlights such benefits as an example of its commitment to employees. \"Sharing success with one another has been core to the company's heritage for more than 40 years,\" Alstead said in the September memo.",
      "Meanwhile, some baristas say they enjoy their work and feel valued by Starbucks. \"It's a decent place to work, and my manager and co-workers are great,\" said one employee who asked not to be identified.",
      "But other current and former workers claim Starbucks has changed in recent years, saying that  corporate leaders' intense focus on slashing costs has short-circuited its professed commitment to workers. Mostly, they say Starbucks doesn't listen to employees and even punishes those who identify problems.",
      "\"The biggest problem is that baristas don't have a voice,\" said Sarah  Madden, a former Starbucks barista who left the company this spring  after two years with the coffee vendor. \"They can't speak to issues that  they know exist. Workers know how to fix them, but when [they] speak up  there are serious repercussions -- your hours get cut, you're  transferred to another store or isolated from other people.\"",
      "Employees interviewed for this article said one result of Starbucks' cost-containment push is that stores are frequently understaffed, hurting customer service and forcing managers to scramble to find staff. That problem is common across the big-box stores that dominate the retail sector, experts said.",
      "\"On the one hand, retailers overhire, but they're also understaffed, so  everybody's running around and then there aren't enough people on the  floor,\" said Susan Lambert, a professor at the University of Chicago and  an expert in work-life issues. \"Companies are effectively loading all  the risk onto workers so that they're not the ones incurring the risks  inherent in business.\"",
      "Starbucks denies that its stores are short-staffed. \"We're proud of the level of service we provide in our stores,\" said Zack Hutson, a spokesman for the company. \"We know that the connection our partners have with customers is the foundation of the Starbucks experience. It wouldn't be in our best interest. We want our customers to have the appropriate service level when they come to our stores.\"",
      "To be sure, Starbucks is hardly the only U.S. corporate giant to keep a gimlet eye on its bottom line -- among Fortune 500 companies that approach to management is the rule, not the exception, and CEOs across the land defend it as an inviolable fiduciary duty to shareholders.",
      "But baristas say Starbucks' focus on profits and cost-cutting has increasingly led its leadership to tune workers out. Locke, who has worked for the company since 2006 and who earns roughly $16,000 a year, said she yearned for the Starbucks of old.",
      "\"When I started they had a training program and taught you how to be a coffee expert. There was more of a culture of supporting each other as co-workers. Store managers were sympathetic. I really enjoyed it.\"",
      "Asked why she stays at Starbucks, Locke said her employment options are limited because she lacks a college education and because her only professional experience is in retail.",
      "Living wage?",
      "According to workers, the best thing Starbucks can do for its apron-wearers is to raise their pay and offer full-time hours instead of the 20 to 30 hours that most employees work.",
      "Samantha Cole, a barista in Omaha, Neb., said she struggles to get by on her supervisor's salary of $11.25 an hour. Such pay may be better than what she would earn working for other retailers, but the 30-year-old mother of two say it's still not a living wage.",
      "\"I'm definitely not making enough money,\" said Cole, who has been with the company for six years. \"A lot of us are right there with what fast-food workers are making.\"",
      "Such frustrations are also evident in comments on the Facebook page Starbucks uses to communicate with employees and where it is asking baristas for input regarding the company's labor practices. Wrote one employee: \"I've worked for the company for 7 years in January, and I don't make enough to support myself on one job so I work 2 jobs, 6 days a week.... I've seen a lot of amazing partners leave because they don't make enough.\"",
      "Starbucks declined to disclose compensation data, citing competitive reasons and saying that pay varies widely according to workers' experience and where in the U.S. stores are located. It didn't respond to emails requesting clarification regarding other aspects of its labor policies.",
      "It's worth noting that low pay isn't unique to Starbucks -- in retail it is the norm. As of 2012 (the latest year for which data is available), the median hourly income for retail salespeople is $10.29 per hour, or $21,410 a year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Hourly pay for full-time retail workers range from a high of $14.42 to $9.61 for lower-paid people, according to Demos, a liberal-leaning think tank in New York. Part-timers typically make much less, with the average cashier earning $18,500 a year.",
      "\"Until [Starbucks] gives a living wage to every employee, they can't claim to be a good employer,\" Locke said, who added that it has been roughly two years since her last pay raise.",
      "\"Race to the bottom\"",
      "Another priority for baristas: stable, regular schedules. Like most large retailers, Starbucks uses scheduling software to try to match the number of workers it has in a store at any given time to the amount of business it gets. Workers also may be scheduled according to the sales they generate or their facility in promoting certain products. The technology also can enable other savings, such as limiting overtime.",
      "For employees, however, that approach -- known as \"just-in-time\" or \"on-call\" scheduling -- often results in lower income and chaotic hours.",
      "Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at City University of New York's Murphy Institute, characterizes the widespread adoption of scheduling and so-called workforce optimization technologies as a \"new race to the bottom.\"",
      "\"Companies that have already reduced operating costs by making deals with irresponsible subcontractors and using the cheapest available materials are now cutting corners in the form of the 'just-in- time scheduling' of their workforce,\" she and her co-authors wrote in a recent report. \"These 'lean' manufacturing practices take advantage of sophisticated software and an increasingly desperate workforce to cut labor costs to the bone.\"",
      "By the same token, tighter control of worker schedules helps Starbucks contain payroll costs. But it also means employees who had expected to work a certain number of hours every week can see their schedules dramatically cut back and fluctuate wildly. The result? Smaller paychecks and a disturbance to family life.",
      "\"It makes it very hard for parents to participate in an intimate family routine and structure it in such a way that experts agree is good for children,\" Lambert said.",
      "Irregular schedules also make it hard for workers who do need extra income to work a second job, schedule appointments and plan other aspects of their lives.",
      "Baristas said Starbucks posts their schedule only days in advance and that they are often subject to change. Following the Times story, Starbucks said it would post schedules at least one week in advance. That's not enough time, several workers said, asking the company to provide at least two or three weeks notice, as retailers ranging from Walmart (WMT) and H&M to Victoria's Secret (LB) do.",
      "Meanwhile, despite Starbucks' promise to end clopening, the practice continues, some workers said, although the company insists that this is only in cases when people request such shifts.",
      "\"Partners should never be required to work opening and closing shifts. That policy is clear,\" Starbucks' Hutson said, adding that the company is studying ways to give workers more input in their schedules. \"If there are cases where that's not happening, we want to know about that.\"",
      "Given the scrutiny on Starbucks, the company can count on baristas to do just that.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cracker-barrel-cbrl-stock-down-200-million-loss-new-logo-change/",
    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 22:42:50 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel stock plunged as much as 15% after the restaurant chain released a new logo that removes its long-time image of a man leaning against a barrel.",
    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million for year, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares have risen 7% this year to $55.42 as Friday morning, but the stock has fallen sharply since 2018, when it topped $180.",

      "President Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",

      "On Friday, the president took it a step further: \"I'll fire her if she doesn't resign,\" he said.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has been under pressure from President Trump to lower the central bank's benchmark interest rate.",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday highlighted twin economic risks of a slowing labor market and rising inflation, but opened the door to rate cuts in a widely anticipated speech at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming economic forum.",
      "\"Risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment are to the downside \u2014 a challenging situation,\" Powell said in his speech.",
      "The Fed will \"proceed carefully\" but the shifting balance of risks \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" Powell said.",
      "Powell's remarks signal the Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates at its Sept. 17 meeting, which would mark the first reduction since December 2024, several economists said in research notes following the speech. Wall Street cheered Powell's remarks, with the S&P 500 jumping 1.3% in late morning trading.",
      "\"That's about as clear cut as Powell can get that he has shifted his view since July and is leaning toward a cut in September,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"He justifies this change in view by acknowledging the downside risks to employment after the shocking July jobs report.\"",
      "While Powell highlighted the slowdown in the labor market, he also maintained that inflation risks from Mr. Trump's tariffs remain. The Fed has been closely watching the nation's inflation rate, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% annual target and which has inched higher in recent months.",
      "Under the Fed's mandate, the central bank is tasked with keeping both inflation and unemployment low.",
      "Powell said the tariffs could result in a \"one-time shift in the price level,\" resulting in a short-term boost to inflation.",
      "\"Of course, 'one-time' does not mean 'all at once',\" he added. \"It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\"",
      "Powell's comments come as he faces a range of pressures, including President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation and conflicting economic signals that could make it tougher for the Fed to fulfill its dual mandate of promoting full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "When monetary policy makers opted to hold rates steady last month, Powell at that time highlighted the growing economic uncertainty stemming from Mr. Trump's tariffs, while adding that he believed the economy remained on solid ground.",
      "Yet subsequent economic data has pointed to a slowdown. Job growth \u2014 a key measure of the economy's strength \u2014 significantly undershot economists' forecasts, while a large downward revision in May and June payroll gains suggested the labor market was shakier than previously thought.",
      "Prior to Powell's speech, the probability of a rate cut at the Fed's September meeting stood at about 72%, according to CME FedWatch, which bases its calculations on 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices.",

      "While Powell will likely touch on economic trends on Friday, he's expected to keep the question of a Fed rate cut close to his chest.",
      "So far this year, the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) which Powell serves as the chairman of, has held off on a rate cut, maintaining a cautious approach as it continues to assess the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. That's despite pressure from President Trump, who has repeatedly urged the central bank leader to lower rates.",

    "summary": "Jerome Powell will address the state of the U.S. economy \u2014 and perhaps offer hints about interest rates \u2014 in a closely watched speech on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell takes the stage Friday at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic forum, he will face pressures ranging from President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation to a recent mix of worrying economic data.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, could be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "\"The last time we heard from the chair at the July FOMC meeting, Powell struck a notably hawkish tone, arguing that the labor market was 'solid' and that inflation was still too high, even excluding tariff effects,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note this week. \"We expect a somewhat different tone from Powell this week, particularly with respect to the labor market.\"",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation. The following month, the Fed announced a jumbo cut\u00a0of 0.50 percentage points in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "Dueling mandates",
      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "\"Data alone suggests a rising risk of a stagflationary scenario, which is, you know, a Fed nightmare,\" Denyer said. \"That puts them in a bind between their two mandates being in conflict.\"",
      "Minutes for the Fed's July 30 rate decision meeting, when the FOMC again chose to hold rates steady, show that some members \"remained worried that supply-chain disruptions could cause inflation to remain stubbornly elevated,\" signaling that price increases remain top of mind, noted Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet in a report on Wednesday.",
      "\"The labor market will be the swing factor on whether the Fed cuts interest rates in September or not,\" he added.",

    "summary": "Energy suppliers are having trouble keeping up with the rapid increase in demand, and consumers in some states are seeing higher monthly bills.",
    "story": [
      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "Gramlich indicated he expects energy prices to remain high for the foreseeable future, predicting that \"two years from now, we're going to see a lot more policy discussion about it.\"",

    "story": [
      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",
      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Trade Commission on Wednesday sued the operators of the popular gym franchise L.A. Fitness and other gyms for allegedly subjecting members to what it called \"exceedingly difficult\" cancellation policies.",
      "Filed in California federal court, the lawsuit accused Fitness International and Fitness & Sports Clubs of intentionally using complicated cancellation procedures to prevent their customers from ending their gym memberships and other recurring charges. The California-based companies \"have illegally charged hundreds of millions of dollars in unwanted recurring fees\" as a result, the FTC said in its complaint.",
      "Fitness International and Fitness & Sports Clubs run gym chains including L.A. Fitness, Esporta Fitness, City Sports Club and City Studio, according to the FTC, which said they collectively operate more than 600 gym locations and have upwards of 3.7 million members nationwide.",
      "\"The FTC's complaint describes a scenario that too many Americans have experienced \u2013 a gym membership that seems impossible to cancel,\" said Christopher Mufarrige, the director of the Consumer Protection Bureau, in a\u00a0statement\u00a0released by the trade commission. \"Tens of thousands of LA Fitness customers reported difficulties \u2013 cancellation was often restricted to specific times or required speaking to specific managers who were often not present or available.\"",
      "Both companies offer gym memberships for fees as low as $30 per month and as high as $299 per month, and require customers to pay for the first and last month of their memberships upfront before incurring monthly dues and annual fees, the FTC said. In its complaint, the commission detailed \"restrictive\" and confusing cancellation requirements, with an in-person process that's difficult to access being one method, and a mail-in process being another.",
      "\"Each of these cancellation methods is opaque, complicated, and demanding\u2014far from simple,\" the complaint said. \"In particular, Defendants have not adequately disclosed how to cancel when consumers are signing up for their memberships and have presented different, often contradictory, cancellation requirements during sign up, in membership agreements, and on the Defendants' websites.\"",
      "Fitness International addressed the lawsuit in a statement, saying \"the allegations are without merit\" and its leadership was \"disappointed that the FTC has chosen to pursue this complaint.\"",
      "\"It is important to note that most of our memberships, and all of our personal training memberships, are purchased in person at our club locations,\" said Jill Hill, the president of club operations at Fitness International, in the statement. Hill said the company also complied with the FTC's now-void \"click-to-cancel\" rule\u00a0that aimed to make it easier for consumers to cancel recurring subscriptions and memberships.",
      "Although the rule did not take effect, Hill said Fitness International has maintained an online program for members to cancel their subscriptions, in addition to the in-person and mail-in options.",
      "\"Our company works diligently to comply with all health club state laws regarding membership cancellations and to offer at a minimum every cancellation method specifically required by each state,\" Hill said. \"Over the years, the company has taken many steps to improve its enrollment and cancellation processes.\"",

    "story": [
      "Walmart Inc.\u00a0reported increases in second-quarter profits and sales Thursday as it pulls in shoppers seeking low prices\u00a0for groceries\u00a0and other essentials to offset worries that\u00a0new U.S. tariffs\u00a0may make a variety of goods more expensive.",
      "The nation's largest retailer also increased its annual profit and sales outlook. Quarterly results from Walmart and other major U.S. retailers this week offer clues on how\u00a0consumers are reacting\u00a0to the possibility of tariff-related price increases.",
      "The company, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, said it earned $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the three-month period that ended ended July 31. That compares with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago.",
      "Sales rose nearly 5% to $177.4 billion.",
      "A growing list of companies, including\u00a0Procter & Gamble, E.lf. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren, told investors in recent weeks that they planned to or already had raised prices because of\u00a0tariffs, though modestly.",
      "None of that has derailed consumer spending. Shoppers spent at a\u00a0healthy pace in July,\u00a0particularly at the nation's auto dealerships, as signs emerged that President Donald Trump's trade policies were taking a\u00a0toll on jobs.",
      "Some of that spending may have been shoppers buying furniture and other imported items to get ahead of expected price increases, analysts said.",
      "On Tuesday,\u00a0Home Depot, the nation's largest home improvement retailer, reported improved sales during its latest quarter as consumers remained focused on smaller projects. Like Walmart, Home Depot's performance missed Wall Street's expectations.",
      "The Atlanta-based company also said shoppers should expect modest price increases in some categories as a result of additional costs from tariffs, which are taxes on imports.",
      "Target, which has been struggling to reverse a persistent sales malaise, reported another quarterly decline in comparable sales and said Wednesday that it would only raise prices as a last resort. The Minneapolis-based company said Wednesday that CEO Brian Cornell, who helped reenergize the chain but has\u00a0struggled\u00a0to turn around weak sales in a more competitive retail landscape since the COVID-19 pandemic, plans to step down Feb. 1. Target's Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year company veteran, will succeed Cornell. Cornell will transition to be executive chair of the board.",
      "The discounter's Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said shoppers are looking for value and so the company would focus more on its store label brands, which tend to be less expensive than national labels.",
      "But it's Walmart that serves as a barometer of spending given its outsized power in American retailing. The company maintains that 90% of U.S. households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.",
      "Walmart said\u00a0in May\u00a0that prices had started to increase in late April and got higher in May. But it said Thursday that it had introduced 7,400 price rollbacks, or temporary discounts, across the aisles in the latest quarter.",
      "Walmart's U.S. comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels \u2014 rose 4.6% in the quarter, slightly higher than the 4.5% gain in the fiscal first quarter. Groceries and health and wellness items fueled the growth, the company said., the company said.",
      "Global e-commerce sales rose 25%, above the 22% growth in the fiscal first quarter.",
      "Despite Walmart's solid quarter, its stock price was down more than 2% early Thursday as its earnings per share came in below what analysts had expected. Analysts were expecting 73 cents per share on sales of $175.93 billion for the quarter, according to FactSet.",
      "Per share results, excluding effects of charges related to certain legal matters and from business restructuring, was 68 cents, Walmart said.",
      "The company said Thursday it expects earnings per share to be in the range of 58 cents to 60 cents for the current quarter. Analysts expect 57 cents per share, according to FactSet.",
      "For the year, Walmart raised its per-share estimates to a range of $2.52 to $2.62, up from a previous estimate of a $2.50 to $2.60 range. It said 2025 sales are anticipated to increase 3.75% to 4.75%, more than it projected in May."

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-trump-inflation-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 08:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "For months, economists warned that the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs would sharply boost consumer prices. Here's why it hasn't happened.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a barrage of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year on dozens of U.S. trade partners, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have defied many economists' expectations and remained relatively stable.",
      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often try to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "Some new data centers require energy between 100 and 1000 megawatts, roughly equivalent to powering 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to an April GAO report. For now, however, there are\u00a0no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",

      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",
      "By comparison, the average ChatGPT query uses 0.34 Wh and about one fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has written.",
      "Google also outlined the progress it has made in reducing the environmental impact of its Gemini platform. Over a recent 12-month period, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the median Gemini text prompt decreased by factors of 33x and 44x, respectively, it said.",

      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have issued a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores. We are working with the supplier to investigate,\" Walmart said in an email to CBS News.",
      "The company added that consumers who bought the shrimp shouldn't eat it and should throw it out. Customers can contact the store where they purchased the product for a full refund, it added.",
      "The shrimp could be contaminated with a radioactive isotope called Cesium-137, although the FDA said that no products as of yet have tested positive for it. The agency said it issued the warning about Walmart's Great Value shrimp after it had detected Cesium-137 in a single shipment of frozen shrimp from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati.",
      "That shipment \"did not enter U.S. commerce,\" the FDA said.",
      "Here's what to know about the warning.",
      "Which shrimp products are part of the FDA warning?",
      "The FDA said that consumers \"should not eat or serve certain lots of Great Value raw frozen shrimp from Walmart.\"",
      "The lots are:",
      "Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005540-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027\u00a0Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005538-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027\u00a0Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005539-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027.",

      "Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005539-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027.",
      "What should you do if you bought the shrimp?",
      "Consumers who bought the shrimp cited in the FDA's notice should throw it away, the agency said.",
      "\"Distributors and retailers should dispose of this product and should not sell or serve this product,\" the FDA added.",
      "What is Cesium-137?",
      "Cesium-137, or Cs-137, is the radioactive form of the element cesium, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Produced by nuclear fission, it's used in medical devices and is also a byproduct of nuclear fission in nuclear reactors and weapons testing, the EPA notes.",
      "How dangerous is the potential Cesium-137 contamination?",
      "The Cesium-137 detected in the imported shrimp was about 68 Bq/kg, which the FDA said sits below its threshold of 1200 Bq/kg for \"levels of concern\" for imported foods.",
      "\"At this level, the product would not pose an acute hazard to consumers,\" the FDA said in its warning notice.",
      "However, the FDA noted that repeated low-dose exposure to Cesium-137 carries an \"elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body.\"",
      "It added, \"Avoiding products like the shipment FDA tested with similar levels of Cs-137 is a measure intended to reduce exposure to low-level radiation that could have health impacts with continued exposure over a long period of time.\"",

Guard to crack down on\u00a0what he has called\u00a0an \"epidemic of crime.\" Federal agents have also patrolled the city, and the president has asserted control over the local Metropolitan Police Department.",

      "The mission is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"beautification duty and support.\" The defense secretary has author \u2013 authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but, to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of D.C.",
      "Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, there's \u2013 there's plenty of reasons.",
      "You know, one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're \u2013 when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their National Guards to Washington, D.C.",
      "So who's going to \u2013 who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment. And for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big-government approach in the way they're conducting public safety.",
      "The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful.",
      "And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the president's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans, is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this.",
      "And I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received.",
      "When \u2013 when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need \u2013 where you need a surge of supports for \u2013 for traumas and disasters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this. And this is a direct deflection that the president is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the president watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing, because he's tweeting about you \u2013 or TRUTHing, I guess.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says: \"The Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him.\" And he's talking about \"crime-ridden Baltimore.\" It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime.",
      "He says it's a bad one. He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby D.C. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it.",
      "Is the reality here is you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day. And I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation.",
      "So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local \u2013 with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history, over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That \u2013 well, no, that came from both federal and state money. And, also, Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges.",
      "And the results have been \u2013 have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past 2.5 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20 percent since I have been the governor. And the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet.",
      "And so the reason that I have asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, this \u2013 these tropes, in these 1980s scare tac \u2013 scare tactics.",
      "And, you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called We Our Us, who is a violence intervention group. And they say, we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel, because, while the president is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime,.",
      "But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The president's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore has the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis, fourth highest murder rate.",
      "To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis. But\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Correct.",
      "And we know we have work to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We know \u2013 like, if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your \u2013 the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help. He doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though. He says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF.",
      "Do you need more federal help in policing, if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the president to stop cutting funding, because, if you look at the president's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore, that it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons.",
      "Those are actually real, tangible things\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that the president of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is \u2013 President Trump says so as well \u2013 possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's spending a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I have been on his mind a lot.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020, when the, you know, idea was defund the police.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.",
      "And, yes, the president spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And, yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected.",
      "And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father?",
      "And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods, who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work.",
      "And we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not presidential timber at all.",
      "I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I have been very clear. I'm not running for president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it's interesting that \u2013 but it's interesting. The president seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people.",
      "And that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland.",
      "Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You brought up immigration.",
      "One of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S.",
      "This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and the \u2013 what we know is that, you know, and all we're asking for is that the Constitution be followed on this.",
      "The Constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues. And when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the president manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the president is using to just \u2013 working to exploit the brokenness.",
      "And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety, that\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words, rather than\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process.",
      "I just simply want a court and a judge to decide, what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security, who is \u2013 who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor, and executioner inside this case.",
      "I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting, or gerrymandering, as some people know it.",
      "You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one \u2013 one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, I mean, when I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, because. And I think \u2013 and I think we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and I think \u2013 and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is, this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the president of the United States, very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes, we're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different.",
      "But Democrats redistrict. You know this.,",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where \u2013 where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps.",
      "And we also need to make sure that if the president of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters' voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent \u2013 they have a Republican representative, that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think, if you look at maps across the country, less than 10 percent of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature, less than 10 percent.",
      "And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: So that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so, yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "Good morning, Senator.",
      "I know we have got a bit of a delay here, so I will launch right in.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-New Hampshire): Good morning, or afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, exactly.",
      "You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed. The Pentagon did not explain why.",
      "In addition, the Navy reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed.",
      "Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings.",
      "And they come on the heels of firings earlier this year of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of naval operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things \u2013 one of the strengths of America's military are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks who have the training, the expertise to be able to do the jobs.",
      "And what we don't want is political people in those jobs who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So, it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze. And we're going to try to get that back up if we can. The senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan.",
      "We lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator.",
      "Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday this internationally recognized body backed by the U.N., the IPC \u2013 it tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a manmade famine under way in Gaza. This is a very rare designation. Only four other times has one been designated.",
      "The country you are in, Jordan, called it a shameful failure of humanity, that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three-month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen.",
      "One of the \u2013 we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is a \u2013 funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration.",
      "They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in, in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable.",
      "Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he is doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli prime minister's office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it \u2013 quote \u2013 \"a modern blood libel spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\"",
      "That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate, rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor. And the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it.",
      "But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that. They are getting ready to do another \u2013 or they have already started planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people.",
      "So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand your criticism right now.",
      "I want to ask you a little bit, though, about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former Deputy National Security Adviser for President Biden Joe \u2013 Jon Finer just wrote a piece in \"The Atlantic.\"",
      "And he said that, while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes: \"We did far too little far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\"",
      "Do you agree with him? And do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position.",
      "With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in.",
      "I think \u2013 it's something that I hope that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But do you agree with this self-criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We should be doing more, and we should have done more, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "I want to also ask you\u2026",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think everybody should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: \u2026 have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense, when it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid, when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck.",
      "And they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid into the people of Gaza, who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And that can be changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "A bit of a delay there.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Congressman Mike Lawler is standing by.",
      "So, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York.",
      "Good to have you here, Congressman.",
      "There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland. And that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The president encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well.",
      "Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less. And mine wasn't even one of them. Despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat. I won by six and a half points.",
      "So, when you look at the map across the country, the fact is, roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts, they're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and, therefore, they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that, obviously, reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond.",
      "But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year. In 2024, at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become speaker \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting. Despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution.",
      "So, now, New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: So, this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states, trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the president's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the president of the United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Look, obviously it's going to be a fight. But this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid-decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress, like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974, never held a job outside of elected office, it's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform.",
      "So, I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know, there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties because, frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority, period.",
      "On the question, though, that we have been \u2013 also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The president of the United States has mentioned New York as another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Well, crime has been a major problem in New York for years. And Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but do you want National Guard troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized \u2013 Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So, that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80 percent of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution. That 80 percent of these individuals are released back out on to the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington, D.C., 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.",
      "So, when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime? This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well \u2013 no, but that's a local \u2013 that's a local issue that would need to get changed.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: No, but this \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But in terms of the question on the troops, you'd rather troops than \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: But \u2013 but \u2013 but, Margaret, this is why the homicide rate is so high.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: FBI agents or ATF agents or DEAL agents? You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City, you would rather National Guardsmen who have to be trained to police?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I want \u2013 I want all of the above. No. No, no, don't \u2013 don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above. The FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime.",
      "I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation, enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I led that effort. And the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington, D.C., only 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous. And it's exactly why the president is cracking down on crime in major cities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York state that \u2013 that matters. A good amount of money from that chips bill went to New York.",
      "On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore. The president wants to buy a 10 percent stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have U.S. taxpayers as a \u2013 as a shareholder, own 10 percent.",
      "As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Generally speaking, no. I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: In the aftermath of the collapse of the market in '08, the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I think what the president is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel \u2013",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: To manufacture chips.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to \u2013",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: That is critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Yes.",

      "Good morning to you.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN (President, Queens College, Cambridge University and Chief Economic Adviser, Allianz): Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we saw the \u2013 the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon. But he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So, why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct, the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability. And the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side and, therefore, an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said, \"significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system.\" \"Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth.\" And there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point. But it's a lot of uncertainty.",
      "Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if basically he's saying, throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent. And, therefore, he has tended to be late.",
      "Look, there is something promising in our future. And that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in A.I., in life sciences, in robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds. And that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawler just before you. And that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chipmaker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president of the United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10 percent stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so. Margaret, look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing. And that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what the U.S. is saying now is we \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which were paid back.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back. But at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas.",
      "The most important distinction, if I may here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10 percent, but it must not control how this company manages its affairs. Because once we go down that road, that is a really dangerous road, and that will (ph) eat way at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the commerce secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for.",
      "I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve chair, which you've nodded to, but the president is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her, without publicly disclosed evidence, of mortgage fraud, and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell encouraging her to be removed.",
      "Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, these allegations are unproven. And it's important to stress that.",
      "Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So, what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that have resulted in these four resignations.",
      "But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. An independence central bank is critical to the well-being of the economy. And there's lots of reasons for that. So, you know, one has to distinguish between the two, I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information and is \u2013 is denying wrongdoing here.",
      "But just the fact that it is the president directing the attention towards her, doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop, this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I \u2013 my fear, and my concern, is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",

      "We'll be back in a moment.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday by a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing manmade famine and that those conditions will expand soon.",
      "UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment.",
      "Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us.",
      "We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation, so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL (Executive Director, UNICEF): Well, thank you, Margaret.",
      "Let \u2013 let me say this. You know, it's \u2013 it's been now almost two years since October 7th. And since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for \u2013 for months and months and months, which is the terrible famine.",
      "You know, we've estimated, at this point, that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who have died from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying, beware, right? This \u2013 this famine is just right around the corner and it's \u2013 it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know, it's so \u2013 it's shocking that it's happened because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising.",
      "And what it means really is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image, children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where, you know, suddenly they're \u2013 they're \u2013 they're all quiet. Children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry. And to see that happen and \u2013 especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid into these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the U.N. data is flawed. The prime minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice.",
      "Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot. Journalists who live inside Gaza. Because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know what you're saying is fact?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, let me say two things about that. One is, the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people. And they monitor this as they go and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-laden deaths. So, it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate.",
      "I would also say, to me, it's \u2013 it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, all right. I \u2013 I \u2013 I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not?",
      "First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming. You should see it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absence of that, we're going to have to rely on the \u2013 the data that we have, the people who were there. And I can tell you from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean I have spoken to our staff and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived. Many thousands of children who have had amputations and are \u2013 you know, I mean just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussions, stop the arguing and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children. Make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a decent future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 and the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out.",
      "On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jack Lieu, and another Mideast envoy, have said the U.N. agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why \u2013 why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, I \u2013 the \u2013 the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, U.N. had 400 places where we \u2013 we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, OK. And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food. People are getting shot. It's a \u2013 it's a terrible situation. And it doesn't work. It's not working that well.",
      "Now, look, I don't \u2013 I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our \u2013 let us do our work too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say \"we,\" it's not just UNICEF, it's the U.N., it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that gets to the people who need it. And I \u2013 you know, do both. I'm fine with that. But at least make sure the humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that. Nobody wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. He did indeed.",
      "I want to ask you as well about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good. And we need them to step up and do more.",
      "Sudan, as you say, it's the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the U.S. really can make a much bigger difference if they try to \u2013 to do this work and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here when you don't get \u2013",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: It's horrible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",

    "summary": "Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a broader push to crack down on crime.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president has offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a push to crack down on crime that began in the nation's capital in recent weeks and could extend to other major cities.",
      "\"While the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime. But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to federalize the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month and deployed the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "Upon announcing the moves, the president outlined that the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities, though the president has unique authority over the D.C. National Guard because the district is controlled by the federal government. He referenced crime rates in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Baltimore and Oakland.",
      "Last week, Moore, a Democrat, sent a letter to Mr. Trump inviting him to attend a public safety walk in Maryland, while touting the state's investments in local law enforcement and other efforts to address crime under his administration. In 2025, Baltimore has seen a 22% decrease in homicides from last year, according to the Baltimore Police Department.",
      "The governor said Sunday that \"the reason that I asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes and these 1980s scare tactics.\"",
      "\"We know we have work to do,\" Moore said. \"If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work, and what tactics is just theatrics.\"",
      "Moore's appearance on \"Face the Nation\" came shortly after Mr. Trump took aim at the governor on Truth Social Sunday morning, responding to the mayor's request by saying, \"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a 'walk.'\"",
      "Although Mr. Trump dismissed Moore's suggestion, he said last week that he would be joining federal authorities in D.C. \"on patrol.\" He instead visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast D.C.",
      "\"Wes Moore's record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other 'Blue States' are doing,\" the president added. \"But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the 'troops,' which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.\"",
      "The push in D.C. followed the president's move to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles in June amid heated protests over immigration raids, prompting a lawsuit from the California governor, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and called it an illegal \"power grab.\" Mr. Trump and Newsom's sparring has escalated as Newsom's public profile as a potential 2028 candidate has grown.",
      "Moore said Sunday that the operation in D.C. is \"not scalable,\" saying \"you're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city.\" He also argued that the crackdown on crime in the district is \"not sustainable,\" \"deeply disrespectful\" to the National Guard, and \"unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"There is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this,\" Moore added.",
      "The Maryland governor acknowledged that crime must be addressed, while recalling the aftermath of a mass shooting in Baltimore early in his tenure as governor.",
      "\"I said at that point, 'I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer,'\" Moore said. \"And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible.\"",

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority. Period. On the question, though, that we have been- also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The President of the United States has mentioned New York is another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars, and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Crime has been a major problem in New York for years, and Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Do you want National Guard troops?-- ,",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized- Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard's troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime. When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80% of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution, that 80% of these individuals are released back out onto the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington DC, 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. So when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime?",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, but that's a local--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- that's a local issue that would need to get changed. But in terms of the question on the troops--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You'd rather troops than FBI agents or ATF agents or DEA agents. You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City. You would rather National Guardsmen --",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- I want- I want all of the above.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who have trained to be trained to police?",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime. I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. I led that effort, and the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime, and yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington D.C., only 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous, and it's exactly why the President is cracking down on crime in major cities, and as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York State that matters. A good amount of money from that CHIPs bill went to New York. On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore, the President wants to buy a 10% stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have US taxpayers as a shareholder, own 10%. As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Generally speaking, no, I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts, when we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the- in the aftermath of the collapse of the market and '08 the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that. I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back."

There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed, the Pentagon did not explain why. In addition, the Navy Reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed. Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings, and they come on the heels of firings earlier this year, of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of Naval Operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things, one of the strengths of America's military, are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks, who have the training, the expertise, to be able to do the jobs. And what we don't want is political people in those jobs, who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze, and we're going to try to get that back up, if we can. The Senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan. So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan. We- we lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator. Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday, this internationally recognized body, backed by the UN, the IPC. It tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a man-made famine underway in Gaza. This is a very rare designation, only four other times has one been designated. The country you are in, Jordan, called it a \"shameful failure of humanity\" that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think is- it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen. One of the- we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is an- it funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration. They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable. Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he's doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it, quote, \"a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\" That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor, and the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it. But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death, because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that, they're getting ready to do another- or, they've already started, planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people. So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in, to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I understand your criticism right now. I want to ask you a little bit though about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former deputy national security adviser for President Biden Joe- Jon Finer, just wrote a piece in the Atlantic, and he said that while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes \"we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\" Do you agree with him, and do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position. With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in. I think it's something that, I hope, that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but do you agree with this self criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We should be doing more and we should have done more. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I want to also ask you--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think everybody--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: --should have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense. When it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck, and they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck, when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's- that's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid in to the people of Gaza who are starving. And that can be changed. All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senators Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan. Bit of a delay there. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday about a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing man-made famine, and that those conditions will expand soon. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment. Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us. We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation- so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real-world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, thank you, Margaret. Let me say this: You know, it's been, now, almost two years since October 7th, and since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage, and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for months and months and months, which is a terrible famine. You know, we've estimated at this point that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who die from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying we beware, right, this- this famine is just right around the corner, and it's- it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know. It's so- it's shocking that it's happened, because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising. And what it means, really, is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image. Children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where you know suddenly they're all quiet. The children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry, and to see that happen, and especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid in to these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the UN data is flawed. The Prime Minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice. Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot- journalists who live inside Gaza, because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know that what you're saying is fact?",
      "RUSSELL: Let me say two things about that. One is the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people, and they monitor this as they go, and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-related deaths, so it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate. I would also say it- to me, it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, right? I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not? First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean, we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming, you should be it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absent that, we're going to have to rely on the data that we have the people who were there, and I can tell you, from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean, I have spoken to our staff, and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived, many thousands of children who have had amputations, and are, you know, it's just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just- almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussion, stop arguing, and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children, make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a distant future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out. On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people: The former US Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, and another Mid-East Envoy have said the UN agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why- why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, I- the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, the UN had 400 places where we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, okay? And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food, people are getting shot. It's a terrible situation, and it doesn't work. It's not working that well. Now look, I don't- I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our let us do our work, too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say we, it's not just UNICEF, it's the UN, it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that it gets to the people who need it. And I, you know, do both. I'm fine with that, but at least make sure that humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly, and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that nobody wants that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did indeed. I want to ask you, as well, about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good, and we need them to step up and do more. Sudan, as you say, is the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of Cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean, it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the US really can make a much bigger difference if they try to do this work, and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here? When you don't look --",
      "RUSSELL: Oh, it's horrible. First of all, they're not getting food. They're facing horrible sexual violence. I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart, and it's devastating, and the results, as you say, will last for generations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for sharing that. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside DC police forces. And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future? Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned is needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore, and joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore. Thank you for being here.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're here in DC- there are guardsmen from six different states on the street. The mission is, quote, 'beautification, duty and support.' The defense secretary has author- authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of DC. Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Well, there's- there's plenty of reasons. You know one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their national guards to Washington, DC. So who's going to- who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment, and for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big government approach in the way they're conducting public safety. The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful. And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the President's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans- is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by Federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received. When- when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need- where you need a surge of supports for- for traumas and disasters that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this, and this is a direct deflection that the President is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the President watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing because he's tweeting about you- or truthing, I guess. He says the Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a 'nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him,' and he's talking about 'crime ridden Baltimore.' It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime. He says it's a 'bad one.' He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby DC. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it. Is the reality here is- you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOV. MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day, and I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation. So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local- with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history. Over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOV. MOORE: No that came from both federal and state money, and also Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. Attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges. And the results have been- have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20% since I have been the governor, and the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet. And so the reason that I've asked the President to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance. This- these tropes, in these 1980s scare- scare tactics. And you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called 'We Our Us' who is a violence intervention group. And they say we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel. Because while the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime, but it's falling on deaf ears of the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The President's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore is the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis. Fourth highest murder rate. To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the Governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis--",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0--And we know we have work to do. We know- if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your- the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help-- he doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though, he says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF, do you need more federal help in policing if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the President to stop cutting funding. Because if you look at the President's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore. That it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons. Those are actually real, tangible things that the President of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is- President Trump says so as well, possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He spent a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I've been on his mind a lot of times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020 when the you know idea was defund the police.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. And yet the President spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in, and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected. And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore, because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father? And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the President of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work and we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not 'presidential timber' at all. I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah, I've been very clear. I'm not running for president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it's interesting that- but it's interesting the President seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people, and that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland. Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you brought up immigration one of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S. This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOV. MOORE: And the- what we know is that- you know, and all we're asking for, is that the constitution be followed on this. The constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues, and when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the President manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the President is using to just- working to exploit the brokenness. And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process. I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the Secretary of Homeland Security who is trying to be judge, Juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case. I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting or gerrymandering, as some people know it. You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one- one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah. When I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah because and I think- and I think we have to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes, and I think- and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the President of the United States very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes. We're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different, but Democrats redistrict you know this, Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where- where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps. And we also need to make sure that if the President of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections, because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent- they have a Republican representative that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think if you look at maps across the country, less than 10% of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature. Less than 10%. And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30% so that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the U.S. economy. Mohamed El-Erian is the Chief Economic Advisor at Allianz, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich, Connecticut. Good morning to you.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we saw the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon, but he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability, and the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side, and therefore an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system. Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth, and there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point, but it's a lot of uncertainty. Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if, basically, he's saying throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent, and therefore he has tended to be late. Look, there is something promising in our future, and that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in AI in life sciences and robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds, and that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawe- Lawler just before you, and that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chip maker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE STARTS]",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:",
      "He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10% stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so, Margaret. Look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing, and that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what they are saying now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Which were paid back--",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back, but at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas. The most important distinction, if I may, here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10% but it must not control how this company manages its affair, because once we go down that road that is a really dangerous road, and that would eat away at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic, entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the Commerce Secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for. I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve Chair, which you've nodded to, but the President is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her without publicly disclosed evidence of mortgage fraud and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell, encouraging her to be removed. Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So these allegations are unproven, and it's important to stress that. Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that has resulted in these four resignations. But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. And an independent central bank is critical to the well being of the economy, and there's lots of reasons for that. So you know, one has to disting- distinguish between the two. I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information, and is denying wrongdoing here. But just the fact that it is the President directing the attention towards her doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful, and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I- my fear and my concern is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there. We'll be back in a moment."

    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:48:31 -0400",
    "summary": "The Justice Dept. released transcripts of Deputy AG Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "The transcripts \u2014 which run for over 300 pages \u2014 came after Blanche traveled to Florida last month to meet with Maxwell, following pushback over the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case's fallout. The release of the transcripts came as the Justice Department also turned over thousands of pages of files in the Epstein case to the House Oversight Committee, which said it would publish, after child sexual abuse material and any information identifying victims is redacted.",
      "The Justice Department also released audio recordings of the Blanche-Maxwell conversation.",
      "The interview came as Maxwell serves a 20-year prison sentence on charges that she helped Epstein recruit and abuse underage victims. She is asking the Supreme Court to review her case, arguing she should be covered by a non-prosecution deal that federal prosecutors cut with Epstein almost two decades ago.",
      "At the outset, Blanche told Maxwell the interview was not part of a \"cooperation deal.\" He said that she had immunity during their conversations, meaning the government wouldn't use anything she said against her, but he made no promises to ask the judge in Maxwell's case for leniency. He did say that the government could prosecute her if she made false statements during the interview.",
      "\"By you meeting with us today, we're really just meeting, I'm not promising to do anything,\" he said.",
      "What do the Maxwell-Blanche transcripts say?",
      "Throughout the interviews, Blanche asked Maxwell about her relationship with Epstein and others in the late financier's orbit. He also asked about some of the allegations made against her and Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",
      "In some cases, the names of accusers appear to be redacted.",
      "Maxwell said she may have first met President Trump in 1990. She said her father, British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, was \"friendly with him and liked him very much,\" and he was fond of Mr. Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump.",
      "Later in the interview, Blanche asked about Maxwell and Epstein's relationships with famous people, including Mr. Trump. She said Mr. Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me,\" adding that \"I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the President now.\" She also said Mr. Trump and Epstein \"seemed friendly,\" but she \"only ever saw them in social settings,\" not private settings.",
      "She said she \"never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"",
      "She also claimed she \"can't ever recollect\" recruiting somebody from Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club to give Epstein a massage. Late Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre had alleged that Maxwell recruited her while she worked at Mar-a-Lago in the early 2000s. Mr. Trump told reporters last month he cut off ties with Epstein after he \"stole\" employees from Mar-a-Lago, including Giuffre.",
      "She also spoke about former President Bill Clinton, whom she claimed was \"my friend, not Epstein's friend.\" She noted that she attended Chelsea Clinton's wedding with her then-boyfriend, Ted Waitt. She said she did not believe Clinton ever received a massage while the former president was with Epstein. And she told Blanche that Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane, but did not visit Epstein's private island.",
      "Maxwell did not appear to accuse Clinton or Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior.",
      "Maxwell also appears to address Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein and a person whose name is redacted. From context, that person appears to be Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually assaulted her as a minor after she traveled to London with Epstein. Andrew had denied the allegations, but settled a lawsuit brought by Giuffre out of court.",
      "When asked about Andrew's relationship with the accuser, she responds, \"what's an even bigger word than bullshit?\" She claimed a famous photo showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre as Maxwell smiles in the background was \"fake.\" She said \"categorically\" that she \"never, at any time, set Andrew up to have relations with her or any other human being ever.\"",
      "Blanche asked her briefly about several other people whom she claimed to know, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Alan Dershowitz and now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with whom she said she went \"dinosaur bone hunting.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News on Saturday through a spokesperson, the Giuffre family, the family said they are \"outraged\" by what they heard, and alleged that: \"The content of these transcripts is in direct contradiction with felon Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction for child sex trafficking.\"",
      "\"During DAG Todd Blanche's bizarre interview, she is never challenged about her court-proven lies, providing her a platform to rewrite history,\" the Giuffre family's statement said. \"This travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\"",
      "The Giuffre family also said that by sending Maxwell to a minimum security prison, the Justice Department sends \"a disturbing message that child sex trafficking is acceptable and will be rewarded.\"",
      "Maxwell describes her relationship with Epstein",
      "In 1991, Maxwell said she struck up a friendship with Epstein. Maxwell was asked by Blanche in detail about her sexual relationship with Epstein, which she says started in 1992. She told the deputy attorney general that it is a \"misnomer\" that she was with Epstein consistently as a partner, and that she did not know he had other girlfriends until the Epstein flight logs were released.",
      "\"Contemporaneously, I absolutely did not know,\" about other women Epstein was with, Maxwell said, adding that by 1999, their relationship had \"foundered.\"",
      "Maxwell told Blanche that despite their physical relationship ending, she was still being paid by the disgraced financier, and that the two occasionally shared a bed together as \"friends with benefits, if you will, just not sex.\"",
      "Maxwell said at first she was paid $25,000 a year to work for Epstein, starting in 1992, and by the end of the payments in 2009, she was being paid $250,000 per year. Between 2010 and Epstein's 2019 death, Maxwell said her relationship with him was \"almost nonexistent,\" though she acknowledges they exchanged occasional phone calls and emails.",
      "She acknowledged to Blanche that she helped Epstein find people to give him massages at home \u2014 but she said she met them in \"legitimate spas\" and did not believe any of the people she found were under the age of 18. She also claimed it \"never would cross my mind\" that those people were asked to perform sexual favors for Epstein.",
      "At other points, Blanche asked Maxwell about Epstein's career on Wall Street \u2014 a persistent focus of speculation. She noted former Victoria's Secret CEO Lex Wexner was \"one very famous\" financial client of Epstein's, and said former JPMorgan Chase banker Jes Staley was \"business partners\" with Epstein. But she said she was \"not part of Epstein's business world, except tangentially.\"",
      "Maxwell addresses Epstein's case \u2014 and death",
      "Maxwell told Blanche there is \"no list,\" referring to the conspiracy theory that Epstein maintained a black book of clients who engaged in sexual activity with minors on his properties.",
      "She speculated that she does not believe that Epstein died by suicide in jail, but she also doesn't think anybody on the outside caused him to be killed. She noted that, in the prison where she served at the time, \"somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary\" (she was moved to a lower-security facility following the interview).",
      "\"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation,\" Maxwell said, adding that she does \"not have any reason to believe that\" he was killed to cover up information Epstein had.",
      "\"I also think it's ludicrous, because if that -- I also happen to think if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail. And if they were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he would've been a very easy target,\" Maxwell said.",
      "Maxwell said law enforcement did not contact her during an initial investigation into Epstein in Florida in the 2000s, and she didn't discuss the case with Epstein. That probe controversially ended with federal authorities in Miami agreeing not to prosecute him, in exchange for Epstein pleading guilty to prostitution in state court. That deal is now key to Maxwell's efforts to appeal her criminal conviction, as she claims she's covered by a clause in the non-prosecution agreement that covers \"any potential co-conspirators.\"",
      "Maxwell's attorney David Oscar Markus thanked the Trump administration for releasing the transcripts in a statement posted to X. He also insisted that Maxwell is innocent.",
      "\"Ms. Maxwell answered every question. She did not refuse to respond and did not dodge any question. She supported her answers with documents and other objective evidence. Her demeanor and credibility are clear for anyone to hear,\" Markus wrote.",

      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to dozens of \"sanctuary\" cities and counties \u2014 covering several of the largest cities in the U.S.",
      "The judge had previously ruled in April that it was unconstitutional for President Trump to freeze funding for local governments that limit their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 commonly known as sanctuary cities. That ruling applied to more than a dozen cities and counties that had sued the Trump administration for threatening to cut off funding, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Seattle.",
      "On Friday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended his order to dozens of other places that joined the lawsuit. Those include the second- and third-largest cities in the U.S. \u2014 Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 as well as Boston, Baltimore, Denver and Albuquerque.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement: \"The government \u2014 at all levels \u2014 has the duty to protect American citizens from harm. Sanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement at the expense of the safety and security of Americans citizens. We look forward to ultimate vindication on the issue.\"",
      "As Mr. Trump seeks to dramatically boost arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants, top administration officials have pushed local governments to assist \u2014 and they've sought to punish so-called sanctuary jurisdictions with laws on the books that prevent police from helping ICE.",
      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump ordered\u00a0his administration to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, the president ordered that federal funding shouldn't \"facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration,\" and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will not offer grants to sanctuary cities. The administration argues sanctuary cities are interfering with federal law enforcement and making it harder for ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals.",
      "The cities and counties that are suing the administration call those policies an \"abuse of power\" and allege they violate the Tenth Amendment, which says any powers that aren't given to the federal government should be reserved to the states. They argue that local governments are entitled to choose not to assist ICE, often casting sanctuary policies as a way of building trust between police and local residents whose immigration status may make them wary of reporting crimes.",
      "\"In flagrant disregard of the law, President Trump seeks once again to punish those who disagree with him, coerce local authorities, and commandeer them into carrying out his agenda,\" the cities' lawsuit says.",
      "The Trump administration's moves against sanctuary cities have generated a flurry of lawsuits, including one suit filed earlier this week by 20 states over the Justice Department's decision to tie crime victim grants to immigration enforcement.",
      "The Justice Department has also vowed to sue dozens of alleged sanctuary jurisdictions, including both cities and states. The administration sued New York City and the state of Illinois over their sanctuary policies earlier this year, though the Illinois suit was tossed out by a judge last month.",

      "A native of El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months, before being returned to the U.S. and jailed while awaiting trial on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "In a legal filing Saturday, Abrego Garcia's lawyers revealed that the Trump administration had offered their client a \"last-ditch\" plea deal that would see him sent to Costa Rica after the completion of his criminal sentence. They submitted in federal court a letter from a Costa Rican government official that said the Central American country had agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and provide him legal status there.",
      "But after Abrego Garcia declined that deal and was released from pre-trial detention, his lawyers confirmed they were notified by the Trump administration that he could face deportation to Uganda instead. Abrego Garcia was also directed to show up to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore on Monday morning. His lawyers said he has been told he has until then to accept the Costa Rica deal, or it will no longer be on the table.",

Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled last month that the government must give him 72 hours' notice if it plans to initiate deportation proceedings.

      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also played a role in higher costs, disrupting international energy supply chains and causing rates to go up in the U.S. Rapid growth in data centers and newer electrified forms of technology mean the nation will need 15% more capacity \u2014 or 120 gigawatts \u2014 by the end of the decade to keep pace, Gramlich estimated.",
      "The increasing demand is a big reason why the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0expects residential electricity rates to increase steadily by as much as 18% in the next few years, far outstripping the annual inflation rate of about 2.7%.",
      "The fastest way to bring rates down would be to increase supply, but there are challenges.",
      "U.S. falling behind on transmission",
      "Gramlich, in recent testimony before Congress, said there's no shortage of fuel to add to the grid \u2014 it's a shortage of transmission that's the major problem.",
      "At the end of 2023, there were more than 2,600 gigawatts of energy waiting to get connected, representing over twice the current installed capacity of the U.S. power grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. And 95% of it was generated by solar, wind, and battery storage.",
      "To meet growing electricity needs, the U.S. needs to expand transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and even that may need to triple by 2050, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Energy.",
      "\"If we can get a lot of transmission built, then I think we can meet the AI-driven data center demands,\" Gramlich said.",
      "AI data centers consume far more power from the grid than regular data centers, says Norman Bashir, a fellow at MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium, where researchers are studying the impact of generative AI on the grid.",
      "\"AI data centers are much more power intensive,\" Bashir told CBS News Boston last month. \"So, if you have a normal data center, an AI data center would be up to 10 times more power intensive.\"",
      "Role of tariffs and equipment shortages",
      "Beyond the transmission backlog, Gramlich says tariffs and equipment shortages are making energy projects more expensive. One example \u2014 gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that's holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.",
      "\"The price of an actual turbine has almost tripled,\" Gramlich said. And the wait time for a gas turbine is around three or four years \u2014 even as long as seven, according to a May\u00a0 analysis by S&P Global.",
      "Energy sources",
      "Over the past decade, the nation's energy mix has increasingly grown to favor natural gas and renewables, like wind, solar and hydropower, that have become much cheaper to produce. New nuclear plants won't be on line before 2030, Gramlich said, and coal is becoming less economically viable because of maintenance and update costs required to address pollution concerns.",
      "\"That leaves wind and solar and battery storage that can help in this decade,\" Gramlich told CBS News.",
      "But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels. Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.",
      "\"If things keep going like this, [utility bills] are gonna be higher next year,\" Gramlich said.",
      "Trump energy policies projected to raise prices",
      "Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump issued a \"National Energy Emergency\" executive order, arguing the country needs \"reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation's manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.\"",
      "Most of the actions tied to that order have gutted renewable energy generation and are bolstering fossil fuel development.",
      "The passage of Trump's signature legislation, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to make energy more expensive, impact jobs, and make it more difficult to meet rising energy demand, according to analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.",
      "OBBBA will change the tax code, increasing generation costs, resulting in a drop in power generation capacity of 340 gigawatts by 2035, says Michael O'Boyle, acting policy team director of Energy Innovation in an email to CBS News. To put that in perspective, 1 gigawatt typically powers 750,000 homes, so 340 gigawatts could power about 255 million homes.",
      "O'Boyle estimates wholesale energy prices will increase by 74% by 2035, resulting in a $170 annual increase in the average household energy bill. Some 760,000 jobs could be lost by 2030, and the states that are expected to see the biggest impacts on energy cost increases and job losses from the OBBBA are South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina.",
      "The Energy Department criticized the analysis and its support of renewables arguing, \"The OBBBA ensures taxpayers will no longer be forced to subsidize intermittent energy sources like wind and solar \u2013 subsidies that have only resulted in more expensive, less reliable energy,\" said Ben Dietderich, the department's press secretary and chief spokesman, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Ending Biden-era clean energy policies",
      "Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects,\u00a0according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the president and Congress is making it harder for Americans to have access to the cheapest, cleanest, quickest to deploy power there is,\" said Bob Keefe, E2's executive director.",
      "\"By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,\" Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. Grumet cited EIA data and noted, \"The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.\"",
      "Trump admin. keeping fossil fuel generation alive",
      "To address rising energy demand, the Energy Department has ordered some utility companies to keep coal power plants open beyond their retirement dates, an action that could cost more than $3.1 billion a year by 2028, according to analysis by Gramlich's firm, Grid Strategies.",
      "\"These coal plants are basically uneconomic in the market. Each year, they incur tens of millions of dollars of maintenance just to stay operating,\" said Gramlich.",
      "Those costs to extend the life of coal plants will be borne by ratepayers, according to a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.",
      "Coal plants are generally planned for retirement when their operating cost exceeds their expected revenue or their value to the electric grid, the EIA\u00a0has pointed out. Coal-fired plants, which produce high levels of CO2 emissions, have been under pressure to be phased out in many states, in particular, those with clean energy goals. According to the EIA, natural gas and clean energy sources are providing a growing share of the nation's electricity, while coal has been waning. By the end of 2023, the maximum potential power plant output for coal was 15.2%, down from 45% in 1990.",
      "If additional fossil fuel-based plants delay retirement dates \u2014 28% were expected to be retired by 2035 \u2014 the bill to ratepayers could grow to more than $6 billion.",
      "Still, Energy Secretary Chris Wright supports the administration's efforts to keep fossil fuel generation online longer.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,\" he said in a statement, upon releasing a report on the U.S. grid's reliability. \"If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.\"",

      "FBI agents were also seen exiting a downtown Washington, D.C., building where Bolton's political action committee, John Bolton PAC, is located. Late Friday morning, the FBI confirmed agents were on site at his office for \"court authorized activity.\" The Associated Press reported that after the search at Bolton's home had begun, he was seen in the lobby of the building, talking to two people wearing FBI vests. Agents were seen taking bags into the office building through a back entrance.",
      "Bolton did not respond to multiple attempts to reach him. He was seen returning to his home after 2 p.m. ET. Just before he arrived, FBI agents could be seen carrying a number of boxes from his house. The New York Post first reported Bolton's home was being searched by the FBI.",
      "President Trump claimed Friday that he only found out about the search of Bolton's house when he saw it on TV. During a brief visit to the People's House museum, he told reporters he thought he'd be briefed on it by the Justice Department \"probably sometime today.\" The president called Bolton\"not very smart\" and said that \"we're gonna find out\" if he's \"a very unpatriotic guy.\"",
      "He claims that he tells AG Bondi and others \"I don't want to know\" and \"you have to do what you have to do,\" adding that he \"could be the one starting it\" but feels it's better coming from DOJ.",

The first Trump administration tried to stop the publication of the book and later sued him for the profits. The Justice Department opened a criminal inquiry into whether Bolton had published classified information, claiming he had failed to complete a prepublication review.",
      "In June 2020, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth denied the Justice Department's effort to stop the publication of Bolton's book, but after reviewing the classified materials at issue, said in his ruling that Bolton \"likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations.\"",
      "\"Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States,\" Lamberth also wrote. \"He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability.\"",

    "story": [
      "Less than two weeks after a gunman opened fire at CDC headquarters in Atlanta, the agency is facing renewed turmoil after leaders announced a new panel to review the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. At the same time, staff are reporting harassment in the wake of the attack and absorbing the impact of more than 600 job cuts that have dismantled entire public health programs.",
      "This week, officials confirmed that the suspect \u2014 who fired hundreds of rounds at the CDC's main campus on Aug. 8, killing a police officer \u2014 had attempted to enter the CDC visitors center two days prior, in what investigators believe was reconnaissance.",
      "The shooting came just days after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. revoked federal funding for mRNA vaccine research \u2014 a move celebrated by anti-vaccine groups. Investigators have said the suspect was fixated on distrust of COVID vaccines.",
      "In the days since, employees say they have been targeted with harassing phone calls. Callers have asked, \"Are you resilient?\" before playing the sound of gunfire. The taunts, drawn from the agency's own post-shooting messaging, have left staff shaken.",
      "Against this backdrop, the CDC announced a new panel chaired by MIT professor Retsef Levi to investigate concerns raised by critics of COVID mRNA vaccines. Restef himself has been outspoken in his criticism of the vaccines. Leadership framed it as an effort to counter misinformation, but many employees view it as a concession to disinformation narratives.",
      "The panel's creation has deepened unease inside an institution already under strain.",
      "In a letter sent after the attack, staff urged Kennedy to stop spreading inaccurate health information, affirm the CDC's scientific integrity and guarantee workforce safety.",
      "On Thursday, more than 600 CDC staff were officially let go, part of a wave of reductions in force approved by a federal judge earlier this month. Entire branches in the Division of Global HIV and Tuberculosis were eliminated, including teams that worked on preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission. Maternal and child health services, oral health programs, and the CDC's long-running Violence Against Children and Youth Surveys (VACS) were also cut.",
      "The VACS program, nearly two decades old, has provided countries with critical data to measure the prevalence of violence against children and to design interventions in response. \"The data we collected was catalytic,\" one researcher said. \"Overnight, that work is gone.\"",
      "The layoffs extended into injury prevention \u2014 a bitter irony, given that the agency was just targeted in a mass shooting. Staff who studied firearm-related deaths, concussions in young athletes, and fall prevention in older adults were among those dismissed.",
      "\"Injuries are a leading cause of death,\" said a veteran scientist whose unit was eliminated. \"Preventing them will result in fewer deaths. It's that simple. But our entire team was wiped away with a single letter.\"",
      "Other programs eliminated had decades of history. Global HIV prevention and treatment efforts date back to the 1990s, with CDC technical assistance shaping care for millions worldwide. Oral health and maternal-child health branches have likewise been longstanding pillars of domestic prevention work. Their abrupt closure, staff say, erases systems that took generations to build.",
      "Employees say the process itself has been isolating. \"It's been alienating and lonely,\" one longtime worker said. \"People we'd worked with for decades became afraid to even talk to us, and we were just cut off.\" Another added: \"We're not just lazy federal bureaucrats. We've poured our hearts and souls into this work, showing up day after day to keep people safe.\"",

      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",

      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration also said Thursday it is reviewing more than 55 million people who have valid U.S. visas for any violations that could lead to deportation.",
      "In a written answer to a question from the Associated Press, the State Department said all U.S. visa holders, which can include tourists from many countries, are subject to \"continuous vetting,\" with an eye toward any indication they could be ineligible for permission to enter or stay in the United States.",
      "Should such information be found, the visa will be revoked, and if the visa holder is in the U.S., he or she would be subject to deportation.",
      "Since President Trump took office, his administration has focused on deporting migrants illegally in the U.S.\u00a0as well as holders of student\u00a0and visitor exchange visas. The State Department's new language suggests that the continual vetting process, which officials acknowledge is time-consuming, is far more widespread and could mean even those approved to be in the U.S. could abruptly see those permissions revoked.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Energy suppliers are having trouble keeping up with the rapid increase in demand, and consumers in some states are seeing higher monthly bills.",
    "story": [
      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "Gramlich indicated he expects energy prices to remain high for the foreseeable future, predicting that \"two years from now, we're going to see a lot more policy discussion about it.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump says he plans to sign an executive order \"to end mail-in ballots, because they're corrupt.\" Here's what to know about his claims.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump promised Monday to work to end mail-in voting and said work is already underway on an executive order to ban it before the 2026 midterm elections, although the Constitution does not give him this power.",
      "\"We, as a Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots,\" he said during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots.\"",
      "Why does Trump want to ban mail-in ballots?",
      "\"Mail-in ballots are corrupt,\" the president said. He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.",
      "But soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"",
      "\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.",
      "After that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"",
      "In 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.",
      "The White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"",
      "\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.",
      "Trump's impending executive order to stop mail voting \u2014 would it be legal?",
      "In a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "He claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"",
      "But Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.",
      "Trump claims U.S. is the only country that uses mail-in voting. Is that true?",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"",
      "In fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany\u00a0and Denmark are among them.",
      "Mail-in voting in the U.S.",
      "In the U.S., mail voting is widespread:\u00a036 states offer some form of no-excuse mail-in voting \u2014 including 8 states that conduct elections entirely by mail \u2014 while the rest require a documented reason such as illness or military service, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast \u2014 about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.",
      "The topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.' And he said, 'There's not a country in the world that uses it now.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two talked about the 2020 election and that Putin told him, \"You won that election by so much, and that's (mail voting) how [Biden] got it.\" Audits and investigations, including some conducted by Trump supporters and Republican secretaries of state, showed no evidence that the 2020 election results were inaccurate.",
      "David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, pointed out in a statement to CBS News that mail-in voting has been around since the Civil War and said getting rid of mail voting \"is an incredibly bad idea that would make our elections much less secure and vulnerable to interference.\"",
      "\"Requiring states to eliminate or replace the voting machines that confirmed the election of this president, just 15 months before a midterm election and less than a year before primaries, is not possible and would result in chaos,\" said Becker, who is also a CBS News election law contributor.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News in a statement Monday night that \"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York.\"",
      "\"Democrats have eroded faith in our elections with reckless laws, such as unfettered mail-in voting, illegally changing laws to benefit their voters, and slow-walking the counting of votes far past Election Day,\" Fields said.",

      "Tucked away in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, more than 20 species at risk of extinction, including Mongolia's Przewalski's\u00a0horse, which disappeared from the wild at the end of the 1960s, live on the institute's\u00a0grounds. There are red pandas, maned wolves, and clouded leopards, to name a few more.",
      "The institute studies a species' reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration, and conservation sustainability, with the ultimate goals of saving wildlife from extinction and training future conservationalists. In certain cases, the scientists are responsible for breeding and reintroducing them to their habitats.",
      "But those who work to conserve these species and remove them from the endangered species list are still concerned with the rate at which species are vanishing.",
      "\"We're seeing species disappearing at 10, 100, to 1000 times the normal background rate,\" SCBI conservation biologist Melissa Songer\u00a0told CBS News.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature warned in early 2025 that 28%, or more than 47,000, of the world's assessed species are at risk of extinction. That number includes more than just animal species, showing crucial insect, plant and tree species are also threatened.",
      "\"So we think, okay, well, we're losing the species here and there, you know, there's a lot of other species,\" Songer says, \"but the thing is, that when we lose one species, it has cascading effects.\"",
      "A great example of this effect is with the black-footed ferret, which originally inhabited the North American Great Plains but has been endangered since 1967. While the species remains on the endangered list, its population has grown since preservation efforts began at the Institute.",

    "story": [
      "After three catastrophic in-flight failures in a row, SpaceX readied a huge Super Heavy-Starship rocket for launch Sunday evening from the Texas Gulf Coast to put a variety of upgrades to the test and to deliberately stress the vehicle to learn more about its capabilities.",
      "Test flight No. 10 was expected to get underway at 7:30 p.m. ET from SpaceX's Starbase flight and manufacturing facility and the team was in the process of pumping liquid oxygen and methane fuel into the 40-story-tall rocket when the company announced a scrub.",
      "\"Standing down from today's tenth flight of Starship to allow time to troubleshoot an issue with ground systems,\" the company said on X. No other details were provided, including whether the team would make another attempt to get the rocket off the ground.",
      "The flight plan had called for the 30-foot wide, 230-foot tall Super Heavy booster, generating more than 16 million pounds of thrust, to propel the Starship out of the dense lower atmosphere before it would fall away, flip around and head back toward the coast.",
      "During three of the nine previous test flights, the booster flew itself all the way back to its launch pad where giant mechanical arms on the service gantry plucked the descending rocket out of midair. This time around, because of the planned tests, the Super Heavy was expected to descend to splashdown in the Gulf, but it never took off.",
      "SpaceX previously said the primary objectives for the booster test was focused on its landing burn. One of the three center engines used for the final phase of landing was going to be \"intentionally disabled to gather data on the ability for a backup engine from the middle ring to complete a landing burn,\" the company said on its website.",
      "The booster was then going to use two engines toward the end of the descent and hover briefly before dropping to the Gulf.",
      "The 160-foot-tall Starship, meanwhile, powered by six Raptor engines of its own, would have headed for a suborbital trajectory carrying it halfway around the world before a belly-first reentry, a flip back to vertical and a rocket-powered descent to splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Along with deploying eight Starlink simulator satellites, the Starship's flight computer had planned to attempt a variety of other tests, including an in-space engine restart, to verify the performance of numerous upgrades implemented in the wake of the most recent test flight failures.",
      "Working the bugs out of the giant launcher is critical to SpaceX and founder Elon Musk, who designed the ultra-heavy-lift rocket to launch thousands of next-generation Starlinks and other satellites in Earth's orbit and to one day carry settlers and equipment to Mars.",
      "The rocket also is critical to NASA, which is paying SpaceX more than $3 billion to develop a modified version of the Starship upper stage to carry Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon in 2027.",
      "But that flight will require 10 to 20 Super Heavy-Starship flights just to refuel the \"Human Landing System,\" or HLS, lander before it can head to the moon. Transferring thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid nitrogen and oxygen in space has never been attempted.",
      "And it is still not known how SpaceX plans to control propellant temperatures to minimize the amount that will naturally warm up and turn into a gas, which must be vented overboard. SpaceX has provided no details. Musk promised pre-launch update Sunday on the company's plans going forward, but the talk was also canceled with no explanation.",
      "Given the number of flights that must be successfully executed to demonstrate the reliability NASA will expect, the 2027 target date for the Artemis 3 moon landing is considered unrealistic, if not impossible to meet, by many aerospace observers.",
      "China plans to launch its own astronauts on the moon by 2030. It is unclear at this point whether NASA and SpaceX will get back to the moon using the Starship lander before the Chinese plant their own flag on the lunar surface.",
      "Given the sheer size and power of the Super Heavy-Starship \u2014 it has more than twice the thrust of NASA's current Space Launch System, or SLS, moon rocket \u2014 technical problems during development were not unexpected.",
      "But given the short time between now and NASA's first planned Artemis moon landing, the problems have clearly set the program back and cast doubt on the overall mission architecture, especially the requirement for 10 to 20 problem-free flights in short order just to fuel the lander for its flight to the moon.",
      "The first three test flights of the Super Heavy booster and Starship upper stage in 2023 and 2024 ended in catastrophic failures with both stages destroyed, either while still attached to each other or after separation.",
      "The fourth flight in June 2024 was generally successful with the Super Heavy flying itself back to a controlled splashdown in the Gulf while the Starship followed the planned sub-orbital trajectory to splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The ship's fins were damaged by reentry heating, but otherwise worked as required.",
      "The fifth flight in October 2024 was highlighted by a successful Super Heavy return to the launch pad gantry where giant mechanical arms snagged the rocket in mid air. The Starship, meanwhile, managed a second controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean although it again suffered fin damage during reentry.",
      "During the sixth integrated flight test in November 2024, the Super Heavy attempted another return to the launch site but it was diverted to a Gulf splashdown because of launch damage to critical sensors in the pad's capture mechanism. The Starship again flew itself to a controlled Indian Ocean splashdown with minimal flap damage.",
      "But the next three flights, in January, March and May of this year, ended with catastrophic failures. Two Super Heavy boosters successfully returned to the launch site, but the most recent broke up over the Gulf while testing a high angle-of-attack entry.",
      "All three Starships were destroyed after catastrophic malfunctions, including two propellant leaks, an on-board fire and multiple engine failures.",

      "Of special interest to NASA is the performance of an add-on propulsion system consisting of two SpaceX Draco engines, six propellant tanks and a supply of helium to pressurize the system. The hardware is mounted in the Dragon's open-to-space aft trunk section.",
      "\"The space station's altitude slowly decays over time due to the thin amount of atmosphere still at our altitude,\" Spetch said. \"To counteract that drag, we must occasionally raise the altitude of the ISS.\"",
      "The Russians handle the majority of those re-boost operations, delivering the needed propellants and periodically firing thrusters aboard Progress cargo ships and the station itself.",
      "\"With the addition of the boost trunk on this mission, Dragon will also provide this ability to maintain the station's altitude,\" Spetch said. \"The boost kit will help sustain the orbiting lab's altitude starting in September with a series of burns planned periodically throughout the fall of 2025.\"",
      "The CRS-33 Dragon will remain docked to the station until December. During that time, the boost kit will provide the one and a half Progress missions.",
      "Sarah Walker, director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said the boost kit will provide about a quarter of the propulsion needed in one year to maintain the station's 260-mile-high altitude. The first \"burn,\" expected to last about 20 minutes, is planned for Sept. 3.",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 01:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "During its secretive mission, the X-37B will test new laser communications gear and a \"quantum\" navigation sensor.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Thursday, propelling a reusable X-37B Space Force rocket plane into space on a classified long-duration mission. It was the eighth such flight since the program's debut in 2010 and the first since a 434-day mission ended last March.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 roared away from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:50 p.m. EDT, arcing onto a northeasterly trajectory atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust from the booster's nine first-stage engines.",
      "After the spacecraft climbed out of the lower atmosphere, the engines shut down, the first stage fell away, flipped around and re-ignited three engines to reverse course and head back to Florida. Heralded by an attention-getting sonic boom, the booster landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to wrap up its sixth flight.",
      "It was SpaceX's 66th booster landing in Florida and the company's 490th successful recovery overall.",
      "As usual with classified Space Force missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary with the first stage landing and offered no information about the Falcon 9's second stage climb to orbit, when the Boeing-built X-37B was to be released to fly on its own, or any details about its orbit.",
      "The seven previous X-37B missions -- three by the orbiter launched Thursday and four by a twin sister ship -- all carried out long-duration missions ranging from 224 days to nearly 909 days. It's not known how long the X-37B launched Thursday will remain in orbit.",
      "While the flights are generally classified, Space Force and Boeing officials publicly discussed two of the payloads on board.",
      "One  will test high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the  X-37B and small data relay satellites making up a growing  \"proliferated\" space-based communications system.",
      "The tests \"will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force's  ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified  and redundant space architecture,\" said Gen. Chance Saltzman, director of space operations for the U.S. Space Force.",
      "\"In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architecture.\"",
      "The other publicly disclosed payload is a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor designed to determine a spacecraft's precise position in space by \"detecting rotation and acceleration of atoms without reliance on satellite networks like traditional GPS,\" the Space Force said in an on-line description.",
      "\"Whether navigating beyond Earth-based orbits in cislunar space or operating in GPS-denied environments, quantum inertial sensing allows for robust navigation capabilities when GPS navigation is not possible,\" said Space Delta 9 commander Col. Ramsey Horn.",
      "\"Ultimately, this technology contributes significantly to our thrust within the Fifth Space Operations Squadron and across the Space Force guaranteeing movement and maneuverability even in GPS-denied environments.\"",
      "Clad in black heat shield tiles and white insulation blankets, the unpiloted X-37B resembles a mini space shuttle with stubby delta wings and two tail fins extending from either side of the rear of the fuselage. It can be launched atop SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets or United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and Vulcan boosters.",
      "Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Powered by solar cells and batteries, the orbiters feature a small payload bay similar to a space shuttle's that can accommodate a variety of sensors and experiment packages.",
      "The compact spacecraft are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle.",
      "The most recent flight of an X-37B began with a\u00a0launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Dec. 29, 2023. It ended last March 7, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 434 days and six hours in space. Going into Thursday's mission, the two X-37Bs had logged a combined 11-and-a-half years in space across seven flights.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 08:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Tommy Fello struggled to regain function after a stroke affected the left side of his body. A new technology is making a difference.",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.",
      "But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance.",
      "\"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering,\" Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg.",
      "\"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything,\" Fello said.",
      "A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements.",
      "Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.",
      "\"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore,\" Fello said. \"We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'\"",
      "A \"first-of-its-kind technology\"",
      "One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They regulate the body's involuntary functions.",
      "The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises.",
      "Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in \"greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors,\" Nossek said in emailed remarks.",
      "\"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use,\" Nossek said. \"This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population.\"",
      "A 108-person trial\u00a0published in The Lancet in 2021\u00a0found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have \"moderate to severe deficits\" qualify for the device, the company\u00a0said in a fact sheet.",
      "Implant aids in recovery",
      "Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025.",
      "\"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked,\" Fello said.",
      "The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with \"less than 1% chance of any complications.\" Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey.",
      "Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't \"something he could have done before.\" Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.",
      "\"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it,\" he said.",
      "\"The sky's the limit\"",
      "About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and other new technologies may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said.",
      "\"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back,\" Bain said. \"In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery.\"",
      "At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but shared a map that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy.",
      "\"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back,\" Covey said. \"This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down.\"",

      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",

Guard to crack down on\u00a0what he has called\u00a0an \"epidemic of crime.\" Federal agents have also patrolled the city, and the president has asserted control over the local Metropolitan Police Department.",

    "story": [
      "Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind the scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York. Adler \"passed peacefully in his sleep,\" Paradigm Talent Agency's Sarah Shulman said on behalf of his family. No immediate cause was given.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \"The Sopranos,\" on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \"The Good Wife,\" where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\"I'm a creature of nepotism,\" Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \"I got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\"",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \"My Fair Lady\" and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \"Santa Barbara.\"",
      "\"I was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\" he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \"The Public Eye\" and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \"chills\" when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \"Northern Exposure\" paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \"The Sopranos.\"",
      "\"When David was going to do the pilot for 'The Sopranos' he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\" he told Forward in 2015. \"But when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\"",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \"Manhattan Murder Mystery,\" but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \"Rescue Me,\" \"Mad About You,\" \"Transparent\" and guest spots on shows ranging from \"The West Wing\" to \"Broad City.\"",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \"Taller Than a Dwarf\" in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"I do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\" Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \"I wouldn't know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that's when I'll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\"",
      "Adler published a memoir, \"Too Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\" last year. \"I'm ready to go at a moment's notice,\" he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York. Survivors include his four daughters, Shulman said.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \"too goofy-looking\" to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",

      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2,300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside D.C. police forces.",
      "And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future?",
      "Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned as needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore.",
      "And joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic governor, Wes Moore.",
      "Thank you for being here.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE (D-Maryland): Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, there \u2013 here in D.C., there are Guardsmen from six different states on the street.",
      "The mission is \u2013 quote \u2013 \"beautification duty and support.\" The defense secretary has author \u2013 authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but, to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of D.C.",
      "Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Well, there's \u2013 there's plenty of reasons.",
      "You know, one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're \u2013 when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their National Guards to Washington, D.C.",
      "So who's going to \u2013 who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment. And for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big-government approach in the way they're conducting public safety.",
      "The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful.",
      "And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the president's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans, is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this.",
      "And I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received.",
      "When \u2013 when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need \u2013 where you need a surge of supports for \u2013 for traumas and disasters\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this. And this is a direct deflection that the president is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the president watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing, because he's tweeting about you \u2013 or TRUTHing, I guess.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says: \"The Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him.\" And he's talking about \"crime-ridden Baltimore.\" It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime.",
      "He says it's a bad one. He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby D.C. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it.",
      "Is the reality here is you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day. And I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation.",
      "So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local \u2013 with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history, over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: That \u2013 well, no, that came from both federal and state money. And, also, Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges.",
      "And the results have been \u2013 have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past 2.5 years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20 percent since I have been the governor. And the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet.",
      "And so the reason that I have asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, this \u2013 these tropes, in these 1980s scare tac \u2013 scare tactics.",
      "And, you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called We Our Us, who is a violence intervention group. And they say, we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel, because, while the president is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime,.",
      "But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The president's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore has the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis, fourth highest murder rate.",
      "To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis. But\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Correct.",
      "And we know we have work to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: We know \u2013 like, if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your \u2013 the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help. He doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though. He says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF.",
      "Do you need more federal help in policing, if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the president to stop cutting funding, because, if you look at the president's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore, that it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons.",
      "Those are actually real, tangible things\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: \u2026 that the president of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is \u2013 President Trump says so as well \u2013 possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's spending a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I have been on his mind a lot.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020, when the, you know, idea was defund the police.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely.",
      "And, yes, the president spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And, yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected.",
      "And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father?",
      "And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods, who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work.",
      "And we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not presidential timber at all.",
      "I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: No, I have been very clear. I'm not running for president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: But it's interesting that \u2013 but it's interesting. The president seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people.",
      "And that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland.",
      "Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you. You brought up immigration.",
      "One of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S.",
      "This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and the \u2013 what we know is that, you know, and all we're asking for is that the Constitution be followed on this.",
      "The Constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues. And when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the president manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the president is using to just \u2013 working to exploit the brokenness.",
      "And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety, that\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words, rather than\u2026",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process.",
      "I just simply want a court and a judge to decide, what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the president of the United States or the secretary of homeland security, who is \u2013 who is trying to be judge, juror, prosecutor, and executioner inside this case.",
      "I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting, or gerrymandering, as some people know it.",
      "You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one \u2013 one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, I mean, when I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, because. And I think \u2013 and I think we have to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, and I think \u2013 and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is, this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the president of the United States, very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes, we're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different.",
      "But Democrats redistrict. You know this.,",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where \u2013 where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps.",
      "And we also need to make sure that if the president of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters' voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent \u2013 they have a Republican representative, that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: I think, if you look at maps across the country, less than 10 percent of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature, less than 10 percent.",
      "And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30 percent.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: So that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so, yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Yes, we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOVERNOR WES MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Face the Nation will be back in a minute. Stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, New Hampshire Senator Jeanne Shaheen. She joins us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "Good morning, Senator.",
      "I know we have got a bit of a delay here, so I will launch right in.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN (D-New Hampshire): Good morning, or afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, exactly.",
      "You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed. The Pentagon did not explain why.",
      "In addition, the Navy reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed.",
      "Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings.",
      "And they come on the heels of firings earlier this year of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of naval operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things \u2013 one of the strengths of America's military are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks who have the training, the expertise to be able to do the jobs.",
      "And what we don't want is political people in those jobs who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So, it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze. And we're going to try to get that back up if we can. The senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan.",
      "We lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator.",
      "Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday this internationally recognized body backed by the U.N., the IPC \u2013 it tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a manmade famine under way in Gaza. This is a very rare designation. Only four other times has one been designated.",
      "The country you are in, Jordan, called it a shameful failure of humanity, that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three-month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen.",
      "One of the \u2013 we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is a \u2013 funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration.",
      "They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in, in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable.",
      "Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he is doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli prime minister's office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it \u2013 quote \u2013 \"a modern blood libel spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\"",
      "That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate, rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor. And the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it.",
      "But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that. They are getting ready to do another \u2013 or they have already started planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people.",
      "So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I understand your criticism right now.",
      "I want to ask you a little bit, though, about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former Deputy National Security Adviser for President Biden Joe \u2013 Jon Finer just wrote a piece in \"The Atlantic.\"",
      "And he said that, while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes: \"We did far too little far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\"",
      "Do you agree with him? And do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position.",
      "With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in.",
      "I think \u2013 it's something that I hope that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "But do you agree with this self-criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We should be doing more, and we should have done more, absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "I want to also ask you\u2026",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: I think everybody should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: \u2026 have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense, when it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid, when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck.",
      "And they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid into the people of Gaza, who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: And that can be changed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR JEANNE SHAHEEN: All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan.",
      "A bit of a delay there.",
      "We will be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Congressman Mike Lawler is standing by.",
      "So, stay with us.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION.",
      "We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York.",
      "Good to have you here, Congressman.",
      "There's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland. And that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The president encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well.",
      "Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER (R-NY): I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less. And mine wasn't even one of them. Despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat. I won by six and a half points.",
      "So, when you look at the map across the country, the fact is, roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts, they're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and, therefore, they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that, obviously, reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond.",
      "But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year. In 2024, at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become speaker \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting. Despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution.",
      "So, now, New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the House.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: So, this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states, trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the president's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the president of the United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Look, obviously it's going to be a fight. But this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid-decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress, like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974, never held a job outside of elected office, it's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform.",
      "So, I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know, there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties because, frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority, period.",
      "On the question, though, that we have been \u2013 also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The president of the United States has mentioned New York as another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: Well, crime has been a major problem in New York for years. And Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime crisis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but do you want National Guard troops?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized \u2013 Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So, that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80 percent of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution. That 80 percent of these individuals are released back out on to the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington, D.C., 1.7 percent of gun crime convictions result in jail time.",
      "So, when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime? This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate \u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE LAWLER: I led that effort. And the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we saw the \u2013 the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon. But he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So, why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct, the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability. And the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side and, therefore, an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said, \"significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system.\" \"Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth.\" And there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point. But it's a lot of uncertainty.",
      "Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if basically he's saying, throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent. And, therefore, he has tended to be late.",
      "Look, there is something promising in our future. And that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in A.I., in life sciences, in robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds. And that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawler just before you. And that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chipmaker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president of the United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10 percent stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so. Margaret, look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing. And that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what the U.S. is saying now is we \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which were paid back.",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back. But at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas.",
      "The most important distinction, if I may here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10 percent, but it must not control how this company manages its affairs. Because once we go down that road, that is a really dangerous road, and that will (ph) eat way at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the commerce secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for.",
      "I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve chair, which you've nodded to, but the president is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her, without publicly disclosed evidence, of mortgage fraud, and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell encouraging her to be removed.",
      "Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So, these allegations are unproven. And it's important to stress that.",
      "Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So, what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that have resulted in these four resignations.",
      "But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. An independence central bank is critical to the well-being of the economy. And there's lots of reasons for that. So, you know, one has to distinguish between the two, I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information and is \u2013 is denying wrongdoing here.",
      "But just the fact that it is the president directing the attention towards her, doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop, this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I \u2013 my fear, and my concern, is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",

      "Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us.",
      "We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation, so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL (Executive Director, UNICEF): Well, thank you, Margaret.",
      "Let \u2013 let me say this. You know, it's \u2013 it's been now almost two years since October 7th. And since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for \u2013 for months and months and months, which is the terrible famine.",
      "You know, we've estimated, at this point, that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who have died from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying, beware, right? This \u2013 this famine is just right around the corner and it's \u2013 it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know, it's so \u2013 it's shocking that it's happened because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising.",
      "And what it means really is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image, children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where, you know, suddenly they're \u2013 they're \u2013 they're all quiet. Children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry. And to see that happen and \u2013 especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid into these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the U.N. data is flawed. The prime minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice.",
      "Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot. Journalists who live inside Gaza. Because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know what you're saying is fact?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, let me say two things about that. One is, the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people. And they monitor this as they go and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-laden deaths. So, it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate.",
      "I would also say, to me, it's \u2013 it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, all right. I \u2013 I \u2013 I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not?",
      "First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming. You should see it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absence of that, we're going to have to rely on the \u2013 the data that we have, the people who were there. And I can tell you from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean I have spoken to our staff and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived. Many thousands of children who have had amputations and are \u2013 you know, I mean just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussions, stop the arguing and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children. Make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a decent future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And \u2013 and the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out.",
      "On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people, the former U.S. ambassador to Israel, Jack Lieu, and another Mideast envoy, have said the U.N. agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why \u2013 why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, I \u2013 the \u2013 the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, U.N. had 400 places where we \u2013 we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, OK. And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food. People are getting shot. It's a \u2013 it's a terrible situation. And it doesn't work. It's not working that well.",
      "Now, look, I don't \u2013 I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our \u2013 let us do our work too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say \"we,\" it's not just UNICEF, it's the U.N., it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that gets to the people who need it. And I \u2013 you know, do both. I'm fine with that. But at least make sure the humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that. Nobody wants to see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. He did indeed.",
      "I want to ask you as well about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good. And we need them to step up and do more.",
      "Sudan, as you say, it's the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the U.S. really can make a much bigger difference if they try to \u2013 to do this work and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here when you don't get \u2013",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said Sunday that President Trump's rhetoric on crime is \"purely performative\" as the president has offered to send troops to Baltimore amid a push to crack down on crime that began in the nation's capital in recent weeks and could extend to other major cities.",
      "\"While the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime. But it's falling on deaf ears of the president of the United States,\" Moore said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Mr. Trump moved to federalize the District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department earlier this month and deployed the National Guard to the district to assist law enforcement, despite data showing crime has declined in the city in recent years.",
      "Upon announcing the moves, the president outlined that the effort \"will go further,\" saying the administration is \"starting very strongly with D.C.\" and suggesting it could then move to other cities, though the president has unique authority over the D.C. National Guard because the district is controlled by the federal government. He referenced crime rates in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Baltimore and Oakland.",
      "Last week, Moore, a Democrat, sent a letter to Mr. Trump inviting him to attend a public safety walk in Maryland, while touting the state's investments in local law enforcement and other efforts to address crime under his administration. In 2025, Baltimore has seen a 22% decrease in homicides from last year, according to the Baltimore Police Department.",
      "The governor said Sunday that \"the reason that I asked the president to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance, these tropes and these 1980s scare tactics.\"",
      "\"We know we have work to do,\" Moore said. \"If one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work, and what tactics is just theatrics.\"",
      "Moore's appearance on \"Face the Nation\" came shortly after Mr. Trump took aim at the governor on Truth Social Sunday morning, responding to the mayor's request by saying, \"As President, I would much prefer that he clean up this Crime disaster before I go there for a 'walk.'\"",
      "Although Mr. Trump dismissed Moore's suggestion, he said last week that he would be joining federal authorities in D.C. \"on patrol.\" He instead visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast D.C.",
      "\"Wes Moore's record on Crime is a very bad one, unless he fudges his figures on crime like many of the other 'Blue States' are doing,\" the president added. \"But if Wes Moore needs help, like Gavin Newscum did in L.A., I will send in the 'troops,' which is being done in nearby DC, and quickly clean up the Crime.\"",
      "The push in D.C. followed the president's move to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles in June amid heated protests over immigration raids, prompting a lawsuit from the California governor, who did not approve of the use of his state's Guard forces and called it an illegal \"power grab.\" Mr. Trump and Newsom's sparring has escalated as Newsom's public profile as a potential 2028 candidate has grown.",
      "Moore said Sunday that the operation in D.C. is \"not scalable,\" saying \"you're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city.\" He also argued that the crackdown on crime in the district is \"not sustainable,\" \"deeply disrespectful\" to the National Guard, and \"unconstitutional.\"",
      "\"There is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this,\" Moore added.",
      "The Maryland governor acknowledged that crime must be addressed, while recalling the aftermath of a mass shooting in Baltimore early in his tenure as governor.",
      "\"I said at that point, 'I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer,'\" Moore said. \"And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the president of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible.\"",

    "summary": "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! Servers.",
    "story": [
      "Editor's note: This article contains descriptions and an image of hate speech found on the Roblox servers and might be triggering to some readers.",
      "In Roblox, one of the world's largest online gaming platforms, users join to play, create, and be themselves in a virtual world \u2014 but some might be there for a more insidious purpose: to expose youth to hate speech.",
      "Players of \"Spray Paint!\" \u2014 a popular game on Roblox, with over a billion visits, in which players skate and create graffiti art in a virtual skatepark setting \u2014 can bypass moderation by spray painting hate messages across walls, ramps and other virtual game settings, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! servers, which host multiplayer games. There are millions of games on Roblox where players can join servers to play with friends and strangers.",
      "What's happening in \"Spray Paint!\" is not uncommon \u2014 nor surprising. Roblox currently has at least 18 active lawsuits pending nationwide due to inappropriate content found on its games, attorney Matthew Dolman, whose firm is representing individuals in cases against Roblox, told CBS News.",
      "Roblox said in an emailed statement to CBS News that its 24/7 moderation system closely monitors the platform, and that the company takes \"swift action against any content or users found to be in violation.\"",
      "However, hate speech still appears in Roblox games, like Spray Paint, CBS News found. \"Within three minutes of getting in there for the first time, I also saw a swastika,\" said Rachel Franz, the early childhood advocacy program director at the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for children's online safety.",
      "Hate can run rampant across various Roblox games. A group called Active Shooter Studios recreates school shootings at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland and consistently evades efforts to take down recreations, the Anti-Defamation League found in an April report. A lawsuit filed this month alleges that Roblox hosted hundreds of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs-themed games, as well as more than 900 user accounts registered across Roblox with variations of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's name.",
      "\"Roblox is fully aware that these experiences pervade its app, and it allows them to continue to exist unchecked despite the ability to control or eliminate them,\" the lawsuit alleges, and said the effects on children can be devastating.",
      "Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a child protection lawsuit against the platform.",
      "\"Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,\" Murrill, a Republican, alleged in a press release. \"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Roblox said, \"We share Attorney General Murrill's urgency to help keep kids safe because safety has always been our priority,\" adding that it looks forward to working with Murrill to help keep children safe.",
      "\"We share the critically important goal of keeping kids safe online and any assertion otherwise is categorically untrue,\" Roblox's statement said. \"We hold ourselves to the highest standard and work constantly to remove violative content and bad actors.\"",
      "What children are encountering",
      "Predators can troll Roblox, experts say, and other similar gaming platforms, to recruit young players for extremist groups or possibly sexual exploitation.",
      "Children and teens make up more than half of Roblox players, and about 40% of players are under the age of 13, according to a 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Roblox attracts an average of 97.8 million daily active users.",
      "\"If you are a predator, it's very clear that there are opportunities to access vulnerable folks on these platforms,\" Franz said.",
      "When children play the Spray Paint! game, they might see slurs targeting Black and Jewish people and phrases like \"KKK\" and \"Jew\" etched in graffiti on virtual brick walls. In one server, there were over 14 instances of this speech, CBS News found, as well as a reference to the \"Third Reich.\"",
      "The phrase \"I can't breathe,\" the words uttered by George Floyd, who died in 2020 in police custody by an officer later convicted of murder, was written across a virtual brick wall in one server. Some servers had graphic sexual drawings, and in another, there was an instance of suicidal language, CBS News found.",
      "Roblox's chat feature, available in some games, has a filtering system that prevents inappropriate content, like discriminatory speech, from being visible, but in Spray Paint! players can bypass filtering mechanisms by scrawling text via the game's paint feature as opposed to writing in the chat, where content is filtered.",
      "Users must enter their birthday when creating a Roblox account, but the platform doesn't require authentication, meaning adults can pose as children and children can pose as older than they actually are. Kids can converse with other players via the voice chat feature \u2014 which has a minimum age requirement of 13 \u2014but also doesn't require age verification.",
      "Roblox says the company has implemented what it calls a \"trusted flagger program,\" where trusted partners can report \"terrorist content\" in an effort to crack down on hate messages.",
      "Roblox also says on its website that content uploaded to be incorporated into games is evaluated in a multi-step review process to screen for child sexual abuse material and other inappropriate content. If it is identified as fodder for possible child sexual abuse, Roblox says it is automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization focusing on finding missing children and reducing child exploitation.",
      "Roblox has developed an artificial intelligence system that the company says helped submit about 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to NCMEC \u2014 and last year, Roblox submitted 24,522 reports to NCMEC overall.",
      "Roblox says it has a human review team continuously evaluating flagged games and encourages users to report concerning activity. Spray Paint! players have the option to play in \"safe mode,\" which allows them to only view art created by other players who are on their \"friends\" list in the app.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement that \"while no system is perfect,\" the company has implemented safeguards including \"restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, as well as content maturity [l]abels and parental controls.\"",
      "\"We share with our community the critically important goal of keeping everyone safe online and ensuring users have positive experiences on Roblox that align with our strict Community Standards,\" the statement said, adding, \"We continuously innovate to deter bad actors and have launched over 50 safety features since last year.\"",
      "Despite efforts to curb extremism and the targeting of young players, experts and CBS News found that protections remain easy to override.",
      "\"There's a larger question of how you regulate and moderate something that is supposed to encourage creativity and freedom of expression, but actually ends up introducing some really unsafe and truly harmful and disgusting practices,\" Franz said.",
      "A double-edged sword",
      "Allegations in several cases suggest Roblox has also been used to exploit teens and children. A Florida teenager was arrested\u00a0in April for allegedly targeting children on Roblox, where he would demand child sexual abuse material over text messages or the messaging platform Discord. In Texas, a lawsuit filed in April alleges a 13-year-old girl was groomed and sexually exploited on Roblox and later, Discord. Roblox has recently been hit by a spate of lawsuits with similar claims. Dolman said his firm currently has seven cases and is investigating 400 more. Another firm filed a lawsuit earlier this month against Roblox and Discord representing over 400 people.",
      "A man in California was arrested\u00a0in April on kidnapping and sexual misconduct charges in connection with a 10-year-old he is believed to have met through Roblox. Last year, a woman in Florida was arrested for allegedly using Roblox to instruct a 10-year-old to kill an infant by dropping the 2-month-old on a tile floor. The infant was seriously injured.",
      "When asked for a response to the lawsuits, Roblox said in an email that the company is \"deeply troubled\" by any incident that endangers its users, noting that safety is a top priority.",
      "\"Roblox is committed to empowering parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children.\"",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced in April that he issued a subpoena to Roblox.",
      "\"There are concerning reports that this gaming platform, which is popular among children, is exposing them to harmful content and bad actors,\" he said in a press release. \"We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing\u2014if any\u2014to avoid interactions with predators.\"",
      "Open-world games like Spray Paint!, where users can roam a virtual space in relative anonymity, can be a double-edged sword. Doris Chang, a psychologist and associate professor at New York University's Silver School of Social Work, says that these spaces can be affirming for queer youth.",
      "\"They can be whoever they want. Gender fluidity is really common,\" Chang said, adding it can also put those groups at risk for exposure to hate speech and predatory individuals.",
      "\"You're just interacting with people that you wouldn't normally interact with. It's completely wide open,\" Chang said.",
      "Chang said when children play a game like Spray Paint! without parental supervision, they may have to navigate problematic scenarios that might be confusing or upsetting.",
      "\"It brings up the larger question about how much parents know about what their kids are getting exposed to online,\" she said. \"Broadly speaking, Roblox is just one corner of the internet that our kids are navigating.\"",

    "title": "Why utility bills are rapidly rising in some states",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-utility-bills-are-rapidly-rising-in-some-states/",
    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 06:19:49 -0400",
    "summary": "Residential electricity rates are expected to increase by as much as 18% in the next few years, according to the Energy Information Administration.",
    "story": [
      "If you noticed your utility bill has gone up this summer, you're not alone. On average, electricity costs are 5.5% higher today than they were a year ago, according to the latest federal data, and natural gas is up 13.8%.",
      "Nearly 60 utility companies are set to increase electricity rates this year by more than $38 billion, affecting more than 57 million Americans, according to analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.",
      "President Trump recently commented on the rising prices, blaming them on renewable power. He wrote on Truth Social that renewables were \"THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!\" And he vowed he would not approve wind and solar projects.",
      "But higher rates are largely a result of higher demand, and that's being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating and electrified forms of transportation \u2014 all technologies that require immense amounts of power, according to Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C. based energy consultancy firm, \"When supply is scarce, then prices go up,\" he said.",
      "Gramlich says that after 25 years of a flat demand for energy and a dip during the pandemic, demand rose once economic activity picked up after the pandemic was over.",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also played a role in higher costs, disrupting international energy supply chains and causing rates to go up in the U.S. Rapid growth in data centers and newer electrified forms of technology mean the nation will need 15% more capacity \u2014 or 120 gigawatts \u2014 by the end of the decade to keep pace, Gramlich estimated.",
      "The increasing demand is a big reason why the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0expects residential electricity rates to increase steadily by as much as 18% in the next few years, far outstripping the annual inflation rate of about 2.7%.",
      "The fastest way to bring rates down would be to increase supply, but there are challenges.",
      "U.S. falling behind on transmission",
      "Gramlich, in recent testimony before Congress, said there's no shortage of fuel to add to the grid \u2014 it's a shortage of transmission that's the major problem.",
      "At the end of 2023, there were more than 2,600 gigawatts of energy waiting to get connected, representing over twice the current installed capacity of the U.S. power grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. And 95% of it was generated by solar, wind, and battery storage.",
      "To meet growing electricity needs, the U.S. needs to expand transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and even that may need to triple by 2050, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Energy.",
      "\"If we can get a lot of transmission built, then I think we can meet the AI-driven data center demands,\" Gramlich said.",
      "AI data centers consume far more power from the grid than regular data centers, says Norman Bashir, a fellow at MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium, where researchers are studying the impact of generative AI on the grid.",
      "\"AI data centers are much more power intensive,\" Bashir told CBS News Boston last month. \"So, if you have a normal data center, an AI data center would be up to 10 times more power intensive.\"",
      "Role of tariffs and equipment shortages",
      "Beyond the transmission backlog, Gramlich says tariffs and equipment shortages are making energy projects more expensive. One example \u2014 gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that's holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.",
      "\"The price of an actual turbine has almost tripled,\" Gramlich said. And the wait time for a gas turbine is around three or four years \u2014 even as long as seven, according to a May\u00a0 analysis by S&P Global.",
      "Energy sources",
      "Over the past decade, the nation's energy mix has increasingly grown to favor natural gas and renewables, like wind, solar and hydropower, that have become much cheaper to produce. New nuclear plants won't be on line before 2030, Gramlich said, and coal is becoming less economically viable because of maintenance and update costs required to address pollution concerns.",
      "\"That leaves wind and solar and battery storage that can help in this decade,\" Gramlich told CBS News.",
      "But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels. Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.",
      "\"If things keep going like this, [utility bills] are gonna be higher next year,\" Gramlich said.",
      "Trump energy policies projected to raise prices",
      "Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump issued a \"National Energy Emergency\" executive order, arguing the country needs \"reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation's manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.\"",
      "Most of the actions tied to that order have gutted renewable energy generation and are bolstering fossil fuel development.",
      "The passage of Trump's signature legislation, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to make energy more expensive, impact jobs, and make it more difficult to meet rising energy demand, according to analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.",
      "OBBBA will change the tax code, increasing generation costs, resulting in a drop in power generation capacity of 340 gigawatts by 2035, says Michael O'Boyle, acting policy team director of Energy Innovation in an email to CBS News. To put that in perspective, 1 gigawatt typically powers 750,000 homes, so 340 gigawatts could power about 255 million homes.",
      "O'Boyle estimates wholesale energy prices will increase by 74% by 2035, resulting in a $170 annual increase in the average household energy bill. Some 760,000 jobs could be lost by 2030, and the states that are expected to see the biggest impacts on energy cost increases and job losses from the OBBBA are South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina.",
      "The Energy Department criticized the analysis and its support of renewables arguing, \"The OBBBA ensures taxpayers will no longer be forced to subsidize intermittent energy sources like wind and solar \u2013 subsidies that have only resulted in more expensive, less reliable energy,\" said Ben Dietderich, the department's press secretary and chief spokesman, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Ending Biden-era clean energy policies",
      "Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects,\u00a0according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the president and Congress is making it harder for Americans to have access to the cheapest, cleanest, quickest to deploy power there is,\" said Bob Keefe, E2's executive director.",
      "\"By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,\" Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. Grumet cited EIA data and noted, \"The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.\"",
      "Trump admin. keeping fossil fuel generation alive",
      "To address rising energy demand, the Energy Department has ordered some utility companies to keep coal power plants open beyond their retirement dates, an action that could cost more than $3.1 billion a year by 2028, according to analysis by Gramlich's firm, Grid Strategies.",
      "\"These coal plants are basically uneconomic in the market. Each year, they incur tens of millions of dollars of maintenance just to stay operating,\" said Gramlich.",
      "Those costs to extend the life of coal plants will be borne by ratepayers, according to a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.",
      "Coal plants are generally planned for retirement when their operating cost exceeds their expected revenue or their value to the electric grid, the EIA\u00a0has pointed out. Coal-fired plants, which produce high levels of CO2 emissions, have been under pressure to be phased out in many states, in particular, those with clean energy goals. According to the EIA, natural gas and clean energy sources are providing a growing share of the nation's electricity, while coal has been waning. By the end of 2023, the maximum potential power plant output for coal was 15.2%, down from 45% in 1990.",
      "If additional fossil fuel-based plants delay retirement dates \u2014 28% were expected to be retired by 2035 \u2014 the bill to ratepayers could grow to more than $6 billion.",
      "Still, Energy Secretary Chris Wright supports the administration's efforts to keep fossil fuel generation online longer.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to continue down the unstable and dangerous path of energy subtraction previous leaders pursued, forcing the closure of baseload power sources like coal and natural gas,\" he said in a statement, upon releasing a report on the U.S. grid's reliability. \"If we are going to keep the lights on, win the AI race, and keep electricity prices from skyrocketing, the United States must unleash American energy.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 19:53:30 -0400",
    "summary": "These deliberate attacks on police can contribute to a drop in recruiting the next generation of law enforcement and holding onto current officers.",
    "story": [
      "When police officers responded to a disturbance call at a home in Tremonton, Utah, on Sunday, a man there immediately started shooting at them. Two officers were killed, a sheriff's deputy was wounded and a police dog was also hospitalized with injuries.",
      "It was an ambush.",
      "Mayor Lyle Holmgren said the suspect's \"intention was to cause harm to as many police officers and public servants as possible.\"",
      "The shooting was the latest in a growing trend of ambush attacks against police officers nationwide. Shootings against police have jumped 60% since 2018, \u00a0according to data tracked by the Fraternal Order of Police, a law enforcement member organization that's been tracking the shootings since 2015 \u2014 and the percentage of ambush-style attacks is steadily growing.",
      "At least 56 law enforcement officers have been shot in 45 ambush-style attacks in 2025 through July 31, more than 28% of total officers shot, according to data collected by the organization and analyzed by CBS News. Five years earlier, just over 20% of police officers shot in the line of duty were struck in ambush-style attacks.",
      "The Fraternal Order of Police's national president, Patrick Yoes, wrote a letter to Congress in March advocating for the \"Protect and Serve Act,\" which would create a new federal law against knowingly assaulting law enforcement. He said the deliberate attacks are contributing to a crisis in recruiting the next generation of officers and holding onto those who are currently serving.",
      "In July, after a week of violence in which 10 police officers were shot, three fatally, Yoes wrote: \"How many more officers must die before Congress acts? Our men and women in law enforcement deserve better.\"",
      "\"Send everyone\"",
      "Often, what seem like routine calls are the precursors to planned bloodshed, like what happened to police officers in Fargo, North Dakota, when they responded to a car accident on July 14, 2023.",
      "The call came in from dispatch: a BMW sport utility vehicle crashed into a Mazda on 25th Street in South Fargo, one of the city's busiest streets. Newly minted Fargo police officer Tyler Hawes and his training officer, Andrew Dotas, headed to the scene to assist and interview the drivers and passengers involved.",
      "Right away, Hawes, who graduated from the Fargo Police Academy seven weeks earlier, radioed dispatch for a second officer. He figured they could use some extra help speaking to witnesses and controlling traffic.",
      "Officers Zachary Robinson and Jake Wallin arrived in about 10 minutes. Hawes, who attended the police academy with Wallin, recalled his friend and colleague asking as soon as he got there, \"What do you need?\"",
      "Less than two minutes later they were ambushed.",
      "Wallin, 23, was killed, and Hawes and Dotas were injured when a man named Mohamad Barakat opened fire from his 2006 Mercury Grand Marquis in a surprise attack, using an Anderson manufacturing rifle with a Bushnell scope. One other person at the scene, Karlee Koswick, was wounded, shot twice on the sidewalk as she tried to flee.",
      "One witness, Kim Hauger Sr., heard what he said felt like the sound of a machine gun. Hauger told investigators he saw two police officers moving from the parking lot toward the boulevard, and then saw the officers fall to the ground.",
      "Robinson radioed dispatch, saying shots had been fired.",
      "\"Send everyone,\" he said, before opening fire on the suspect. \"I shot like four times at him at that point,\" he said, before reloading and killing Barakat.",
      "The suspect had nothing to do with the vehicle crash. Investigators later found Barakat had been searching online for details on mass shootings, loaded his vehicle with rifles, two tactical vests, thousands of rounds of ammunition and a live grenade.",
      "When he spotted the police officers, he decided to turn his deadly weapons on them \u2014 joining a steadily rising list of shooters who have deliberately ambushed law enforcement.",
      "An upward trend \u2014 and training to respond",
      "The FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services Division launched an investigative study in 2025 in response to the troubling trend. Federal agents have begun interviewing offenders in a first-of-its-kind effort to piece together what can be learned about the rise in attacks on law enforcement officers nationwide.",
      "Prior to the recent study, there has been scant research about ambush attacks against law enforcement and why these are happening.",
      "One earlier study from the International Association of Chiefs of Police found 68% of ambushes were considered spontaneous, like the 2023 Fargo ambush, and 32% were planned. The report, published in 2014, analyzed data from 1990 to 2012, a year when six law enforcement officers were killed in ambushes.",
      "According to the IACP, an ambush is defined by four components: an element of surprise, concealment of the assailant, suddenness of the attack, and a lack of provocation. Ambushes can be classified as either premeditated or spontaneous.",
      "The FBI released a report in 2018 showing ambush attacks on law enforcement doubled from 1996 to 2016. It found that while fewer police officers were being killed overall, surprise attacks in which officers are killed were steadily increasing. (The FBI's data counts officers killed in ambushes, while the FOP data counts all officers shot.)",
      "There was a large spike in ambush-style attacks in 2023, when 138 officers were shot.",
      "Texas has had more recent incidents than any other state; so far this year, eight officers there have been shot in seven ambush-style attacks. It's followed by California and Ohio, each with four ambush-style attacks.",
      "FBI law enforcement operations specialist Kevin Harris has been researching ambush attacks for several years, and he trains police around the country on how to prepare and respond.",
      "\"Just speaking in general, it's been an upward trend that seems to just continue upward and has been for the last several years,\" said Harris, who describes an ambush as an instance \"where an officer is lured into a place where they can be attacked.\"",
      "His training sessions involve analyzing and discussing different ambush attacks that have occurred in recent years. Harris said he wants officers to know \"they've always got to have that situational awareness.\"",
      "\"I try to tell officers, 'Look, you've got to find that fine line between being hypervigilant and dying of a heart attack at a young age,'\" Harris said.",
      "Lives changed forever",
      "The trauma of these attacks ripples through families, police departments and communities around the country.",
      "\"Those lives are impacted forever,\" said Harris.",
      "Two years have passed since the Fargo attack and the officers who survived can now speak about what happened to them that day.",
      "Officers Dotas and Hawes spent weeks in the hospital.\u00a0 Hospital staff, family, friends and other officers gathered to applaud as Dotas, wearing a \"We are Fargo PD\" sweatshirt, finally left the facility with his wife and young son, AJ, by his side.",
      "Dotas, who said he joined the police force because he wanted to live \"a meaningful life,\" told CBS News about some of the challenges he faced during his long road to recovery.",
      "\"I didn't really get a chance to be a protector anymore. I had to rely on, like, on everyone else to protect me,\" he said.",
      "He credits his faith and his family for pulling him through. He also said, looking back on that fateful day, \"There was a lot of miracles that took place that day.\" Dotas said the medics already being at the scene for the vehicle crash when the shooting happened probably helped save their lives.",
      "Hawes said in an interview released by Fargo police that they were lucky there were two trauma rooms open and two fully staffed medical teams ready to help.",
      "\"This event affected everyone that lives here,\" said trauma surgeon Dr. Enej Gasevic, who cared for the officers in a statement. He said it feels like the incident took away some of the innocence of living in the area.",

      "President Trump said that Intel has agreed to give the U.S. government a 10% stake in its business.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Mr. Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\"I said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He agreed, and they've agreed to do it.\"",
      "In a social media post Friday afternoon, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that the deal had been finalized, but did not elaborate.",
      "\"The United States of America now owns 10% of Intel, one of our great American technology companies,\" Lutnick wrote. \"This historic agreement strengthens U.S. leadership in semiconductors, which will both grow our economy and help secure America's technological edge.\"",
      "Lutnick also thanked Tan \"for striking a deal that's fair to Intel and fair to the American People.\"",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "What federal grants does Intel receive?",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn't been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program.",

      "Keith Lambert and his family cope with the extreme heat of summertime Chicago by going in and out of their house as quickly as possible and making sure their insulated shades are always drawn.",
      "\"It's really just minimizing the exposure,\" Lambert said. \"Its about doing your best to manage your cooling touch points.\"",
      "Lambert is like tens of millions of Americans navigating major heat waves, with temperatures consistently exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit. More often than not, the heat hits hardest for people of color and low-income residents, although Lambert and his family consider themselves middle class.",
      "\"The reality is there is a financial tie as to your comfort level and your well-being when it comes to extreme heat conditions,\" Lambert said. \"If you don't have the means and/or effort to cool, you have three choices: you bake, you're suffering and dealing with it, or do the best to go out and find places that have air conditioning.\"",
      "Mortality records from cities across the country have shown that heat kills along socioeconomic and racial lines. A recent study from Caltech found residents of low-income neighborhoods are bearing the brunt of the hotter temperatures.",
      "Environmental justice advocates trace this inequality back to decades of discriminatory housing policy, especially redlining \u2014 the 1930s government practice of rating neighborhoods' investment worthiness using race as a determining factor and denying mortgages to minority buyers.",
      "\"The redlining and all of the historic environmental injustices that happens to black and brown communities in this country are now coming to a head because its impacting everyone,\" said Alicia White, founder of Project Petals an environmental nonprofit that serves Black and brown communities.",
      "\"It's impacting our communities the most,\" White said.",
      "Extreme heat prompts need for green spaces",
      "The extreme heat isn't just uncomfortable; it's the\u00a0top cause of weather-related fatalities nationwide. According to\u00a0a New York City mortality report, extreme heat kills an average of 350 New Yorkers each year. While heat waves are \"incredibly deadly,\" according to Eric Klinenberg, a sociology professor at New York University, they are also \"largely ignored.\" Heat is invisible and makes for less spectacular imagery than hurricanes or floods.",
      "\"But also the people heat waves affect are often made invisible in our public life,\" said Klinenberg, the author of \"Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.\" \"They're disproportionately poor, Black and elderly. They often live in segregated neighborhoods.\"",
      "Environmentalists say one solution to beating the heat in sprawling cities is planting more trees, creating green spaces like parks and meadows and covering rooftops with plants.",
      "In Arizona, the nonprofit Unlimited Potential, which focuses on promoting health and wellness, maintains a program to develop the urban forestry workforce to grow and maintain the tree canopy in Phoenix.",
      "Tawsha Trahan, director of healthy communities at Unlimited Potential, said growing the tree canopy in Phoenix, especially in low-income neighborhoods is needed as the lack of trees contribute to their hotter temperatures.",
      "\"(There) are many reasons that contribute to having hotter neighborhoods but one of those reasons is they simply have much less trees,\" Trahan said. \"It's visual. You can drive around in a neighborhood and see a substantial difference with the tree canopy cover.\"",
      "Last fall, the New York City Council passed laws\u00a0adding trees\u00a0to the city charter's sustainability plans and\u00a0requiring the city to develop an urban forest plan\u00a0to increase tree cover from 22-30% by 2035. Still many predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods do not have green spaces within a five mile radius.",
      "White, the Project Petals founder, said her organization is working to change that by providing the communities with resources they need to create green spaces, such as community gardens. Since 2015, Project Petals has helped open 10 green spaces, ranging from a quarter of an acre to five acres.",
      "\"These spaces really help to filter our air and they lower our temperature,\" White said.",
      "But these spaces, like one in the Jamaica section of Queens with its abundant greenery, aren't just an area to cool down or find shade. They are a place where community can grow. White said you can often find residents and volunteers sitting down for conversation, finding a quiet space to read a book, studying for school and growing their own food.",
      "\"In a place like New York, we are called the concrete jungle, (some) people don't have access to green spaces at all,\" White said.",
      "Green spaces are also beneficial for\u00a0children in school. An estimated 28 million kids in the U.S. don't have easy access to parks or green spaces, according to Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit.",
      "Blacktops\u00a0absorb and trap heat, and can reach up to 145 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "Ways heat data helps cities cope",
      "With increasing temperatures and development patterns, experts say its only going to get hotter, unless something is done. Some are using data as a way to alert communities to the growing dangers.",
      "For example, Kevin Lanza, an assistant professor of environmental sciences at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health in Austin, is helping cities mitigate heat exposure at bus stops. Because Texas's communities of color rely heavily on public transportation systems, this increases their exposure to heat, Lanza said.",
      "In 2019, Lanza's study found that the hottest days saw lower bus ridership. But when the bus stops were shaded by trees, the area was twice as cool and prevented steep ridership lost. The findings prompted the Houston transit authority, METRO and other agencies to begin work to redesign their bus stops to provide relief from the heat, Lanza said.",
      "As of June, according to reporting from Houston Public Media, six shelters have been redesigned to allow more airflow, with more stops expected to be replaced over the next six months.",
      "In 2023, Cap Metro, the transit authority in Austin, also used Lanza's study to develop\u00a0a plan\u00a0to mitigate heat impacts by planting more tree across the city and near existing bus stops.",
      "How a climate dashboard helps communities",
      "Julia Silver, a lifelong resident of California, used to spend her summers with her family at an outdoor public pool. Now, amid record-breaking heat waves, Silver and her family have spent the majority of the summer inside their Los Angeles home, the local mall or other air-conditioned facilities.",
      "\"It's just kind of become unbearable during those hot summer days to spend time outside,\" said Silver, a researcher at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute.",
      "In June, Institute launched a\u00a0Latino Climate and Health Dashboard, which creates a centralized source that shows the climate disparities Latino neighborhoods across California. Developed with guidance from a statewide advisory committee of climate justice, public health, and data equity experts, the dashboard shows 90% of California's Latino population faces climate inequities, from higher air pollution to more days of extreme heat than white residents.",
      "\"The disparities shown in the dashboard are not random,\" said Silver, a senior research analyst at the LLPI and the project's leader.",
      "Silver said the main purpose of the dashboard is to ensure local leaders, community groups, government agencies and others have access to trustworthy data that reflects the experience communities in California and so many other states are facing.",
      "\"The more climate change intensifies the more difficult it is for people to live, and the more dangerous it is for people to be outside,\" Silver said.",
      "The dashboard will help create a shift to more inclusive climate planning by helping organizations understand who is most affected and where the greatest needs are.",
      "\"By shining a light on these patterns, we can start correcting them,\" said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, research faculty director at LPPI and principal investigator for the project.",

    "summary": "Energy suppliers are having trouble keeping up with the rapid increase in demand, and consumers in some states are seeing higher monthly bills.",
    "story": [
      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",

      "In Jabaliya, the densely populated refugee camp just north of Gaza City, residents said they endured heavy explosions overnight.

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Rep. Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We go now to Republican Congressman Mike Lawler of New York. Good to have you here, Congressman, there's a lot to get to with you, but I want to pick up on something we were discussing with the governor of Maryland, and that was this redistricting, gerrymandering that is happening. The President encouraged Texas Republicans to do it. Now, California Democrats are trying to get districts redrawn as well. Why do you so strongly oppose this?",
      "REP. MIKE LAWLER: I think gerrymandering is fundamentally wrong, and it is at the heart of why Congress has been broken for so many years. If you look three decades ago, there were over 100 competitive districts. Last November, only 35 seats were decided by five points or less, and mine wasn't even one of them, despite the fact that Kamala Harris won my seat, I won by six and a half points. So when you look at the map across the country, the fact is roughly 400 members are not in competitive districts. They're focused primarily on primaries and not general elections, and therefore they're not focused on appealing to a much broader swath of the electorate. And I think that obviously reflects itself when you're actually trying to negotiate legislation and beyond. But when you look at the redistricting situation, obviously both parties do not have clean hands here. Democrats in New York did mid-decade redistricting last year in 2024 at the behest of Hakeem Jeffries, who wanted to pick up seats in New York to become Speaker. They gerrymandered the maps after stacking the court and getting a favorable ruling ordering a mid-decade redistricting, despite the fact that they gerrymandered maps in 2022 and those were thrown out because it violated the state constitution. So now New York is going for a third bite at the apple, according to Governor Hochul, who has made it clear since the moment she took office in 2021 that she would use redistricting to help Democrats win the house. So this is what you're dealing with, red states and blue states trying to get electoral advantage right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I guess what's different now is the President's direct involvement in this, which is why it's interesting you have legislation to try to oppose some of this. Do you really think you can get that done if the President of United States doesn't want it done?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Look, obviously, it's going to be a fight, but this is something that I fundamentally believe we need to reform. We need to ban gerrymandering nationwide. We need to ban mid decade redistricting. I want to include term limits as part of those reforms, because I fundamentally believe when you have members of Congress like Chuck Schumer, who's been in elected office since 1974 never held a job outside of elected office. It's time to go. You need term limits. You need overall reform. So I'm going to fight tooth and nail to get this done. Obviously, you know there's going to be strong headwinds from both parties, because frankly, I don't think both parties are interested in reforming the way Congress functions.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, they want the majority. Period. On the question, though, that we have been- also been discussing with the governor, that is crime. The President of the United States has mentioned New York is another city he wants to look at to deploy National Guard troops. Do you think that's the best use of federal taxpayer dollars, and are you comfortable with that happening in your state?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Crime has been a major problem in New York for years, and Kathy Hochul and Albany and New York City Democrats have failed miserably to tackle this crime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Do you want National Guard troops?-- ,",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- By the way, Kathy Hochul has mobilized- Kathy Hochul has mobilized National Guard's troops to go into the subway system because of the crime in the subway system. So that has been done, obviously, for the purpose of surging resources and trying to prevent crime. When you look at the fact that in New York City, for instance, 80% of gun crimes do not result in a conviction or prosecution, that 80% of these individuals are released back out onto the street despite using guns in the commission of a crime. You look at Washington DC, 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. So when Democrats talk about gun violence, how come they don't want to actually prosecute and enforce the law against criminals who are using guns in the commission of a crime?",
      "[START CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- No, but that's a local--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- This is a fundamental problem and it's why the homicide rate--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- that's a local issue that would need to get changed. But in terms of the question on the troops--",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- No but- it's- no- but Margaret, this why the homicide rate is so high--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You'd rather troops than FBI agents or ATF agents or DEA agents. You don't want federal agents who are trained law enforcement officers in New York City. You would rather National Guardsmen --",
      "REP. LAWLER: -- I want- I want all of the above.--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- who have trained to be trained to police?",
      "[END CROSSTALK]",
      "REP. LAWLER: No. No, no, don't put words in my mouth. I'd rather all of the above, the FBI, the DEA, ATF. I've met with ATF just a few weeks ago in my office on this very issue of really cracking down on gun crimes and prosecuting criminals who use guns in the commission of a crime. I was proud last year to lead the passage of the Undetectable Firearms Act, a common sense, bipartisan piece of gun safety legislation enacted into law in the 1980s. We extended it seven years to make sure that no gun is manufactured or sold with less than 3.7 ounces of metal. I led that effort, and the reason I did is because we do not want guns on the street being used in the commission of a crime, and yet, as I pointed out, you look at Washington D.C., only 1.7% of gun crime convictions result in jail time. This is why you've seen the homicide rate double in less than a decade. It's outrageous, and it's exactly why the President is cracking down on crime in major cities, and as we saw in California, he is legally authorized to do so.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something in New York State that matters. A good amount of money from that CHIPs bill went to New York. On Friday, the White House announced there's going to be a change to how the government deals with that money that's meant to make America independent of Asian computer chip manufacturing and bring it all back on shore, the President wants to buy a 10% stake in Intel. That company says it's going to now basically have US taxpayers as a shareholder, own 10%. As a conservative, do you think that the government should have ownership stakes in private companies?",
      "REP. LAWLER: Generally speaking, no, I think when you look at prior history, when we've had, for instance, the bank bailouts, when we've had the auto bailouts, you know, in the- in the aftermath of the collapse of the market and '08 the American taxpayer really didn't get a return on that. I think what the President is seemingly trying to do is get a return on these tens of billions of dollars that are being invested by U.S. taxpayers, by U.S. taxpayers into companies like Intel to manufacture chips. And so rather than just give the money away, get a return on that investment. Obviously, this is a national security issue. We want to be in control of the manufacturing of semiconductors and that's critical for our foreign policy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, I'm sorry to cut you off. I'm being told I have to go to a commercial break, so I'm going to leave it there. We'll be right back."

      "SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN: Good morning, or, afternoon here.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, exactly. You do sit on the Armed Services Committee as well. Here in Washington, there was a sudden round of firings we learned of on Friday. There was Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. He was dismissed, the Pentagon did not explain why. In addition, the Navy Reserve chief, Vice Admiral Nancy Lacore, was fired. The Navy SEAL who oversees Naval Special Warfare Command, Rear Admiral Milton Sands, was dismissed. Has Congress been informed as to why these leaders are being fired by Secretary Hegseth?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I'm not aware that Congress has been informed about any of these firings, and they come on the heels of firings earlier this year, of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the head of Naval Operations, Admiral Franchetti, and a series of other military leaders. And it's unfortunate, because one of the things, one of the strengths of America's military, are the professional military leaders who have come up through the ranks, who have the training, the expertise, to be able to do the jobs. And what we don't want is political people in those jobs, who are not going to give honest assessments of the military situation wherever we happen to be. So it's very troubling.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I believe our feed there just froze, and we're going to try to get that back up, if we can. The Senator is joining us from Amman, Jordan. So I'm going to take a break while we reestablish that connection.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: The feed just froze.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're back now with Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who joins us remote from Amman, Jordan. We- we lost you there, but we're so glad you're back with us now, Senator. Let me ask you about why you are in the Middle East right now. We heard on Friday, this internationally recognized body, backed by the UN, the IPC. It tracks hunger. And they confirmed, technically confirmed, there is a man-made famine underway in Gaza. This is a very rare designation, only four other times has one been designated. The country you are in, Jordan, called it a \"shameful failure of humanity\" that Israel is starving Palestinians with impunity, called it a war crime. Would you say that that three month blockade by Israel of Gaza is a war crime?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think is- it is a shameful black mark on humanity that the world has allowed this to happen and that Israel is allowing this to happen. One of the- we had a very good meeting today with King Abdullah of Jordan, and one of the places that we visited is the Jordan humanitarian assistance program that is trying to get aid into Gaza. This is an- it funded trucks and warehouses and food that the United States has contributed to as part of this administration. They are trying to get in 150 trucks a day into Israel. And Israel has prevented those trucks from going in in a way that would provide the nutrition that Gazans need to prevent starvation. It is unacceptable. Prime Minister Netanyahu is the point at which obstruction is happening. He needs to look at what he's doing and change his position.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The Israeli Prime Minister's Office on Friday had a very harsh statement about the famine designation. They called it, quote, \"a modern blood libel, spreading like wildfire through prejudice.\" That suggests this is about anti-Jewish hate rather than starvation. How do you make sense of the Israeli defense?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think that's a good defense. The fact is, this is not about antisemitism, which I abhor, and the United States' position is against antisemitism, and we need to do everything we can to prevent it. But the reality is, we have people dying because they are systematically being starved to death, because Israel is refusing to allow in the humanitarian aid that people need to keep alive. Not only that, they're getting ready to do another- or, they've already started, planning another major incursion into Gaza in ways that are going to kill more people. So this is not acceptable. The world needs to speak out. I think it's very important that we allow that humanitarian aid in, to the people who are starving.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I- I understand your criticism right now. I want to ask you a little bit though about standing U.S. policy, because this has been a problem even during the Biden administration. In fact, former deputy national security adviser for President Biden Joe- Jon Finer, just wrote a piece in the Atlantic, and he said that while he stands by the decision to embrace Israel after October 7, he believes \"we did far too little, far too late to limit the truly catastrophic civilian harm that Israel's response inflicted.\" Do you agree with him, and do you wish that you spoke out more forcefully sooner?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I don't think this is a partisan position. With me on this journey to Jordan is Congressman Joe Wilson from South Carolina. He agreed with me that we need to make sure those humanitarian aid trucks get into Israel. We need to do everything possible to ensure that Prime Minister Netanyahu is stopping the roadblocks that are preventing the humanitarian aid from getting in. I think it's something that, I hope, that both Democrats and Republicans can embrace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But- but do you agree with this self criticism by this key Democrat? Do you think Democrats should have said more sooner--",
      "(BEGIN CROSSTALK)",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We should be doing more and we should have done more. Absolutely.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I want to also ask you--",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: I think everybody--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Go ahead.",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: --should have said more sooner, not just Democrats, but Republicans.",
      "(END CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why are you now?",
      "SEN. SHAHEEN: We had the opportunity to be here today to meet with those Jordanians who are working very hard to try and get humanitarian aid into Gaza, who are being stymied in that effort by bureaucratic obstacles that make no sense. When it takes hours to scan a truck, which could be done in two to three, and it diverts the aid when it's costing hundreds of dollars per truck, and they turn those trucks away, and when they come back the next day, it costs another hundreds of dollars more for the same truck, when they find an excuse for why it gets stopped at the border. That's- that's not a legitimate effort to get humanitarian aid in to the people of Gaza who are starving. And that can be changed. All it takes is Prime Minister Netanyahu saying, we're going to allow that aid in.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senators Jeanne Shaheen joining us from Amman, Jordan. Bit of a delay there. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday about a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing man-made famine, and that those conditions will expand soon. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment. Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us. We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation- so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real-world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, thank you, Margaret. Let me say this: You know, it's been, now, almost two years since October 7th, and since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage, and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for months and months and months, which is a terrible famine. You know, we've estimated at this point that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who die from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying we beware, right, this- this famine is just right around the corner, and it's- it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know. It's so- it's shocking that it's happened, because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising. And what it means, really, is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image. Children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where you know suddenly they're all quiet. The children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry, and to see that happen, and especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid in to these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the UN data is flawed. The Prime Minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice. Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot- journalists who live inside Gaza, because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know that what you're saying is fact?",
      "RUSSELL: Let me say two things about that. One is the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people, and they monitor this as they go, and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-related deaths, so it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate. I would also say it- to me, it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, right? I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not? First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean, we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming, you should be it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absent that, we're going to have to rely on the data that we have the people who were there, and I can tell you, from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean, I have spoken to our staff, and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived, many thousands of children who have had amputations, and are, you know, it's just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just- almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussion, stop arguing, and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children, make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a distant future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out. On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people: The former US Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, and another Mid-East Envoy have said the UN agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why- why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, I- the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, the UN had 400 places where we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, okay? And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food, people are getting shot. It's a terrible situation, and it doesn't work. It's not working that well. Now look, I don't- I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our let us do our work, too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say we, it's not just UNICEF, it's the UN, it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that it gets to the people who need it. And I, you know, do both. I'm fine with that, but at least make sure that humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly, and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that nobody wants that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did indeed. I want to ask you, as well, about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good, and we need them to step up and do more. Sudan, as you say, is the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of Cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean, it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the US really can make a much bigger difference if they try to do this work, and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here? When you don't look --",
      "RUSSELL: Oh, it's horrible. First of all, they're not getting food. They're facing horrible sexual violence. I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart, and it's devastating, and the results, as you say, will last for generations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for sharing that. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside DC police forces. And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future? Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned is needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore, and joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore. Thank you for being here.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're here in DC- there are guardsmen from six different states on the street. The mission is, quote, 'beautification, duty and support.' The defense secretary has author- authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of DC. Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Well, there's- there's plenty of reasons. You know one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their national guards to Washington, DC. So who's going to- who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment, and for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big government approach in the way they're conducting public safety. The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful. And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the President's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans- is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by Federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received. When- when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need- where you need a surge of supports for- for traumas and disasters that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this, and this is a direct deflection that the President is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the President watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing because he's tweeting about you- or truthing, I guess. He says the Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a 'nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him,' and he's talking about 'crime ridden Baltimore.' It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime. He says it's a 'bad one.' He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby DC. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it. Is the reality here is- you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOV. MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day, and I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation. So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local- with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history. Over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOV. MOORE: No that came from both federal and state money, and also Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. Attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges. And the results have been- have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20% since I have been the governor, and the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet. And so the reason that I've asked the President to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance. This- these tropes, in these 1980s scare- scare tactics. And you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called 'We Our Us' who is a violence intervention group. And they say we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel. Because while the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime, but it's falling on deaf ears of the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The President's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore is the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis. Fourth highest murder rate. To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the Governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis--",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0--And we know we have work to do. We know- if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your- the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help-- he doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though, he says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF, do you need more federal help in policing if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the President to stop cutting funding. Because if you look at the President's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore. That it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons. Those are actually real, tangible things that the President of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is- President Trump says so as well, possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He spent a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I've been on his mind a lot of times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020 when the you know idea was defund the police.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. And yet the President spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in, and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected. And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore, because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father? And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the President of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work and we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not 'presidential timber' at all. I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah, I've been very clear. I'm not running for president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it's interesting that- but it's interesting the President seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people, and that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland. Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you brought up immigration one of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S. This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOV. MOORE: And the- what we know is that- you know, and all we're asking for, is that the constitution be followed on this. The constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues, and when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the President manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the President is using to just- working to exploit the brokenness. And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process. I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the Secretary of Homeland Security who is trying to be judge, Juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case. I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting or gerrymandering, as some people know it. You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one- one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah. When I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah because and I think- and I think we have to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes, and I think- and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the President of the United States very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes. We're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different, but Democrats redistrict you know this, Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where- where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps. And we also need to make sure that if the President of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections, because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent- they have a Republican representative that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think if you look at maps across the country, less than 10% of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature. Less than 10%. And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30% so that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we saw the Federal Reserve chair signal on Friday that the Fed is going to, as expected, begin lowering rates very soon, but he's also cited slowing economic growth and a cooling job market. So why then did the financial markets rally?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Because he finally pivoted to the risk that matters most for the U.S. economy right now. By construct the Fed has to deliver two things, maximum employment and price stability, and the Fed is looking at slightly higher inflation and a weakening labor market. And what Powell finally did, and many of us feel he should have done this earlier, is he said the risk to the employment side is higher than the risk to the inflation side, and therefore an interest rate cut is warranted. As you know, many of us felt he should have cut last month.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the Fed chair said significantly higher tariffs are remaking the entire global trade system. Tighter immigration policy has slowed labor growth, and there are big tax and regulation changes you can't quite, you know, quantify at this point, but it's a lot of uncertainty. Since economists have to build off of models and data, how do you predict where we're going if, basically, he's saying throw out your models?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So one of the problems is he hasn't looked forward enough. He's been very data dependent, and therefore he has tended to be late. Look, there is something promising in our future, and that is productivity enhancement that comes from exciting innovation in AI in life sciences and robotics and other areas. We just have to manage a challenging few months in the period ahead. And if that challenge is mishandled, we will not be able to get the opportunities that we have that offset a lot of structural headwinds, and that includes high debt and high deficits.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something we were discussing with Congressman Lawe- Lawler just before you, and that is this unusual decision for the U.S. government to take a stake in chip maker Intel. That company has been struggling of late and its CEO was criticized by the president United States. He was criticized by the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Tom Cotton. President Trump mentioned all of that on Friday, and he said this.",

      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP:",
      "He walked in wanting to keep his job and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States. So we picked up $10 billion. And we do a lot of deals like that.",
      "[SOUND ON TAPE ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president said the CEO wanted to keep his job, so he offered a 10% stake in his company. Is this signaling a new era for U.S. policy? I mean, central planning of the economy?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: I don't think so, Margaret. Look, as the congressman said, it's good to send the message that companies will not get something for nothing, and that is what they've gotten used to since 2008, all the bailouts. And what they are saying now--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Which were paid back--",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Which were paid back, but at the time, the government took enormous risk in many, many areas. The most important distinction, if I may, here, is between ownership and control. Yes, the government can own 10% but it must not control how this company manages its affair, because once we go down that road that is a really dangerous road, and that would eat away at what makes America really special, which is a dynamic, entrepreneurial economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I believe the Commerce Secretary said there won't be control, but that is something to watch for. I want to also ask you about political pressure, not just on the Federal Reserve Chair, which you've nodded to, but the President is also now threatening to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook. They're accusing her without publicly disclosed evidence of mortgage fraud and urging an investigation. In fact, the Justice Department wrote a letter to Chair Powell, encouraging her to be removed. Are you concerned that this is starting to be a pattern here of political interference with the Federal Reserve?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: So these allegations are unproven, and it's important to stress that. Having just said that, this is the fifth time in the last five years that there has been allegations against a Fed official. And already four of them have had to resign. So what I'm concerned about is that there seems to have been a culture that has developed at the Fed that has resulted in these four resignations. But I am very worried about preserving Fed independence. And an independent central bank is critical to the well being of the economy, and there's lots of reasons for that. So you know, one has to disting- distinguish between the two. I can't speak to the unproven allegations, but I do think it's really important to defend the central bank independence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, as I understand it, the governor has said she wants to, you know, share information, and is denying wrongdoing here. But just the fact that it is the President directing the attention towards her doesn't this suggest that even if Jerome Powell steps aside as head of the Federal Reserve, that this isn't going to stop this big spotlight on the central bank that is so powerful, and that the fear you have of political interference may not go away?",
      "MOHAMED EL-ERIAN: Yes, and I- my fear and my concern is that the longer Chair Powell is in his position, and it runs out in May, the longer he's in his position until then, the more this acts as a magnet for attacking, not only deeper attacks from the president, but much broader from the political system. And that's one thing that quite a few people are worried about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mohamed El-Erian, thank you so much for sharing your insight today. We'll leave it there. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The famine determination by the world's leading authority on food crises galvanized governments and aid groups to intensify pleas for Israel to halt its 22-month offensive on Gaza, prompted by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. Aid groups have warned for months that the war and Israel's restrictions of food into Gaza are causing starvation among civilians.",

      "Netanyahu said Thursday he had instructed officials to begin immediate negotiations to release hostages and end the war on Israel's terms. It is unclear if Israel will return to long-running talks mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar after Hamas said earlier this week that it accepted a new proposal from the Arab mediators.",
      "Hamas has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.",

      "Billy, 76, announced that he had been diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) \u2013 which affects his vision, hearing and balance \u2013 on social media in May.",
      "The \"Riverside Way\" singer, who is the daughter of Billy and his ex-wife, supermodel Christie Brinkley, 71, told Fox News Digital that her father has been \"incredibly resilient\" in the face of his health struggles.",
      "\"Unfortunately, I didn't get this characteristic from him because I like to express how I'm feeling always,\" Alexa, 39, said. \"He doesn't whine, especially in his older age.\"",

      "\"He's so cool about everything,\" Alexa added. \"He's always playing everything down, 'Oh, I'm fine. Don't worry.' He doesn't want me to worry, and he's just cool as a cat about everything. And I ask him, 'I'm like, how are you feeling? Are you OK?'\"",
      "Alexa, who just released her new single, explained that Billy is fully committed to his health and described how he has made some major lifestyle changes.",
      "In May, the legendary singer announced that he had been diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH).\u00a0 (Myrna Suarez)",
      "\"He's doing his physical therapy three to five days a week, which is really, really important for him right now,\" she said. \"He's adjusted his diet. We had dinner the other night. I said, 'Dad, what are you doing? You're not getting the steak? You're getting chicken instead?' Like, this is a whole new you here.\"",
      "\"He's suddenly eating eggplant and all sorts of vegetables. I said, 'Dad, you used to hate eggplant. He's like, 'Oh, I've learned to love it,'\" Alexa continued with a laugh.",
      "\"So I'm really proud of him and how he sort of adjusted his habits, and he's really at probably his most healthy actually right now in terms of how well he's taking care of himself and prioritizing his health,\" she added. \"Of course, as his eldest daughter, I'm always looking out for him and making sure he stays on the ball with that. So he's doing great.\"",
      "When Billy first revealed his NPH diagnosis, the five-time Grammy Award winner said that the condition had been \"exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"",
      "The statement at the time continued, \"Under his doctor\u2019s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.\"",

      "Bill Joel was \"advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.\" (Myrna Suarez)",
      "NPH is a condition that happens when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside the skull and presses on the brain. This condition is most likely to occur in people over age 65. Treating this condition involves surgery to implant a shunt to drain excess fluid from the inside of the skull, according to the Cleveland Clinic.",
      "Common symptoms of NPH include difficulty walking, urinary incontinence and problems with concentration and memory.",
      "However, Alexa told Fox News Digital that she had not noticed any change in Billy's cognitive abilities.",
      "\"It's funny because people were concerned about cognitive decline,\" she said. \"I don't see any of that from him. I really, really don't.\"",
      "\"I was doing a segment for SiriusXM for his channel, the Billy Joel channel on Sirius a couple of weeks ago,\" she said. \"I do a playlist of his songs. I do analysis on it with the backstories. So I interview him. I go straight to the source, my dad, and I ask him about all the material. And I was asking him, single by single, I said, \u2018Well, which album is this from? What year?\u2019\"",
      "\"He remembers every album, the exact year, the order in which the singles were ordered on the album,\" she added. \"So, as far as I'm concerned, he's sharp as a tack. I said, 'Oh my God, dad, I can't believe you remember the year of every single song and what was going on and where you were living.\"",
      "\"And I'm very thankful to have inherited this great memory because I've kind of got a memory like a steel vault. I don't forget anything myself.\"",
      "Billy shares Alexa with his ex-wife Christie Brinkley.\u00a0 (\u00a0Myrna M. Suarez/Getty Images)",
      "Alexa also followed in her father's footsteps and embarked on a career in the music industry. She first began composing songs at the age of 15 and debuted her six-song EP \"Sketches\" in August 2006.",
      "The singer-songwriter has also released a number of singles over the years, and she has previously performed with her father at charitable benefits and political fundraisers. In 2024, Alexa sang alongside her father in the final year of his Madison Square Garden residency.",
      "Alexa recently released her new song \"Riverside Way,\" which is the first single from her upcoming five-song EP.",
      "While speaking with Fox News Digital, Alexa explained how she is taking her music and lyrics in a bold new direction with \"Riverside Way.\"",
      "Alexa recently released her new single \"Riverside Way.\" (Alexa Ray Joel)",
      "\"It is personal to me because it was my way of saying to the world and saying, as an artist, I'm not just one person,\" she said. \"I think there is a sort of societal penchant and interest in putting women in a box and pinpointing them as, 'OK, she's that type.'\"",
      "Alexa continued, \"She's good or she is bad or she's sugar or she's spice or she's sweet or she's a bitch. We have this interest in pigeonholing women a lot of times. Or even people do it [and] they don't even realize, right? You just form quick judgments based on a picture or based on an interview clip, now with sound bites on social media. It's so easy to form judgments too quickly, I feel.\"",
      "\"And so \u2018Riverside Way\u2019 is personal for me because it's my way of saying, 'Hey, you know, just like most women and particularly artists, there's not just one side to us,'\" she added. \"There is the side of me that's very much the good daughter and loves to perhaps be a little more demure. But then there's another side that's...a bit wilder and more curious and more interested in exploring things. And I think with \u2018Riverside Way,\u2019 I wanted to show, it's OK to get outside your comfort zone and take risks, both with storytelling, narrative wise and stylistically with this song.\"",
      "\"I wanted this image of a girl that's just having a fantasy with a guy and, you know, speeding down the highway in a truck at 200 miles per hour, and they're not even sure where they're going or where they'll end up because they're so immersed in the moment. And so I wanted that escapism to be very vivid. And I am an escapist at heart. I love painting a very vivid picture in my mind. That I can just sort of climb into and crawl into. I get a real thrill from that as an artist.\"",

      "\"They both love me so much, too. I mean that's a huge part of it,\" she said. \"And there was a ton of love between them. Dare I say that I think a piece of that is still there. I mean they had a beautiful, beautiful love.\"",

      "\"I think just for people watching it in the documentary, the love was palpable,\" she said. \"And it was a lot of joy. I even thought it was the most uplifting part of the documentary, quite frankly, because they played off each other's differences, too.\"",
      "\"Mom smiling at the camera and dad pretending to say, \u2018Oh, get away.\u2019 They were always putting on skits and doing little schticks together. And having a lot of fun and just having a blast, I don't think, you know, I've never seen either of them as playful since those times.\"",
      "\"It was very emotional for me looking back, going, \u2018Wow, they look so carefree,\u2019\" she added. \"It's just so beautiful to see that. And I think they really opened each other up in that way. You know mom being the California girl who was just so full of life and so vivacious and so full of joy and radiance.\"",
      "\"And my dad was more like the Long Island hooligan, as he calls himself, but you know a genius with a chip on his shoulder,\" Alexa said with a laugh. \"So they kind of complimented each other in that way and their differences. And yet they had a lot in common that they both loved music and creativity and singing and dancing and putting on a show.\"",
      "\"They're both natural entertainers who are just perfect for showbiz in many ways. I know my dad acts like he's not, but he really is, at the end of the day, a genius at what he does. And they were able to find that connection, and then I was able to share that with them.\"",

      "Alexa explained that she would always treasure her memories of growing up with Billy and Brinkley while they were together.",

      "Democrats lost a staggering 47 House seats in 1966 \u2013 the first and only midterm of late President Lyndon Johnson. But the electoral rapture barely dented the robust House majority. Democrats controlled 295 House seats before the 1966 midterms, 248 seats afterwards. Still a comfortable margin.",
      "Very few political observers expected Democrats to lose control of the House in the legendary 1994 midterms \u2013 mainly because the party held the House for 40 consecutive years. It was nearly unthinkable that Democrats could lose the House \u2013 simply because it had not happened in decades. Democrats and other political observers excoriated the brilliant Michael Barone when he was the lone commentator to forecast that a Republican flip of the House could be in the offing come the fall of 1994.",
      "Barone was right, as Republicans collected 54 seats.",
      "Republicans nearly lost control of the House in the 1998 midterms \u2013 after they impeached former President Clinton. Republicans then bested the historic norms in 2002 and held the House, boosted by pro-GOP sentiment following 9/11.",

Democrats ran a number of moderate ex-military or \"national security\" Democrats \u2013 often in battleground districts. The relative unpopularity of President Donald Trump didn\u2019t help Republicans, either.",

Since President Trump is only the second commander in chief to return to office after a hiatus (late President Grover Cleveland was the first), 2026 serves as a de facto \"first midterm.\" Trump and the Republicans lost 41 House seats in 2018 \u2013 his true first midterm. But calculating what to expect next year is nearly impossible.",
      "Republicans now hold a 219 to 212 majority in the House with four vacancies. Three of those seats are solidly Democratic \u2013 for now. So for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say the breakdown is 220 to 215. Democrats must only flip a net of three seats to claim the majority.",

The Philadelphia Phillies are excellent \u2013 but just lost starting pitcher Zack Wheeler to a major injury. Who could surprise down the stretch? The Cincinnati Reds and Kansas City Royals are hardly out of it. Everyone understands the general variables of Major League Baseball as October nears.",
      "That is not the case with the 2026 midterms.",
      "Texas Republicans are now determined to redraw congressional districts to favor a GOP pickup of five seats. President Trump has endorsed similar efforts to tilt the field in favor of Republicans in GOP-strongholds like Missouri, Ohio and Indiana. California Gov. Gavin Newsom is threatening to upend the present maps in favor of Democrats in the Golden State. New York Democrats may try the same in the Empire State.",
      "So, we don\u2019t even know the basics. How far from the plate to the mound in the 2026 midterms? How large is the strike zone? Five balls for a walk or the standard four? Twelve players in the field or nine?",
      "Redistricting could also hamper Republicans \u2013 forcing the party to suddenly defend a number of more competitive seats. Democrats could suddenly have more opportunities where none existed in 2024.",

      "Maybe everything is status quo and Democrats only need to flip those three seats.",

Some conservatives doubt that the GOP has sufficiently sold the public on that legislation, especially during the August recess. Democrats are banking on the possibility that the legislation will backfire on the GOP in next year\u2019s midterms. We also don\u2019t know if President Trump not being on the ballot in 2026 is similar to the Republican midterm performance in 2018. It\u2019s clear that not having Mr. Trump on the ballot in 2018 undercut the party at the polls.",
      "Republicans could also face a backlash from moderates and swing voters if they are dissatisfied with the performance of the president. We certainly saw that after voters tired of the polices of former Presidents George H.W. Bush in 1990, Bill Clinton in 1994, George W. Bush in 2006 and Barack Obama in 2010.",
      "And, we have an entire 15 months before voters head to the polls next year. There could be another foreign policy crisis involving the Middle East. Tensions with Russia over Ukraine are volatile. There are a host of potential events \u2013 ranging from health policy to the economy \u2013 which could set the table for the midterms.",

      "Anti-woke crusader Robby Starbuck released a devastating video takedown of Cracker Barrel's leadership, making the case that the restaurant's logo and decor change are the culmination of a years-long campaign to cater to the far Left and abandon the values of its middle-America customer base.",
      "Starbuck, who has brought major companies including John Deere, Target, and Harley-Davidson to heel by exposing their woke policies, described Cracker Barrel\u2019s logo makeover as going from \"old American nostalgia\" to something \"cold, dead, lifeless and modern\" in a 15-minute video. He said that, while the Cracker Barrel brand is often associated with American tradition, the company is \"infested with left-wing activists who are more interested in safe spaces, pronouns and virtue signaling than they are in their customers.\"",

Rocking chairs are practically synonymous with Cracker Barrel, with the restaurant\u2019s long porches lined with them at locations nationwide.",
      "\"The fact that it's located there is important to this story because what's happened here is a microcosm of the parasitic operating procedure of left-wing activists,\" Starbuck said. \"They don't just wanna force their soulless, godless, hedonistic vision of the future onto blue hellscapes that their party controls.",
      "\"No, it's much more important to them that they shove it down into your towns, into your kids' schools and into your way of life. So, sticking a pro-trans rocking chair into their headquarters in a predominantly conservative town is exactly the type of thing they revel in doing.\"",
      "Starbuck then pointed to the company\u2019s involvement with HRC and participation in the Out and Equal Workplace Summit. For the Out and Equal conference, Cracker Barrel made rocking chairs in every color of the rainbow, representing the LGBTQ+ flag. Out and Equal even gave Cracker Barrel an award for having 2018\u2019s top LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group (ERG).",

    "story": [
      "Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on President Donald Trump's goal to put a nuclear reactor on the moon on 'Special Report.'",
      "A Harvard physicist who sounded the alarm earlier this month about a rare interstellar object passing through our solar system \u2014 suggesting it might be more than a comet \u2014 now says it could even be a nuclear-powered spaceship.",
      "The object, 3I/ATLAS, was first detected in early July by an Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. It marks only the third time an interstellar object has been observed entering our solar system, according to NASA.",
      "While NASA classified the object as a comet, Dr. Avi Loeb pointed out that an image showed an unexpected glow in front of the object rather than trailing behind it, something he called \"quite surprising.\"",

      "\"Alternatively, 3I/ATLAS could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy, and the dust emitted from its frontal surface might be from dirt that accumulated on its surface during its interstellar travel,\" Loeb wrote. \"This cannot be ruled out, but requires better evidence to be viable.\"",
      "Loeb dismissed other natural power sources. A primordial black hole, he said, would generate only about 20 nanowatts \u2014 far too weak. A radioactive fragment from a supernova was highly unlikely given its rarity, and frictional heating from interstellar gas and dust was ruled out by momentum and density constraints.",

      "A new report by The Wall Street Journal is warning people to think twice before trusting the 'unsubscribe' option at the bottom of promotional emails.",
      "Over the past year, more people have reported receiving order shipment emails for purchases they never made. These messages usually come from legitimate retailers, often sportswear brands or electronics stores, and contain real tracking numbers and delivery details. The products are being shipped to different names at different addresses, but for some reason, the buyer's contact email is yours.",
      "It might seem like a harmless clerical error or someone accidentally typing the wrong email address. But when it happens repeatedly, and across multiple unrelated orders, it starts to look less like a coincidence and more like a tactic.",

      "HOW TO DETECT FAKE AMAZON EMAILS AND AVOID IMPERSONATION SCAMS",

      "Some scammers use valid, active email addresses to bypass retailer fraud filters. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's likely happening with those shipment emails in your inbox",
      "It is unlikely that someone is accidentally typing your email address every single time. Rather, scammers are deliberately using valid, active email addresses like yours to bypass retailer fraud filters. Numerous sources confirm that fake order and shipping confirmation emails are a common tactic in fraud operations, with criminals exploiting the trust systems placed in legitimate email addresses.",
      "When a stolen credit card is used, pairing it with a real email that has not triggered spam alerts increases the chance the transaction will go unnoticed by anti-fraud systems. Retailers often check whether an email address is active or bounces. If the system sees a functioning address, it may be less suspicious than an obviously fake one.",
      "Once the order is placed, products are frequently sent to drop addresses or freight-forwarding services, as confirmed by official investigations into brushing scams. These services act as intermediaries, making the scam harder to trace. In that context, your email is simply a means to an end, a validated contact point that helps the operation move forward smoothly.",
      "Scammers can obtain email addresses when reputable companies experience data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How bad actors are able to get your email",
      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "Start by locking down your email account with a strong, unique password that you don\u2019t reuse anywhere else. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) so hackers can\u2019t get in even if they\u2019ve stolen your password.

Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "In your email settings (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), check for any connected apps, services or delegated access you don't recognize and remove them. This ensures no third party is piggybacking off your account.",
      "If this email misuse leads to fraudulent financial activity, users should file a report with the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov or their local authorities.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",
      "Synchron's advancement in BCI technology marks a significant step for assistive devices and hints at how we may interact with computers in the future. The device's hands-free, voice-free operation offers a powerful new level of accessibility and autonomy for people with disabilities.",

      "ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface (BCI) working with an iPad. (Synchron)",
      "A first for brain-tech and Apple",
      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "Mark Jackson operates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface, which functions using Apple's official protocol. (Synchron)",
      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought. That opens the door for more accessibility, more customization, and completely new ways of interacting with technology.",

      "Falls are the number one cause of injury among adults 65 and older. But the truth is, your risk doesn't suddenly appear the day you turn 65. It increases gradually over time, especially if you're dealing with weak muscles, balance issues, side effects from medication, or even just forgetting a pill. Experts recommend that everyone get screened for fall risk at age 65. But you don't have to wait for a doctor's visit to take action. A new wave of technology is giving older adults the power to track, prevent, and respond to fall risks, all from home. Here are 10 smart tools that can help.",

      "New technology can help track and prevent falls. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1) Gait sensors track how your balance changes over time",
      "Your walking pattern can reveal subtle issues that increase your risk of falling. If you use an iPhone with iOS 15 or newer, the built-in walking steadiness feature in the Health app can rate your balance as OK, low, or very low over time. Android users can use wearable fitness trackers like\u00a0Fitbit, or Samsung Galaxy Watch to gather similar data. These tools track stride, stability, and pressure patterns that help identify balance changes before you feel unsteady.",
      "FORGET 10,000 STEPS \u2014 RESEARCH REVEALS THE REAL NUMBER YOU NEED FOR BETTER HEALTH",
      "What to check:\u00a0On iPhone, open the Health app and review your walking steadiness trends. Android users can check their wearable app dashboards, like Samsung Health or Fitbit, to view step symmetry, cadence, and gait-related data. Look for any changes over weeks or months and take advantage of in-app exercise suggestions to improve balance and strength.",
      "Apps that track physical activity and walking patterns can help users improve their balance and strength, or even detect a change in gait before it becomes an issue. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "2) Smart pill dispensers prevent risky mistakes",
      "Forgetting to take medication, or taking too much, can cause grogginess or dizziness that increases fall risk. A smart pill dispenser helps make sure you take the right dose at the right time.",
      "What to look for: Look for dispensers with reminders, dose tracking, and alerts for missed meds.",
      "Smart pill dispensers can assist patients in making sure they take the correct dose of the desired medication at the right time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Fitness trackers keep you motivated to move",
      "Building strength, especially in your legs and core, is one of the best ways to prevent falls. Whether you use an\u00a0Apple Watch, Fitbit or another device, fitness trackers can nudge you toward daily movement goals.",
      "What to check:\u00a0Track your cardio fitness levels, not just step counts. It's a good indicator of your overall strength and endurance.",
      "Fitness tracking devices can help users build strength and resilience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Vital-sign monitors help detect lightheaded spells",
      "Dips in blood pressure or oxygen levels can make you feel woozy, which increases your fall risk.\u00a0Smartwatches and fingertip pulse oximeters help you monitor these changes in real time.",
      "What to check:\u00a0If you're not using a wearable, jot down your daily readings with a standard cuff or oximeter to spot any unusual trends.",
      "5) Motion-activated lighting lights the way",
      "Getting up in the middle of the night without enough light is a common recipe for a fall. Motion-activated lights can illuminate your path without you needing to touch a switch.",
      "What to look for: Try plug-in nightlights that turn on when they sense motion, or during a power outage. Some even double as portable flashlights.",

      "What to look for:\u00a0Choose ones that send alerts to your phone. You'll avoid a fall and possibly a pricey repair bill.",
      "7) Doorbell cameras keep you from rushing",
      "One overlooked fall trigger is rushing to answer the door. A\u00a0doorbell camera lets you see who's there and speak to them, so you can take your time or decide not to answer at all.",

      "8) Fall-detection devices can call for help",
      "Even the most independent older adults face higher fall risks, and family members who live far away may worry more than they let on. If a fall happens and you're alone, getting help quickly is essential. Wearables like the\u00a0Apple Watch can detect a hard fall and automatically alert emergency services or your emergency contacts.\u00a0Apple Watch SE, Series 4 or later, and Apple Watch Ultra include fall detection. If a hard fall is detected, the watch vibrates, sounds an alarm, and gives the option to call emergency services.",

By using smart tech, you can spot early warning signs, make smarter choices, and stay in control of your health, on your own terms.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Getting older doesn't mean giving up your independence. In fact, the right technology can help extend it. Whether it's a\u00a0smartwatch that alerts family during a fall or a simple nightlight that turns on automatically, every tool you use can add peace of mind.

      "The tunnels remain the most formidable element of Hamas\u2019 defense. Unlike ISIS terrorists in Mosul, Spencer said, Hamas has built an underground tunnel network that allows commanders and fighters to move between positions, avoid strikes and\u00a0conceal hostages. \"The IDF that will go into Gaza City is not the IDF of 2023,\" Spencer said, pointing to rapid adaptations in the use of drones, robots and specialized units for tunnel warfare. \"They\u2019ve learned so much. But this will still be slow, very careful and costly.\"",
      "To illustrate the scale, Spencer pointed to the 2004 battle for Fallujah in Iraq. \"It took the Marine Corps about two weeks to clear Fallujah\u2014every single home, building, shop. About 68,000 structures were cleared, as if somebody physically looked in them,\" he said. \"If all five of these [IDF] divisions were doing that, absolutely, you could get it done in a few months. But the enemy always gets a vote. You can\u2019t rush to failure.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump brokering a deal with Azerbaijan and Armenia on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new deal in the South Caucasus has ended a decades-long conflict and handed Washington a rare strategic foothold on Iran\u2019s northern border, experts say.",
      "The agreement, signed earlier this month between Armenia and Azerbaijan, grants the U.S. a 99-year lease over the Zangezur Corridor - a narrow strip of land that will serve as a critical trade and energy route to Europe, bypassing Tehran entirely. Iranian American journalist and dissident Banafsheh Zand told Fox News Digital the move is \"a wonderful gain for the U.S.\" that also delivers a \"slap in the face\" to the regime in Tehran.",
      "The corridor has long been at the center of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which displaced tens of thousands and fueled three decades of instability. Trump\u2019s intervention brought both sides to the table and created what observers say is a new trade and security lifeline linking the Caspian Basin to Europe, bypassing Iran entirely.",

      "A view from Armenia's southern border reveals the Arax River, with Iran visible across the water. This crossing is a vital lifeline for Armenia, facilitating essential trade and energy flows, especially as tensions rise over the proposed Zangezur Corridor. Iran strongly opposes the corridor, fearing it would sever its direct land access to Armenia and diminish its role as a regional transit hub. The corridor, intended to connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, has become a flashpoint in regional geopolitics. (Anthony Pizzoferrato/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Known as the Trump Route for Peace & Prosperity (TRIPP), economically, the agreement secures Washington a direct role in overseeing the flow of Caspian hydrocarbons to Europe. The U.S. will manage rail and road infrastructure, telecom networks and energy pipelines running through the corridor, giving American companies a dominant position in regional transit for oil, gas and goods. By controlling this artery, the U.S. not only generates billions in future trade and investment but also locks Europe into alternative supply routes that reduce reliance on both Russia and Iran.",
      "For allies, the corridor offers cheaper and safer access to Caspian energy. For Tehran, it represents lost revenue, lost leverage, and the end of its ability to act as a mandatory gatekeeper for east-west commerce.",
      "Zand said the deal is not only historic but also a direct win for Washington. \"It\u2019s a wonderful gain for the U.S.,\" she said. \"American contractors will be supervising oil and gas from the Caspian Basin, routed through Zangezur and Turkey to Europe. The profit margins are great, and it all happens under NATO\u2019s blessing.\"",
      "Zand said the potential goes even further. \"Nobody\u2019s talking about it yet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to see U.S. bases there,\" she said. \"If that happens, then checkmate the Khamenei regime and Russia.\"",

US President Donald Trump said Friday that Armenia and Azerbaijan were committed to a permanent peace as he hosted a White House summit with the leaders of the two South Caucasus nations, which have fought for decades. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, the corridor represents what Zand called a nightmare scenario. Tehran has long used its geography to shape energy and trade flows. By inserting the U.S. into the region, the new deal effectively strips Iran of that leverage. Zand put it in stark terms: \"Iran is shaped like a cat, a sitting cat. This corridor literally runs above the cat\u2019s ears. It bypasses Iran, takes money away from the regime, and pushes them out into the cold.\"",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Iran Program, said the corridor exposes how vulnerable Iran has become in the Caucasus. \"Both the defeat of Armenia in the most recent war with Azerbaijan, as well as the political problems between Moscow and Yerevan today, have made it harder for the Islamic Republic to really benefit from its traditional economic and political relationship with Armenia,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "An infographic titled \u2018Construction of roads and railways extending to the Zangezur Corridor continues without interruption.\u2019 Once constructed, the corridor will connect Azerbaijan's western provinces and Nakhchivan via Armenia, further stretching to China, Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey.\u00a0 (Yasin Demirci/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "\"They still do have ties, and the regime is an opportunistic actor as much as it is an ideological one. If there is any way to throw stones at this agreement, or extract concessions on the back end, they will try.\"",
      "At the same time, he said the strategic picture is clear. \"The Islamic Republic is, in essence, carved out of this route,\" he said. \"This is not just a critical corridor that could bring stability to the South Caucasus and economic improvement for all countries involved-it also drives home the point that the regime has been such a poor guardian of Iran\u2019s national interest that the Iranian state has been excluded from a major transit route just above its border.\"",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the media during voting for parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran in May 2024. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The timing, Zand argued, makes the impact even greater. She pointed to Iran\u2019s weakening position since October 7, 2023, and Israel's recent 12-day war with Tehran. \"The regime was self-isolated when it couldn\u2019t come to Hamas\u2019s or Hezbollah\u2019s rescue. Iraq\u2019s Shiites are saying they don\u2019t want to be controlled, Syria is out, and Hezbollah has been degraded. For those of us who\u2019ve watched the regime for decades, we always knew it was a paper tiger. October 7 and the war exposed it to the world.\"",
      "The killing of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists has deepened the sense of vulnerability inside Tehran. \"They can huff and puff about blowing the house down, but the truth is, there\u2019s a whole lot of fear among the regime\u2019s leaders now,\" Zand said. \"Khamenei has even gone into hiding again.\"",
      "TRUMP BRINGS PEACE TO CAUCASUS: INSIDE THE ARMENIA\u2013AZERBAIJAN DEAL 30 YEARS IN THE MAKING",
      "Ben Taleblu added that Washington is now using these shifts to turn Iran\u2019s weakness into opportunity. \"Wherever the regime is weak, that invites pushback, whether militarily or economically,\" he said. \"The U.S. has followed Israel\u2019s military success against the Islamic Republic with strikes of its own against nuclear facilities, and it is now following Azerbaijan\u2019s battlefield success with a political and economic success of its own. This corridor is another example of America moving in when Tehran is most vulnerable.\"",
      "An aerial view of the construction of roads and railways that will pass through the Zangezur Corridor, which will connect the western provinces with Nakhchivan and will also be one of the routes of the Central Corridor extending from China to Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Zand, whose father was a well-known Iranian journalist and intellectual assassinated by the regime, said she views Trump\u2019s direct involvement as the key to the corridor\u2019s success. \"Because it\u2019s Trump, it makes all the difference,\" she said. \u00a0\"Trump doesn\u2019t care about not hurting people\u2019s feelings. He responds to how people act. And with this move, he\u2019s sitting over Iran like a vulture-ominous, watching, ready.\"",
      "For dissidents like Zand, the corridor represents more than a transport route. \"We\u2019ve prayed for this for decades,\" she said. \"Until the regime is gone, people inside Iran will remain too afraid to rise up again. But this corridor is a boon. It shows the regime is surrounded, and its days are numbered.\"",

      "The deal was reached with NATO backing and has already been compared by some observers to historic peace accords. Zand believes the significance lies not only in ending a 30-year conflict but also in turning the U.S. presence in the Caucasus into a permanent reality. \"The regime knows the jig is up.\"",

    "story": [
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the man who the government says was mistakenly deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador, will meet with immigration officials Monday under the looming threat of a second deportation, this time to Uganda.",
      "Abrego's case \u2014 a flashpoint in the Trump administrations crackdown on immigration \u2014 is now at a major crossroads.",
      "He was released from federal custody on parole Friday and had a tearful reunion with his family after nearly half a year apart.",
      "But the Trump administration has doubled down on its resolve to deport him, alleging he is a member of the violent gang MS-13 \u2014 a claim his attorneys have repeatedly denied.",
      "Abrego had been deported in March in what the White House called an \u201cadministrative error,\u201d and after a tedious legal saga, he was returned to the United States in June. But he was immediately detained again, this time on human smuggling charges in Tennessee. He pleaded not guilty to those charges.",
      "Minutes after his release, immigration authorities notified Abrego that they intend to deport him to Uganda. Separately, the Trump administration offered him a plea deal that would ensure his eventual deportation to Costa Rica.",
      "On Friday night, the government informed Abrego that he has until \"first thing\" Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, \"or else that offer will be off the table forever,\" Abrego's attorneys wrote in a filing as part of their efforts to get the charges in Tennessee dropped over what they consider to be a \"vindictive\" and \"selective\" prosecution.",
      "Here are how Monday's appointment may play out:",
      "Monday\u2019s ICE check-in",
      "Abrego will have a check-in with Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Baltimore on Monday as part of the conditions of his release from federal custody on parole.",
      "Typically, such an ICE check-in is a brief meeting with an officer from ICE\u2019s Enforcement and Removal Operations to review case status, provide updates and confirm where a person is living. Usually, a person is released until the next scheduled check-in.",
      "But Abrego's attorneys told NBC News they expect he will be taken into ICE custody during the check-in, given the Trump administration's notice of its intention to deport him.",
      "A judge ruled in July that the government had to provide 72 hours\u2019 notice, excluding weekends, if it intends to deport Abrego to a third country, which the Justice Department provided Friday afternoon.",
      "Abrego\u2019s lawyers have said he illegally immigrated to the United States when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland to escape gang violence in El Salvador.",
      "His deportation to El Salvador violated a 2019 court order that protected him from being deported to his home country because of concerns that he\u2019d be persecuted by violent gangs. But that order doesn\u2019t prevent his deportation to any other country.",
      "What may happen from here?",
      "Several paths could unfold from here: Abrego could take the plea deal and eventually be deported to Costa Rica or he could refuse to and be deported to Uganda, or his lawyers could fight Uganda as a deportation option.",
      "If Abrego doesn\u2019t change his plea in the Tennessee federal case, he could be deported to Uganda as soon as Wednesday.",
      "However, Abrego couldn\u2019t face the criminal charges of human smuggling brought against him by Justice Department in that case if he is removed from the country. His trial is set for January in Nashville.",
      "Last week, Uganda agreed to a deal with the United States to take deported migrants, as long as they don\u2019t have criminal records and aren\u2019t unaccompanied minors. Uganda\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry said Uganda prefers that migrants sent there be of African nationalities.",
      "Abrego\u2019s attorneys could also try to prevent his deportation to Uganda altogether and try to convince an immigration judge within 72 hours that he is likely to experience persecution or torture there. An immigration judge would have to agree to prevent his deportation to Uganda.",
      "On Saturday, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, one of Abrego\u2019s attorneys, accused the government of \u201cpunishing\u201d Abrego for \u201cexercising his constitutional rights.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is preposterous that they would send him to Africa, to a country where he doesn\u2019t even speak the language, a country with documented human rights violations, when there are so many other options. This family has suffered enough,\u201d Sandoval-Moshenberg said outside Abrego\u2019s brother's home.",
      "He said they intend to \u201cfight tooth and nail\u201d against deportation to Uganda, South Sudan, Libya and \u201cany other completely ridiculous country that they can come up with.\u201d",
      "What if Abrego takes a plea deal?",
      "Alternatively, Abrego could take a plea deal the Trump administration offered.",
      "That deal would require him to plead guilty to both counts of the criminal indictment against him in Tennessee, serve time and then be deported.",
      "Should Abrego plead guilty or be convicted by a jury, the charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in federal prison. Under either scenario, U.S. District Judge Wesley Crenshaw in Nashville would determine how much time he would serve.",
      "If he is eventually deported to Costa Rica, Abrego would be welcomed as a refugee and live as a free man, the Costa Rican government said in a letter one of Abrego's attorneys submitted to the court as part of the filing in the Tennessee case.",
      "In the filing, attorney Sean Hecker said the Justice Department, Homeland Security and ICE were \u201cusing their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat.\u201d",
      "Sandoval-Moshenberg called the Costa Rica plea deal offer \u201cpretty reasonable\u201d Saturday, saying: \u201cCosta Rica makes sense. It\u2019s a Spanish-speaking country. It\u2019s proximate to the United States. His family can visit him there easily.\u201d",
      "Abrego's case has sparked heated debate and intense scrutiny over the Trump administration's immigration policies, including the race to deport people \u2014 at times without due process \u2014 aggressive ICE raids and sordid detainment facility conditions."

      "A spokesperson for the task force said National Guard members supporting safety and security will be armed, whereas troops who are assigned to \u201cbeautification\u201d tasks across the district, which includes tasks like community restoration, most likely will not be.",
      "Several armed National Guard troops were seen Sunday evening patrolling the Chinatown neighborhood of D.C., wearing patches labeled \"MP\" to signify their role as military police.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Friday ordered the authorization of roughly 2,000 National Guard troops in D.C. to begin carrying weapons. It marked a shift in the posture of the guard members, who had been unarmed as they worked to support law enforcement by assisting with community safety patrols, traffic control points and crowd flow support.",
      "The federal task force said it is \"currently staffing\" a request by local police for \"increased Guardsmen presence at pre-specified metro locations\" to coincide with the start of school year for many D.C. area schools.",

      "More than 2,200 National Guard soldiers and airmen, a majority from out of state, have been deployed to D.C. to support what Trump has framed as a concerted effort to tackle crime and homelessness in the nation's capital. At the time of the initial troop deployment this month, violent crime had dropped roughly 27% year over year, according to D.C. police data. Currently guard members from D.C., West Virginia, South Carolina, Ohio, Mississippi, Louisiana and Tennessee are assisting the District and federal government agencies.",
      "Nearly 60% of guard members in D.C. are from out of the district after several Republican state leaders sent hundreds of troops there. West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey deployed more than 400 troops to D.C. \"as a show of commitment\" to Trump's initiative, the most of any state leader.",
      "Democrats have bashed the deployment as partisan in nature, accusing Trump of trying to exert his presidential authority through scare tactics and noting that his primary targets have been cities with Black leadership.",
      "Trump threatened Sunday to send the military into Baltimore after he sparred with Democratic Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, deriding the city as \"crime-ridden.\"",

      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d the vice president added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Russia\u2019s top diplomat, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, put a damper on hopes that Trump will propel a swift end to the war in Ukraine.",
      "He told \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker that Ukraine has hindered the process, saying Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders \u201cdon\u2019t want peace.\u201d",
      "\u201cZelenskyy said no to everything,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cHow can we meet with a person who is pretending to be a leader?\u201d",
      "Lavrov said Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy \u201cwhen the agenda is ready.\u201d But he suggested that Putin would not sign a peace agreement with Zelenskyy, whose legitimacy Moscow has questioned since Ukrainian elections were postponed last year amid martial law.",
      "\u201cWhen we come to a stage when you have to sign documents, we would need a very clear understanding by everybody that the person who is signing is legitimate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd according to the Ukrainian constitution, Mr. Zelenskyy is not at the moment.\u201d",

      "National Guard troops deployed to Washington this month to support Trump\u2019s effort to mitigate crime will begin carrying firearms Sunday evening, according to a Defense Department official with knowledge of the planning.",
      "The majority of the guard members will carry M17 pistols, their service-issued weapons, the official said, while a small number of the troops will be armed with M4 rifles. The troops are authorized to use their weapons for self-protection.",
      "A White House official told NBC News that despite being armed, as of Saturday night, the National Guard troops in D.C. are not making arrests and will continue to focus their work on protecting federal assets and providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers making arrests.",
      "Justice Department gave Ghislaine Maxwell \u2018a platform to rewrite history,\u2019 family of Virginia Giuffre says",
      "Family members of Virginia Giuffre, a prominent Jeffrey Epstein accuser, said they were \u201coutraged\u201d by the Justice Department\u2019s decision to release transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s testimony last month, arguing the interviews provided Maxwell a \u201cplatform to rewrite history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe content of these transcripts is in direct contradiction with felon Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s conviction for child sex trafficking,\u201d the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre said in a statement. The family added, \u201cThis travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department on Friday released audio and transcripts of the two-day interview, during which Maxwell disputed several allegations of wrongdoing against her and Epstein, including by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.",
      "Maxwell said she never witnessed any inappropriate conduct from any man, including Trump, and denied the existence of an incriminating \u201cclient list\u201d of those who benefited from Epstein\u2019s crimes.",
      "On \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Sen. Adam Schiff echoed the Giuffre family\u2019s view, claiming that Maxwell has the motivation to say anything that could potentially get her pardoned.",

      "The federal takeover of Washington has sparked a fierce debate over the state of crime in the city. What\u2019s beyond dispute is that carjackings exploded during the pandemic and are not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s a particularly brutal crime, experts say, one that often causes lasting psychological damage.",
      "\u201cIt became the crime of the pandemic,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based organization of current and former law enforcement officials focused on improving policing. \u201cAnd the reason you still have it is because juveniles learned how to do it. That presents a lot of challenges for the justice system.\u201d",
      "The soaring number of young people who have engaged in carjacking is indeed one of the key factors that has driven the surge in the Washington area and beyond, according to interviews with more than half a dozen police officials, criminologists and youth advocates.",
      "Some of these perpetrators stole vehicles to use them to commit more crimes. Many others commit carjackings simply for the thrill of it, or to earn respect and attention on social media, according to police investigators and advocates who have spoken to the young offenders.",
      "Over the last 18 months, the carjacking numbers have fallen in the area. Sgt. Josh Scall, a supervisor in the carjacking unit in neighboring Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, said he\u2019s proud of the progress, but even one carjacking is one more than he wants to see in his county.",
      "\u201cWe can parade that we\u2019re not at 573,\u201d Scall added, referring to the record number of carjackings recorded in Prince George\u2019s in 2023. \u201cBut it\u2019s still unacceptable in our books.\u201d",
      "Sending a freshman off to college is almost always an expensive endeavor, but the latest viral trend is taking back-to-school shopping to the next level.",
      "Extreme dorm makeovers are becoming increasingly popular, with some parents shelling out tens of thousands of dollars and hiring professional interior designers to transform their kids\u2019 humble abodes into the dorm rooms of their dreams.",
      "Far removed from the beat-up mini-fridges and crooked posters of the past, the dramatic transformations are unnecessary, some say, and reflect the widening line between the haves and have-nots in the United States.",
      "\u201cWealth disparity just becomes obvious on a college campus, because suddenly your lifestyle is either funded by you or it\u2019s not,\u201d said Mya Mendola, who graduated from the University of Minnesota last year.",

      "Trump\u2019s push to deploy National Guard troops to cities like D.C. is a significant departure from how presidents typically deploy the Guard, which is usually used to respond to situations like natural disasters and civil unrest.",

      "He\u2019d later direct the revival in 1976 after having worked on shows like \u201cAnnie,\u201d \u201cMarlene Dietrich\u201d and \u201cWe Interrupt This Program...\u201d as a production supervisor and director.",
      "Adler wouldn\u2019t receive his first acting credit until 1991, when he appeared on an episode of \u201cBrooklyn Bridge.\u201d He appeared on popular television series such as \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d and \u201cLaw & Order\u201d and even had some leading roles in shows like \u201cHudson Street.\u201d",
      "But the world will most likely best remember Adler for his six seasons on the HBO series \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d",
      "Hesh Rabkin, played by Adler, was a confident to lead character Tony Soprano, a troubled New Jersey mafia boss struggling with his work and his family.",
      "A recurring character, Rabkin was a loan shark who often doled out advice to the younger mafioso.",
      "\"Sopranos\" actor Michael Imperioli paid tribute to his former co-star on Instagram, describing Adler as a \"true class act\" and saying he loved spending time with him.",
      "\"JERRY ADLER (1929-2025) was a fantastic actor and the kindest of human beings,\" Imperioli wrote. \"He brought so much humor, intelligence and truth to the role of Herman 'Hesh' Rabkin and was one of my favorite characters on The Sopranos.",
      "Adler made appearances in a number of other hit series, such as \u201cBroad City,\u201d \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d He was a recurring guest on \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d a legal procedural led by Julianna Margulies.",
      "Robert King, co-creator of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d recalled Adler\u2019s role on the show as Howard Lyman in a social media post Sunday. He described Adler as \u201cone of our favorite collaborators.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe intent was only to have him for one episode of THE GOOD WIFE, but he was so funny in a diner scene, yelling \u2018I said ice cream, you stupid b----\u2019 we had him back for six years of Good Wife and three years of Good Fight,\u201d King wrote.",
      "What was meant to be one episode turned into 30 for Adler, according to his IMDb page. He then appeared in two episodes of the show\u2019s spinoff \u201cThe Good Fight.\u201d",
      "People shared kind words about Adler in the comments of his online obituary, with some who knew him personally sharing memories. A woman named Sharon Aiuvalasit wrote that she was able to go to the set of her favorite show, \"Santa Barbara,\" because of a family friend who knew Adler.",
      "\"Jerry welcomed my mom, dad and little brother to the set for 12 hours and it continues to be one of the most magical memories of my life,\" Aiuvalasit wrote.",
      "A man named Jimmy Horton recalled that his very first job at 18 was working with Adler on the drama \"Search for Tomorrow.\" He worked on Broadway over the years and reunited with Adler in Larry David's 2015 play, \"Fish in the Dark.\"",
      "\"When rehearsals started I reintroduced myself and we reminisced about Search and the great people there and I got to see Jerry as an actor six nights a week for several months and he was a delight, a real mensch and a terrific actor to see up close,\" Horton wrote.",
      "Adler wrote a memoir released last year called \"Too Funny for Words,\" writing about moments like his first job working for his father as an assistant stage manager on \"Gentleman Prefer Blondes.\" He told CT Insider in an interview promoting his book that he had to lead Carol Channing by flashlight because she was \"terribly near-sighted.\"",
      "Asked about his career, Adler told the outlet that \"it's been a glorious run.\"",
      "\"I wrote this book during the pandemic because I thought the world could use some laughs,\" Adler said. \"I still have more stories to tell, too, about working on the Tony Awards shows, about all the summer stock productions, about all the 'My Fair Lady' revivals.  Maybe there can be 'Too Funny for Words, Part Two.'\""

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance remains confident the U.S. can broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine despite potential hang-ups that have emerged since President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Vance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured  several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.",
      "\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.",
      "During his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Welker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.",
      "Vance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d",
      "The interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.",
      "On Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.",
      "In the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.",
      "\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d",
      "Trump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d",
      "While acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.",
      "\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d",
      "Putin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d",
      "Asked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d",
      "The interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "On the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.",
      "\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d",
      "Welker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.",
      "\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month abolishing the trade loophole known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d which since 2016 had allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "The end of the exemption is being extended worldwide after the loophole was closed in May for packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "Under the new rules, personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free, but all other packages will face the same tariffs as standard imports from their country of origin.",
      "The planned policy shift, which operators say lacks clear procedures, has raised concerns about backlogs as services are put on hold.",
      "Postal providers in Belgium, Denmark and New Zealand are among several operators that have already suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. until they can retool their systems to comply with the new rules. Letters and documents are generally unaffected.",
      "Services in Germany, France, Britain and India have announced they will follow suit in the coming days.",
      "France\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said in a statement that the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time to prepare for new customs procedures. New Zealand\u2019s postal service said parcel deliveries to all U.S. states and territories would be \u201ctemporarily unavailable until further notice\u201d while systems are updated to meet new U.S. customs requirements.",
      "DHL, one of the world\u2019s largest courier companies, said Friday that it will stop accepting parcels containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S. beginning Monday.",
      "The company cited unresolved \u201ckey questions\u201d about the process, including \u201chow and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\u201d",
      "DHL will, however, continue to deliver private parcels labeled as gifts valued under $100, in line with White House assurances.",

      "It said the number of de minimis parcels jumped from 134 million in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024 as shippers \u201cdeceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties,  inspection, and U.S. law.\u201d",
      "Most of those packages came from mainland China and Hong Kong, which the Trump administration initially targeted as part of efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value goods from China-linked retailers such as Temu and Shein.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m a Black artist, I\u2019m apparently a rapper, even though \u2018Hotline Bling\u2019 is not a rap song,\u201d Drake said during in an interview with U.K. DJ Semtex. \u201cThe only category that they can manage to fit me in is in a rap category, maybe because I\u2019ve rapped in the past or because I\u2019m black. I can\u2019t figure out why.\u201d",
      "In 2019, the last time Drake attended the Grammys, he accepted the award for best rap song for \"God's Plan\" and gave a pointed acceptance speech about how he and the other artists there that night \u201cplay in an opinion-based sport, not a factual-based sport.\u201d",
      "After his album \u201cCertified Lover Boy\u201d was nominated in 2022 for best rap album and his single \u201cWay 2 Sexy\u201d was nominated for best rap performance, Drake asked the Recording Academy to remove his work from the nominations. The Academy honored Drake\u2019s request and rapper didn\u2019t attend the awards show.",
      "In 2023, although Drake refused to submit his 2022 album, \u201cHonestly, Nevermind,\u201d or any of its songs for consideration by the Grammys, he received four nominations. Once again, however, Drake boycotted the awards show.",
      "In 2024, Drake received four Grammy nominations for his joint 2022 album with 21 Savage, \u201cHer Loss.\u201d Per the Grammys, Drake \u201csubmitted material for nomination for the 2024 GRAMMYs,\u201d but the rapper, who did not attend that year, ultimately did not take home an award.",
      "The Weeknd has also had a winding history with the Grammys, receiving 14 nominations and four wins over the years.",
      "After his his \u201cBlinding Lights\u201d and \u201cAfter Hours\u201d were snubbed from nominations at the 2021 ceremony, The Weeknd announced he would not submit his work to Recording Academy.",
      "He told The New York Times at the time that he will \u201cno longer allow my label to submit my music to the Grammys\u201d due to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process.",
      "From 2022 to 2024, the singer boycotted the award show, until an unexpected return this past year, when the Weeknd sang \u201cCry For Me\u201d and \u201cTimeless\u201d with Playboi Carti from his new album, \u201cHurry Up Tomorrow.\u201d",
      "Irish singer-songwriter and activist Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor first performed at the Grammys in 1989, just two years before writing an open letter to the Recording Academy, criticizing \u201cfalse and destructive materialistic values.\u201d",
      "Just a year prior to O'Connor's pointed \"SNL\" performance, during which she destroyed a photo of Pope John Paul II on live television, she dropped her planned Grammys performance and published her 1991 letter.",
      "Directing her message to both the Academy and the industry at large, O'Connor wrote, per the Los Angeles Times, \u201cThey acknowledge mostly the commercial side of art. They respect mostly material gain, since that is the main reason for their existence. And they have created a great respect among artists for material gain--by honoring us and exalting us when we achieve it, ignoring for the most part those of us who have not.\u201d",
      "O'Connor won the best alternative music performance Grammy in 1991 for her album, \"I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got,\u201d but refused to accept the award, marking the first time in the award show's history that an artist rejected a win.",
      "O\u2019Connor's letter led to waves of artists refusing to attend the show.",
      "When best rap performance by a duo or group was not televised at the 1991 Grammys \u2014 following the award show's history of not televising wins in the rap category \u2014 nominee Public Enemy decided to boycott the show and released their own statement, via their label head Russell Simmons, that year.",
      "When Living Colour guitarist Vernon Reid accepted the 1991 win for Best Hard Rock Performance, he donned a T-shirt displaying a giant photo of O'Connor.",
      "In 2022, Bruno Mars told Rolling Stone that he and Anderson .Paak, who together make up R&B duo Silk Sonic, withdrew their album, \"An Evening with Silk Sonic\" from Grammys consideration.",
      "\u201cWe truly put our all on this record, but Silk Sonic would like to gracefully, humbly and most importantly, sexually, bow out of submitting our album this year,\u201d Mars told the outlet. \u201cWe hope we can celebrate with everyone on a great year of music and partake in the party. Thank you for letting Silk Sonic thrive.\u201d",
      "The two artists did not attend the 2023 ceremony.",
      "Mars has received 33 Grammys nominations and 16 wins. His last win was at this past year's ceremony in best pop duo/group performance for \"Die With a Smile,\" his duet with Lady Gaga.",
      "Why Are Artists Removing Themselves From Grammy Consideration?",
      "While some artist have removed their work from future considerations after past snubs, others have took a stronger stance against the Recording Academy.",
      "While Drake has been vocal about his message that a Grammy win \u201cdoesn\u2019t dictate s---- in our world\u201d as an artist, he has also made reference to his frustration with the Grammys in his music. In his 2023 collaboration with J. Cole, \u201cFirst Person Shooter,\u201d Drake boasts, \u201cI told Jimmy Jam I use a Grammy as a door stop.\u201d",
      "When The Weeknd refused to submit his work for Grammys consideration in 2021, he referred to \u201csecret committees\u201d involved in the nomination process when talking to The New York Times.",
      "In O'Connor's 1991 open letter criticizing the Recording Academy, she wrote that they \u201cacknowledge mostly the commercial side of art.

    "story": [
      "Winona Ryder became one of Hollywood's hottest celebrities in the 1990s thanks in part to her offbeat fashion choices.",
      "By the time Ryder starred alongside Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo and Ethan Hawke in the 1994 cult movie \"Reality Bites,\" her edgy looks \u2014 a vintage thrift store dress with chunky shoes one day, an Armani men's suit the next \u2014\u00a0had turned her into a style icon.",
      "The \"Stranger Things\" star, 53, opened up about her style influences in a video interview with Elle UK. Her love of men's suits, she told the publication, was inspired by the kooky 1976 kids' gangster flick \"Bugsy Malone.\"",
      "\"Even when I didn't have any money and was in school, we would always shop at the Salvation Army, and I was always picking out, like, the boys' three-piece suits because I wanted to be like the kids in 'Bugsy Malone,'\" recalled Ryder.",
      "Many of Ryder's iconic looks were achieved by accident, she said. That choppy layered \u201cReality Bites\u201d haircut that all the Gen X girls flipped for? Turns out, it was a DIY cut Ryder gave herself.",
      "\"All during the \u201890s I cut my own hair,\u201d said Ryder. \"And I remember being incredibly surprised and flattered that my 'Reality Bites' haircut became (popular), or, you know, girls would go to the (hair salon) and bring that picture in, and I thought that was kind of cool.\u201d",
      "Though the haircut was a hit, Ryder is the first to admit she has no clue how to cut hair properly.",
      "\u201cI mean, I literally just put my head upside down and went like that with the scissors. And I did that for any of my short hair,\u201d she explained.",
      "Despite being singled out for her hip style in the '90s, Ryder said her \"relationship to fashion\" during the era was \"probably not what a lot of people think it was.\"",
      "\"If I went to an event, I would wear a designer. Often I wore a lot of vintage,\" she said. \"I was working really quite a lot in the '90s so I was often just on sets and wearing jeans and a T-shirt.\"",
      "Ryder told Elle UK she collects concert T-shirts.",
      "\"I have a T-shirt from every show I've been to, which started very young,\" she shared. \"My dad took me to a lot of the early, like, late '70s, early '80s punk rock (concerts).\"",
      "Ryder said she still has the first concert T-shirt she ever owned, from The Clash's short 1980 tour of the United States. The shirt is so old that it's unwearable, she said, so she keeps it framed.",
      "Looking back, Ryder says her fashion choices in the '90s were all about being true to herself.",
      "\"You know when you're in your 20s, you try to, I don't know, you almost try to do what wasn't trendy. Because a lot of the trends were, I'm sorry, they were awful,\" she said. \"I just wanted to be my own self, and I was also very into recycling and showing people that you can look good and not spend a ton of money.",
      "\"Things are not meant to be worn only once,\" added Ryder. \"That was what always drove me nuts about the events. I remember re-wearing things a lot and apparently that was looked down upon sometimes. I thought it was a great thing.\""

    "published": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:06:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Shawn Hatosy previews Season 2 of \"The Pitt,\" shares why the show is resonating so much and how he's preparing to direct Episode 9.",
    "story": [
      "Shawn Hatosy is getting ready to clock back in for a shift at \"The Pitt.\"",
      "The medical drama, which premiered in January 2025, is on a fast track rarely seen in streaming shows these days. Filming for Season 2 is well underway, and a teaser for the sophomore outing dropped Aug. 21. But eagle-eyed fans may have noticed that Hatosy's character, the internet's favorite night shift attending, Dr. Jack Abbot, wasn't seen in any of the clips.",
      "Shabana Azeez, who stars in the show as medical student Victoria Javadi, joked on her Instagram that Abbot is in a \"retirement home.\" Hatosy has another explanation.",
      "\"I have not shown up yet,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"I'm still about to, so getting prepared for that. I know the cast and crew have been diligently kicking away for a couple months now. So I'm getting ready.\"",
      "The 15-episode procedural \"The Pitt\" has received acclaim for its unconventional format \u2014 each episode reflects one hour of an emergency room shift, with the whole season comprising just one day in the life. Season 1 opens with senior emergency attending Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, played by Noah Wyle, arriving for his shift, relieving a distraught Abbot. In the first episode, Robinavitch finds Abbot on the roof, who asks why they continue to show up at the grueling job each day.",
      "By the end of the season, Abbot makes a triumphant return to the emergency department in the wake of a mass casualty shooting. He ends the day answering his own question\u00a0\u2014 \"We\u2019re the bees that protect the hive,\" he says \u2014 effectively solidifying his character's arc and making Abbot a \"fully formed character,\" Hatosy says.",
      "\"I feel like I have his backstory down to this point,\" Hatosy says. \"I do believe that they will throw a monkey wrench into that.\"",
      "Below, Hatosy previews what could be in store for Abbot in Season 2, unpacks his character's buzzy chemistry with Dr. Samira Mohan (Supriya Ganesh) and reflects on being nominated for an Emmy Award for best guest actor in a drama series.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "I don't actually know the answer to the first question.",
      "I love the show. I love the character. I think that the night shift has a lot of elements that people respond to. I think it takes a certain type of individual to decide to work nights, and Abbot would be the leader of that because his therapist says he finds comfort in the darkness. I would love to check in once the original \"Pitt\" is up and running, because that's the first priority. But if the writers have the bandwidth for it, I mean, I would love it.",
      "I think No. 1, the medicine. We don't dumb it down in any way. We treat it as it is. So I think the audience, even though they may not understand it \u2014\u00a0I certainly don't understand some of the things that are happening \u2014 there's a trust there. You expect them to follow it, and they do.",
      "I also think the immersive feeling of the narrative being one day, I think it adds to the excitement and the adrenaline. And then the characters are all so well drawn. Each has their own distinct point of view, and people respond to that. I also think that they're all inherently decent people working there, and in a world that's very divided right now, they have pledged to take care of everybody and do their job and save lives.",
      "They do. I'm the target of that sometimes.",
      "Oh yeah, of course. There's always a healthy dose of nerves and fear when you're both directing and acting. The first time you present a character on a TV show, it's terrifying because you're like, \"Whatever I do now I have to commit to for however many years this goes.\" So there's just a lot of anxiety. With directing, you're responsible for so many departments and ideas, and it's definitely scary, but that is what keeps you working so hard. It's a good scary. It's the kind that you need to sort of give you that lift.",
      "But like you said, listen, I'm a performer. So there's a language that actors have with each other. So my first point of attention is always going to be towards the performance, because that's where I come from. So even though they may call me old and a grandpa and chronically online, or whatever they say, I will power through it.",
      "I've said it before, there was a scene early on where he talks about how she's one of the smartest people here. I think that he's not just saying that, I think he believes that. He just respects her. I think he sees her as the future of the ER. There's some light flirting happening, and it's definitely layered into the script. Some writers may say, \"No, we were just putting stuff there.\" But it seems obvious to me. I think that the scene with the pigtail catheter, where he's ... sort of insisting that she do it, even though there's only one case in history of this exact procedure that's ever been done \u2014 it just shows how much he respects her. And sometimes that can turn into something more, you know, when you're working together.",
      "We haven't. I'm actually curious to see how she feels. She might be like, \"Ew, gross,\" and it's possible.",
      "I did read something that Noah said online yesterday in an interview where he was talking about Abbot in Season 2. I don't know much, but I did hear him say that they're going to delve deeper into Abbot's backstory and his relationship with his deceased wife. He still wears his wedding ring. That's one of the pieces of hidden trauma that I knew about, but we haven't gone into yet, but I think we might deal with it this season.",
      "It's still a mystery to me. I've received scripts, though. I'm just about now ready to sit down and plunge in. For directing, I'm going to have to catch up.",
      "They're kind of mirror images of each other, but one is night, one is day. (Laughs). I think the writers did a really nice job of the way that they presented the bookends of the roof scenes. Abbot, seemingly coming off of a horrendous night shift, losing this vet who he spent three hours trying to save, I think that affected him and made him question his purpose. And by the end of the shift, he's up on the roof and the roles are reversed now. Robby has had his worst day, and Abbot is metaphorically talking him off the ledge.",
      "But Abbot's purpose is crystallized in that moment. He figures out that the reason that he keeps coming back is because they're the bees that protect the hive. It's in his DNA \u2014 I think that that line is pure Abbot. It's the spine of how I shape that character.",
      "I think he is in many ways, at least at the end of Season 1, a kind of a fully formed character, whereas Robby has experienced a type of PTSD that will need attention. Abbot has proven and said that he's working on himself, and it'll be nice to find out if Robby will go that path.",
      "I don't know about that. There's so much about just the way he carries himself that's very much me. I was trying to avoid creating something that was transformative. I wanted him to be as close to me as possible. Sometimes that can be challenging, playing somebody that's very close to you, somebody that's like you. So there's that.",
      "I think it's amazing that he's had a rough night, and he's sitting there in his whatever, I don't know, house, van, I don't know, listening to a police scanner, just waiting for an emergency. I think that does say a lot about him. And I do think Season 2 will highlight a little bit more of what he does in his off time, and we will learn maybe why he does stuff like that.",
      "No, I think as actors, we often create these little things to give energy or life to a scene. ... That's kind of the training that you get as an actor. So it's just even the Mohan stuff, whether or not it was explicit, the nuance for me was always this sort of feeling of flutter that he gets with her. Because he does respect her, and she responds.",
      "You're always trying to build a backstory. And what's incredible about episodic television is sometimes even the writers create a backstory, and they tell you that, and then you get to, like, Season 3, and it completely changes, and you just have to accept that. That's how the stuff that I build in there\u00a0\u2014 it's never right, but you just kind of have it in there to bring nuance to the scene.",
      "I feel like I have his backstory down to this point. (Laughs.) I do believe that they will throw a monkey wrench into that. I've worked on John Wells-produced shows, this is my fifth show with him, and every single one of them, I've played pretty complex characters. Like for \"Southland,\" each season, Sammy Bryant would get to a place where I'm like, \"I don't know if he can recover from that.\" And then John will, and his staff of brilliant writers, always come up with a plan that knocks him down another peg. And I'm assuming that Abbot will have a very roller coaster, emotional plight.",
      "I'm feeling great. I'm so ... I'm overwhelmed. It means so much to get the support from the people in the business that do this. But more importantly, I think it's just exciting for the show, being recognized. I'm proud of the show. I think it has something important to say about health care workers, and it is a show that doesn't cost a lot of money compared to other shows, and it's shot in L.A. I think it's great for the business, this show, this model. And I hope that this success, the critical response, leads to more shows like it.",
      "And how I celebrated, (laughs), I was alone in a hotel room in Vancouver, actually. And my wife and I were on the phone, and then I received a lot of phone calls congratulating me. I think I've heard from everybody. And I don't drink anymore, and it's been a while since I've done that, but I actually was like, \"What am I going to do?\" So I went to Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver, and I played pickleball with complete strangers. So that's how I celebrated.",
      "No. (Laughs.) The nomination really is the win. It feels great. And it's been a grinding career, just grinding it out. So the nomination is great. Whatever happens from there? Thank you. And if not, OK. It's not going to change anything about how I work, or what this show looks like. We're gonna attack it from the same point of view.",
      "No, just go easy on me out there on the internet. I'm very sensitive."

    "story": [
      "When Angela Bassett started filming Season 8 of \"9-1-1,\" she had no idea of the heartbreak in store for her character.",
      "Bassett plays police Sgt. Athena Grant on the long-running first responder procedural drama. The eighth season, which aired from September 2024 to May 2025, opened with Athena having to land a plane after a swarm of bees caused a midair crash (really). But it ended with the truly unthinkable: the death of fire Capt. Bobby Nash (Peter Krause) \u2014 who has been married to Athena since the show's Season 2 finale \u2014 after he sacrificed his life to save his team during a tragic lab accident.",
      "In an exclusive interview with TODAY.com, Bassett reveals she found out about Bobby's tragic end \"late.\" In fact, she says she first received a \"fake script\" which portrayed the death of a different character, probationary firefighter Ravi (Anirudh Pisharody).",
      "\"We did twice as much work. We filmed (Ravi's) demise, and then the real one,\" Bassett says.",
      "But after she found out it was Bobby who was being killed off, she recalls waiting until she got to set to speak with Krause. Once she arrived, she immediately asked for her co-star, ran upstairs to speak with him and then, \"we just sort of looked at each other,\" she says.",
      "\"I mean we're grown-ups, we know things can go this way sometimes. I remember saying to him, 'Listen, I've died a horrible death a number of times. Even as a queen, they've taken me out,'\" she adds with a laugh, seemingly referring to the death of her character Queen Ramonda in 2022's \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",
      "\"'It happens to the best of us,'\" she recalls saying. \"You know, you try to make light, you face the reality of it.\"",
      "She adds that they embraced and felt \"grateful for the time and the love and the camaraderie and the moments that you did have together.\"",
      "\"As he said, I am his longest actor wife,\" she says.",
      "Bobby's death sent shockwaves throughout the \"9-1-1\" fandom as it marked the first major character death in the show's entire run.",
      "During the two-episode event, which aired April 10 and April 17, members of LAFD station 118 were trapped in a research lab and exposed to an aerosolized, mutated version of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever. After Chimney (Kenneth Choi) displayed symptoms of the virus, Athena and Buck (Oliver Stark) hunted down the one cure. After it was given to Chimney, Bobby revealed he was also infected, and Athena watched him die in quarantine through a glass wall.",
      "In a statement published by Variety after the episode aired, Krause said he would miss his \"9-1-1 family,\" with a special shoutout to \"my partner, Angela Bassett. Her strength and her sweetness, and us holding hands. We parted ways too soon. Much love.\""

      "In the footage, 21-year-old Aaden looks amused as his mom playfully adorns his face with a variety of digital stickers, including a mustache and a cowboy hat. As Gosselin, 50, scrambles to keep up with comments, he happily guides her through it. Their interaction offers a glimpse of a fresh and unseen side of their relationship.",
      "Gosselin shares 8 children with her ex-husband Jon Gosselin: 24-year-old twins Maddie and Cara, and sextuplets Aaden, Alexis, Hannah, Collin, Leah and Joel. The family appeared on TLC\u2019s \u201cJon & Kate Plus 8\u201d for 11 seasons, spanning from 2007 to 2017, but the kids largely disappeared from the public eye afterward.",
      "During her August 21 livestream, Gosselin was asked about the reality series. She said, \u201cI\u2019d love to see my reaction to our show \u2014 I\u2019d probably just cry the whole time.\u201d",

      "If anyone would know, it\u2019s Ariana Madix, who co-hosted the reunion alongside Andy Cohen. As both are no strangers to the reality TV reunion experience \u2014 Cohen, the father of reunion specials on Bravo, and Madix, a former Bravo star \u2014 it\u2019s easy to see why they were the perfect people to help the Islanders unpack the season.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 7 reunion, airing Aug. 25 at 9 p.m. ET on Peacock, Madix spoke with TODAY.com to give a peek at what viewers can expect.",
      "It\u2019s a little bit of a full circle moment, because, obviously, all the things that you just mentioned, but I feel like it was really fun because we have known each other for 10 years. And we had a really great chemistry. I feel like as the day went on, that became more and more apparent that we kind of just decided to take the bull by its horns. So as the day went on, we just really leaned into that.",
      "I think that\u2019s when we really hit our groove. And I mean, if we ever want to team up on anything ever again, I\u2019m down! Because we had a great time doing it.",
      "Everything was definitely very even. I think Andy made it clear \u2014 he was like, \"This is your show, this is not me coming in and taking over.\" And I was like, \"That\u2019s so nice of you,\" because obviously I look up to him and his interview skills for a lot of reasons.",
      "But I think there were a lot of things \u2014 when they first came to me with the idea of doing a reunion this season \u2014 that I said needed to be different. I said no one is allowed to sit behind me. \u2026 I was like, I really want to be able to send in some of my notes so that maybe at some point I can incorporate some of my own questions, which I was able to do here and there. And I think we were all in agreement that we wanted there to be less people out the entire time. So there was a structure, which I think really helped, because that was something (about) last year: I really wish that we were able to talk to them in smaller groups about specific things. And I think that that was something that \u2026 really helps to be able to have these deeper conversations that we wanted to have with them.",
      "I think they left in good spirits. There were a lot of things that I think a lot of them wanted to be able to express to each other \u2014 whether that was something that worked toward a resolution either way. Whether, like, we\u2019ll be friends now, or OK, maybe it\u2019s better off as not. I think that was important for them to be able to sit there, have that conversation and be able to move forward from there, and they all seem in great spirits.",
      "They\u2019re all so good at expressing how they feel about difficult topics. And that is something that I admire about them so much, because when I was that age, I don\u2019t think I had that. I even still struggle to have that ability. And I really look up to them in that way. I mean, I think there was a moment where Olandria and Chelley were expressing how they felt about something, and I just was in such awe of their ability to speak about their feelings so beautifully and clearly, and I struggle with that, so I always just find that very admirable.",
      "Well, in the past with \u201cVanderpump,\u201d I had seasons where I watched everything, and then there were times where I didn\u2019t. So I see both sides of watching or not watching. I think ultimately you have to do what\u2019s right for yourself. I do think that sometimes there\u2019s something that we\u2019re referencing that would be nice if everybody knew what we were talking about \u2014 but I also understand getting to a point where you\u2019re like, \"I just lived this whole thing. Do I need to relive it?\" So I definitely see both sides of that.",
      "Oh, my gosh. Well, I think they\u2019re all so different, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s so cool. Even seeing some of the things that they\u2019ve been doing since then, they all have their own niche. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so great about them. I think that they each bring something unique to the table, so I\u2019m excited to see what they do from here.",
      "I mean, I was asking Olandria if she was going to go back to elevator sales, but I think that she has a very big career in things that are definitely not elevator related. But I think it\u2019s really cool for them to be able to have this platform and realize their dreams with it. I think sometimes people online, they have a weird thing about whether they have a following or whatever. But I just think, you know, go for your dreams, and if this is the path that leads you there, then do it.",
      "It was so great for them to come to the sandwich shop! You know, that\u2019s kind of our vision for the shop when we first had the dream of opening it: Have your girls there for a little kiki, a little girls lunch. I love seeing them \u2014 watching them succeed, it just makes me so happy. And I love those girls so much, and I love seeing them just out in this world, taking it by storm. They are stars, but I feel like we knew that at the beginning. I just remember watching all of them walk into the villa that first night and knew right away they were it \u2014 they had it.",

      "Weaver is a multi-hyphenate author who believes that \u201cstories are the most positive tool for social change in the history of mankind.\u201d And with a platform that draws attention to conversations about diversity in the nerd community, initiatives that serve to promote literacy and his debut graphic novel \u201cWeirdo,\u201d he\u2019s doing just that.",
      "\u201cWhen people read \u2018Weirdo,' I want them to feel seen, nurtured and inspired. The idea is that you should open (it) and immediately go, \u2018Oh, I belong in this world. I belong with these characters. These characters are like me. These characters are like my friends,\u2019\u201d Weaver says. \"'They feel the same way that I felt.'\"",
      "'A Deep Responsibility'",
      "This section discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "\u201cWeirdo\u201d is an Eisner Award-nominated, semi-autobiographical graphic novel memoir that combines nerd culture and magical realism to tell Weaver\u2019s personal story of navigating bullying and self-doubt \"but ultimately finding light on the other side.\"",
      "Weaver, who has been open about previously attempting suicide, says he felt a \u201cdeep responsibility\u201d to help kids navigate their darkest moments when he decided to write \u201cWeirdo.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I like to say is that stories saved my life, so I like using stories to help other people,\" he says.",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 20.4% of high school students seriously considered attempting suicide, while 9.5% had attempted suicide.",
      "\u201cLooking at those staggering rates and having first-hand experience of how it feels to have to navigate those negative emotions, I felt like it was my responsibility to do something,\u201d Weaver says.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something very humbling about the idea that there\u2019s a parent who loves their child more than anything in the world, and when that child, that person that they care about more than words can describe, needs help, they reach for something that has my name on it,\u201d he adds.",
      "Weaver also believes that using a visual medium, like a graphic novel, can help readers understand feelings that they may not be able to express with words.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a moment in \u2018Weirdo\u2019 where so much is going wrong in my life that it feels like I\u2019m losing all of the color in the world around me,\" he explains. \"So visually, we demonstrate that motif by literally having the colors drain from the pages until the comic is black and white.\u201d",
      "Weaver also uses his extensive knowledge of manga and anime within the world of \u201cWeirdo.\u201d From \"Pok\u00e9mon\" to \"Ace Attorney\" and \"JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure,\" there are at least 50 references in the novel \u2014 with the first three pages having 12 alone. He calls the references the novel\u2019s \u201cstrongest advantage\u201d as it helps create a fantastical mirror of readers' own world.",
      "\u201cI want kids of a variety of fandoms to look at what we\u2019re making and say, \u2018Oh, I belong here. This guy gets it. These people understand me. I can be safe here,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "But it\u2019s not just kids who feel seen while reading Weaver\u2019s work. Though \u201cWeirdo\u201d is marketed as a middle grade novel, it has managed to strike a chord with adults as well.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege to speak to a lot of adult readers of \u2018Weirdo\u2019 and normally the story goes something like this: \u2018I got it for my son, I got it for my nephew, I got it for my niece, and I sat down and read it before I gave it to them, because I wanted to vet it. And, man, I wish I had this book when I was younger.\u2019 I think that\u2019s the highest praise that a person can receive,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think that motivates me a lot as I create. What I say is that \u2018Weirdo\u2019 is for every person on their journey to self-love. Some of us take that journey when we\u2019re kids. Others of us end up very far into adulthood before we\u2019re able to take those steps. But it\u2019s my goal that it\u2019ll be there as a support for everybody,\" he adds.",
      "In addition to being an author, Weaver is the founder and CEO of Weird Enough Productions, a media company dedicated to using anime to create positive representations of Black men and other minority groups. Through Weird Enough Productions, Weaver and his team, along with collaborators like anime distributor Crunchyroll, aim to boost reading proficiency among marginalized readers by helping them connect with characters in manga and comics.",
      "According to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 33% of 8th graders are not reading at the NAEP Basic level, meaning \"a third of 8th graders likely could not identify basic literary elements in a text.\"",
      "Literacy experts say that graphic novels can help promote reading comprehension among younger readers, as the combination of pictures and text can keep them engaged with the material. According to a survey conducted by School Library Journal in May 2023, out of the respondents, 90% of public librarians and 83% of school librarians say they suggested graphic novels to students who struggle with reading.",
      "But there is the persisting belief that graphic novels don\u2019t count as \"real reading,\" and 59% of the school librarians surveyed said they've received opposition to graphic novels from teachers, parents and more.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that if I can read a classic piece of literature, that I\u2019m smart. Whereas, if I read 1,000 chapters of \u2018One Piece\u2019 and I understand the themes and what\u2019s being communicated, that that\u2019s low brow, and that\u2019s not as important,\u201d Weaver says.",
      "\u201cThe data is very clear about what graphic novels do to positively benefit literacy and get kids reading, and I think it\u2019s a no-brainer why graphic novels are a great way to get kids excited about literacy and about storytelling,\" he adds.",
      "This back to school season, Weaver is raising money to purchase books for underresourced schools across the country. Weaver is hosting the fundraising campaign, titled Nerds for Literacy, on the Weird Enough website. After raising funds, Weaver will purchase a list of books \u2014 selected by donors, literacy education specialists and young readers \u2014 from independent bookstores and distribute them to schools.",
      "\"WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT. EVERY NERD IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE YOUTH LITERACY CRISIS?!\" states the donation page, which so far, has raised $25,000 in 48 hours.",
      "In addition to producing his own graphic novel and running Weird Enough Productions, Weaver also uses social media to discuss hard topics in the nerd community, such as racism, bullying and mental health. However, he takes a unique approach.",
      "\u201cWhen I started creating content online, one of my largest gripes was that it felt like everybody was reading off of a cue card. The information wasn\u2019t being presented in an engaging way, in a particularly intuitive way, or in an easy to understand way,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of it was super long winded. This video took 60 seconds, you could\u2019ve explained this to me in 10.\u201d",
      "With that, he decided to challenge himself. And what did he decide to do? Well, rhyme.",
      "He calls himself, \"Dr. Seuss without the racism,\" as the children's author's legacy faced a reckoning in 2021 over the racist imagery in his books. In March of that year, Dr. Seuss Enterprises stopped publishing and licensing six of his children's books and said in a statement they \"portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong.\"",
      "Weaver says he can\u2019t stop rhyming \u2014 no matter how hard he tries.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning, the idea was supposed to be, I have such mastery over the information that I\u2019m trying to present to you that I can do it in a whimsical and rhyme scheme type way, and you still understand exactly what\u2019s going on. That was my goal,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cUltimately, it reached a point where I actually can\u2019t stop rhyming,\" he adds. \"I write stuff and my brain immediately is like, \u2018Cool, so we\u2019ll rhyme it like this,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, no one said this had to rhyme. What are you doing?\u201d",
      "And yes, he did try pausing this approach as an experiment. Let\u2019s just say, people were not supportive.",
      "\u201cWe stopped rhyming for a couple of videos, and the people were like, \u2018Where are the rhymes?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe people have spoken. They want the bars.\u201d",
      "\u201cWeirdo's\" sequel is currently in the process of being illustrated and will be released in early 2027, he says. The sequel will follow Weaver and his friends (and some new faces!) and connect to the events that occur at the end of the first book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intended to grapple with some of these negative feelings that kids have around standardized tests and around the ways that institutions measure intelligence inaccurately,\" he says.",
      "While most of the experiences in \u201cWeirdo\u201d were lifted right from Weaver\u2019s life, he\u2019s having a bit more \"fun\" with its sequel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit more of a divergence between what real life Tony experienced and what\u2019s going on in the world of \u2018Weirdo,\u2019 which lets us play around a lot,\" he says.",
      "Weaver is also trying to find new ways to add more \"updated\" references, but he's admittedly finding it a bit tricky.",
      "\u201cIf you reference it in the last book, are you allowed to reference it this time?\" he poses. \"If you do reference it, do you reference it differently? How do you do it?... Are we talking about Fortnite in \u2018Weirdo 2\u2019? Are there Battle Buses? Are they dropping on Tomato Town? I don\u2019t know!\u201d",
      "While we wait for the sequel, Weaver is keeping his cards close to his chest about what is happening between now and then.",
      "\u201c\u2018Weirdo 2\u2019 is going to be exciting, but you got to keep your eyes peeled. Sequels are always cool things to continue projects, but there are other ways that projects can continue to live on, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cAdaptations are a thing, and that\u2019s all I can really say.\u201d",
      "If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988, or go to 988lifeline.org to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. You can also call the network, previously known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, at 800-273-8255 or visit SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources."

      "The film, inspired by Chinese mythology, opened in more than 2,500 American theaters on Friday. It is the latest in a wave of successful animations featuring Asian culture, such as Netflix\u2019s recent hit \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "The sequel to a hit movie released in 2019, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d tells the story of a child demigod named Ne Zha who rebels against his innate devilry and chooses to use his magical powers and martial arts skills to defend humanity from dragons and other foes.",
      "Yeoh, a Malaysian actor and fluent Mandarin speaker, said she found it hard to follow the English subtitles during some of its more spectacular scenes when she first watched the movie in Hong Kong. She left the theater thinking it needed to be dubbed in English.",
      "She later received a call asking if she wanted to voice Lady Yin, Ne Zha\u2019s mother, for an English-dubbed version being distributed by A24. The New York-based independent film company is known for productions including \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2022 film that made Yeoh the first Asian to win the Academy Award for best actress.",

      "Since its release in mainland China in January, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d has become the world\u2019s fifth-highest-grossing movie of all time, just behind James Cameron\u2019s \u201cTitanic.\u201d In February, it surpassed Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film.",
      "It is also the first non-Hollywood film to exceed $2 billion in global earnings, most of which came from the Chinese box office.",
      "The movie \u2014 which is directed by Sichuan-born Yang Yu, also known as Jiaozi \u2014 has stoked national pride in China, with the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily praising its commercial success as the \u201cfruits of a confident nation.\u201d",
      "Many schools, state-owned companies and government entities across China have actively organized group viewings of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d in celebration of what they see as a milestone in Chinese animation.",

      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",
      "Zeng said while she expects some reviews in the U.S. will criticize the film as Chinese propaganda, other viewers may just watch it out of curiosity.",
      "Kevin Ma, a veteran observer of the film industry who is based in Hong Kong, said another challenge \u201cNe Zha II\u201d faces in its latest release is the tight theatrical window in today\u2019s streaming-dominated market.",
      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

      "Famine was officially declared on Friday in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world's leading authority on hunger as Israel vowed to raze the area if Hamas doesn't agree to its terms.",
      "The declaration of famine by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes as deaths from starvation rise across the Palestinian enclave in a spiraling crisis under Israel's military assault and aid restrictions.",
      "Israel's military is preparing to push ahead with a new operation to seize Gaza City that could displace hundreds of thousands of people and worsen the dire situation there. It has launched intense strikes on the city this week after announcing it had begun the first stage of its planned assault.",
      "Famine declared",
      "The IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate \u2014 and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.",
      "The number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said \u2014 around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.",
      "\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"",
      "The United Nations-backed body had up until now only declared famine on four other occasions since it was first established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year.",
      "The report's findings were met with little surprise by global health authorities and humanitarian groups.",
      "\u201cFamine warnings have been clear for months,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,\u201d said World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cThe world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected the report's findings, calling them a \"lie,\" and repeated that \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation.\"",
      "The IPC's 59-page report does not state that Israel has a policy of starvation in Gaza.",
      "Earlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a \u201cfabricated report to fit Hamas\u2019s fake campaign.\u201d It hit out at the IPC\u2019s methods, accusing it of having \u201ctwisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria.\u201d",
      "The IPC rejected Israel\u2019s accusation.",
      "Mike Huckabee, the United States' ambassador to Israel, attacked the famine declaration before it was officially announced.",
      "\"You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilized Hamas savages,\" he said in a post on X early Friday.",
      "Famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, is classified when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two people or four children out of every 10,000 people are dying each day from starvation.",
      "But the bar can also be met if 15% of children are considered to be suffering from acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference with evidence of rapidly worsening underlying drivers, according to the IPC, which cited the latter practice in its report.",
      "The IPC said that this did not mean it had altered its threshold for famine, saying it used this method in line with established standards where a lack of other data is available, as it had also done in South Sudan.",
      "This \"does not represent a 'lowered threshold' in IPC methodology. Instead, it demonstrates the continued application of established IPC standards,\" it said.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied reports of growing starvation in Gaza, while seeking to blame any hunger in the enclave on humanitarian groups and Hamas.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza intensified after Israel launched a blockade on March 2, in the middle of its ceasefire with Hamas, barring the entry of food and other vital supplies for more than two months. It lifted the blockade in May, but only allowed a basic amount of aid in for weeks after that.",
      "Data published by COGAT states that in the weeks since Israel lifted its blockade on May 19 to August 17, when the database was last updated, 9,165 trucks carrying aid entered the enclave, with food making up just over 95% of the supplies.",
      "That boils down to an average of around 100 trucks carrying aid per day during that time period. Prior to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, around 500 trucks per day were entering the enclave, according to humanitarian groups.",
      "Israel threatens 'gates of hell'",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Friday to open the \u201cgates of hell\u201d on Gaza City until Hamas agreed to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and the militant group's complete disarmament.",
      "If not, he said, the city would \u201cbecome like Rafah and Beit Hanoun,\u201d areas that have been largely reduced to ruins under Israel\u2019s 22-month offensive.",
      "Netanyahu said a day earlier that he had authorized the operation to take over Gaza City, while also revealing he had instructed \u201cimmediate negotiations\u201d to begin for a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "The video statement followed days of silence after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by Arab mediators.",
      "The IPC\u2019s declaration comes just over three weeks after it warned that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was already unfolding in the Palestinian enclave under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions \u2014 but it had emphasized the alert was not a formal famine classification.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks there is still not enough food entering Gaza to stave off famine.",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said on Monday it had recorded three new adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decades-long conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian health ministry, with much of the territory destroyed.",
      "Among the dead are hundreds of people who have been killed while trying to seek aid following the introduction of a new distribution system led by Israel and the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation."

      "\u201cThe bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,\u201d Putin said in the letter published by North Korean state media Voice of Korea.",
      "Pyongyang and Moscow have forged increasingly close ties after the Kremlin found itself diplomatically isolated following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defense pact last year, and experts say North Korea may have sent Russia troops in exchange for advanced military technology that would aid its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Neither Russia nor North Korea confirmed the deployments until months after Pyongyang sent its first soldiers last fall. Though the two countries have not revealed the exact number of troops involved, it could be as high as 15,000, according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Of those, about 600 are believed to have been killed, South Korea\u2019s spy agency said, and thousands more injured.",
      "Though North Korea has one of the largest militaries in the world, its troops have had little real-world combat experience since the end of the Korean War in 1953. But they are strongly loyal to Kim and are trained to take their own lives rather than surrender, former North Korean soldiers who defected have told NBC News.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, there was at least one incident in which a North Korean soldier seeking to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces was killed while trying to detonate a grenade and shouting Kim\u2019s name.",
      "It is unclear how many North Korean troops remain on the frontlines. South Korean lawmakers said after an intelligence briefing in June that North Korea could deploy additional troops to Russia in July or August and that it was continuing to supply Moscow with arms."

      "Once Kyiv has more clarity about what protections its allies are willing to offer, Zelenskyy said, he would then be ready to meet with Putin. And if Putin was not ready to meet, he said, he \u201cwould like to see a strong reaction from the United States.\"",
      "Where those talks might place has emerged as a possible stumbling block.",

      "Adding to the apparent lack of urgency in talks, Russia launched a massive aerial bombardment overnight that included nearly 600 drones and 40 missiles, Ukraine's air force said early Thursday.",
      "The strikes reached deep inside Ukraine, hitting an American business in the Western region of Zakarpattia, Zelenskyy said, and injuring at least 15 employees. At least one person was killed and two other people were injured in Lviv as dozens of residential buildings were destroyed, governor Maksym Kozytskyy wrote on Telegram.",
      "Zelenskyy said on X: \"The Russians carried out this attack as if nothing has changed at all, as if there are no global efforts to stop this war. This requires a response.\"",

      "North Korea has a covert military base near the Chinese border that poses a \u201cpotential nuclear threat\u201d to the U.S. mainland, according to new research.",
      "The Sinpung-dong Missile Operating Base is about 17 miles from the border with China in the North Korean province of North Pyongan, researchers from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, said in a report Wednesday.",
      "The base could contain six to nine of North Korea\u2019s advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles, along with their mobile launchers and thousands of soldiers, the report said. Though the weapons are not likely to be mounted with nuclear warheads, they are capable of carrying them.",
      "\u201cThese missiles pose a potential nuclear threat to East Asia and the continental United States,\u201d the report said.",
      "The site, which the report said North Korea has never referred to publicly, was only recently discovered despite a strict international regime intended to limit further development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Researchers said the report was based on interviews with defectors and officials around the world, as well as declassified documents, satellite images and open-source information.",
      "The report said the weapons at the base could include North Korea\u2019s nuclear-capable Hwasong-15 or Hwasong-18 ICBMs or a missile that has yet to be revealed.",
      "\u201cCurrent assessments are that during times of crisis or war, these launchers and missiles will exit the base, meet special warhead storage/transportation units, and conduct launch operations from dispersed pre-surveyed sites.\u201d",
      "According to the latest estimate from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, North Korea has assembled about 50 nuclear warheads and has enough fissile material to produce up to 40 more.",
      "Construction of the Sinpung-dong base began around 2004, and it was \u201cgenerally complete and operational\u201d by 2014, the report said. Satellite images suggest the base continues to be developed and \u201cis active and being well-maintained by North Korean standards,\u201d it said.",
      "It is one of about 15 to 20 ballistic missile bases and related facilities across the country that North Korea has never declared, the report said.",
      "Since denuclearization talks between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un broke down in 2019, North Korea has been steadily advancing its weapons programs in defiance of international sanctions.",
      "It has also strengthened security ties with Russia, including sending arms and troops to fight in its war against Ukraine in exchange for support that experts say could include technological assistance with its weapons programs.",
      "Experts say North Korea is likely to be even more determined to pursue nuclear deterrence after U.S. strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "On Monday, Kim called for a rapid nuclear buildup amid annual U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises that Pyongyang sees as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Though Trump has expressed an interest in resuming in-person diplomacy with Kim, his regime has dismissed the idea and says the United States must accept North Korea as a nuclear power."

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israel entered the first stages of a planned assault on Gaza City on Wednesday after approving a plan to take it over that includes calling up 60,000 reservists for an expanded military operation in the besieged Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"We have begun the preliminary actions and the initial stages of the offensive on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding positions on the outskirts of Gaza City,\" Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters Wednesday.",
      "He added: \"We will intensify the strikes on Hamas in Gaza City, the political and military stronghold of the terror organization.\"",
      "Defrin also said that to \"minimize harm to civilians,\" the IDF will be warning citizens to allow them to evacuate.",
      "\"We are continuing to allow humanitarian aid for the residents of the Strip and are even expanding it \u2014 with additional central aid distribution points,\" he said.",
      "The U.S. ally appeared to be pushing ahead Wednesday with a new phase of its war despite international opposition \u2014 and in the face of a renewed push for a ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz has authorized the plans for the major new operation, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed to NBC News. It will also see an additional 20,000 reservists have their service extended, the Israeli military said.",
      "The assault is expected to force thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza to the south of the strip, which is suffering an intensifying hunger crisis under Israel\u2019s military offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, the prime minister's office said that \"ahead of approval of the plans for the operation in Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed that the timetables \u2014 for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of Hamas \u2014 be shortened.\"",
      "\"The Prime Minister expresses his great appreciation for the reservist fighters who have been mobilized and their families, and all IDF soldiers,\" the statement added. \"Together we will win.\"",
      "Hamas criticized the Israeli military's announcement and said in a statement that the Israeli government \"insists on continuing its brutal war against innocent civilians, escalating its criminal operations in Gaza City with the aim of destroying it, and displacing its residents in a full-fledged war crime.\"",
      "The United Nations also denounced the military operations Wednesday. \"Israel\u2019s reported decision to take full control of Gaza City and to forcibly displace its population will lead to mass killings of civilians and destruction of infrastructure vital to the survival of the population,\" the U.N. human rights office for the Palestinian territories said in a statement.",
      "President Donald Trump supports Israel's efforts to disarm Hamas, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "\"Israel has to make this decision and has to live with whatever decision they make. But President Trump is fully supportive of making sure that Hamas knows that from the U.S. perspective, they have to disarm, they have to give up and let all the hostages go,\" he said. \"Whether it takes 60 days or 60 minutes, that\u2019s the ultimate end result.\"",
      "Scores of people in Gaza have starved to death in recent weeks, including dozens of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave.",
      "In addition to mounting global outrage, sweeping protests have increasingly dominated Israel's streets, with growing numbers demanding an end to the offensive in the enclave.",
      "Hundreds of thousands staged furious demonstrations last weekend alongside a general strike, fueled in part by fears that the planned Gaza City assault could endanger the lives of remaining hostages.",
      "Israel also gave final approval for a widely contested settlement project in the occupied West Bank that would effectively split the territory in two. Palestinians and rights groups have warned the move could destroy plans for a future Palestinian state.",
      "Huckabee said that recent announcements by European leaders recognizing a Palestinian state would be \"counterproductive.\"",
      "\"If they believe that, unilaterally, calling for a two-state a Palestinian state recognition immediately brings them closer, the sad truth is it\u2019s taking them further away,\" he said.",
      "Ceasefire talks uncertain",
      "Katz, who replaced Yoav Gallant as defense minister last year, was  olding a discussion Tuesday to approve \"strike plans in Gaza\" with the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, and other senior defense officials, the defense ministry had said.",
      "The announcement of the expanded military operation comes after Israel appeared to shrug off news that Hamas had agreed to the latest proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would free the remaining hostages.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told NBC News on Tuesday that the deal was based on a proposal by Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages, both alive and dead, would be released with plans to negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest.",
      "\u201cThe ball is now in Israel\u2019s court,\u201d Abdelatty said, adding: \u201cWe would like a positive response from them as soon as possible in order to deal with the disastrous situation in Gaza, especially the starvation and the killing of civilians.\u201d",
      "Asked about the development, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office referred NBC News to a statement the Israeli leader made Monday suggesting he was determined to push ahead with the plan to assume full control of Gaza City and noting that Hamas appeared to be \u201cunder immense pressure.\u201d",
      "Asked if they could confirm reports that Israel would provide a response to international mediators on the proposal by Friday, the spokesperson said \u201cno\u201d and did not provide further clarification.",
      "'There is no safe place'",
      "New satellite imagery suggests that a number of people have already begun to flee the area of Gaza City in recent days ahead of Israel\u2019s advance, with the country\u2019s plan to push civilians living in the area into the enclave\u2019s south condemned by rights groups.",
      "Imagery captured on Aug. 16 shows that sites just south of Gaza City are seemingly barren, having been packed with what appear to be tent camps just days before, on Aug. 9.",
      "Mohammed Abu Sharia, a father of three, said he and his family had been forced to leave their home in Gaza City again \u2014 just months after returning from another round of displacement due to Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "\u201cThank God, we found our house almost intact and habitable, despite the theft of all its contents and the lack of doors or windows,\u201d Abu Sharia, 48, who ran an internet distribution company before Israel\u2019s assault began, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The family was able to live in their home for the past six months \u2014 but with Israel planning to take over Gaza City, they were now seeking some semblance of refuge in western Gaza.",
      "\u201cThere is no safe place, neither in the north nor the south,\u201d Abu Sharia said. \u201cMy concern is to save the family\u2019s life, as we are suffering from food shortages and the lack of any belongings with us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther displacement and an intensification in hostilities risk worsening an already catastrophic situation,\u201d the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWith more than 80 percent of Gaza already impacted by evacuation orders, it is unimaginable that civilians could be compelled to move to an even smaller area,\u201d it said.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, with much of the territory destroyed."
