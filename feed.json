      "The Sundance Film Festival kicks off Thursday in Park City, Utah, marking its final year there",
      "PARK CITY, Utah -- The Sundance Film Festival may be a little bittersweet this year. It will be familiar in some ways as it kicks off on Thursday in Park City, Utah. There will be stars, from Natalie Portman to Charli XCX, and breakout discoveries, tearjerkers, comedies, thrillers, oddities that defy categorization and maybe even a few future Oscar nominees. The pop ups and sponsors will be out in full force on Main Street. The lines to get into the 90 movies premiering across 10 days will be long and the volunteers will be endlessly helpful and cheery in subfreezing temperatures.",
      "But the country\u2019s premier showcase for independent film is also in a time of profound transition after decades of relative stability. The festival is bidding farewell to its longtime home and forging forward without its founder, Robert Redford, who died in September. Next year, it must find its footing in another mountain town, Boulder, Colorado.",
      "It\u2019s no surprise that legacy will be a through-line at this year\u2019s final edition in Park City. There will be screenings of restored Sundance gems like \u201cLittle Miss Sunshine,\u201d \u201cMysterious Skin,\u201d \u201cHouse Party\u201d and \u201cHumpday\u201d as well as Redford\u2019s first truly independent film, the 1969 sports drama \u201cDownhill Racer.\u201d Many will also pay tribute to Redford at the institute\u2019s fundraising event, where honorees include Chlo\u00e9 Zhao, Ed Harris and Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201cSundance has always been about showcasing and fostering independent movies in America. Without that, so many filmmakers wouldn\u2019t have had the careers they have,\u201d said \u201cMysterious Skin\u201d filmmaker Gregg Araki. He first attended the festival in 1992 and has been back many times, including at the labs where Zhao was one of his students.",
      "Quite a few festival veterans are planning to make the trip, including \u201cNavalny\u201d filmmaker Daniel Roher. His first Sundance in 2022 might have been a bit unconventional (made fully remote at the last minute due to the pandemic) but ended on a high note with an Oscar. This year he\u2019s back with two films, his narrative debut \u201cTuner,\u201d and the world premiere of \u201cThe AI Doc: Or How I Became an Apocaloptimist,\u201d which he co-directed with Charlie Tyrell.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going through a weird moment in the world \u2026 There\u2019s something that strikes me about an institution that has been evergreen, that seems so entrenched going through its own transition and rebirth,\u201d Roher told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019m choosing to frame this year as a celebration of Sundance and the institute and a future that will ensure the festival goes on forever and ever and ever and stays the vital conduit for so many filmmakers that it has been.\u201d",
      "Over the past four decades, countless careers have been shaped and boosted by the festival and the Institute. Three of this year\u2019s presumed Oscar nominees \u2014 Paul Thomas Anderson, Ryan Coogler and Zhao \u2014 are among those the Institute supported early in their careers.",
      "Jay Duplass, who first came to Sundance in 2003 with his brother, Mark, with what he calls a \u201c$3 film\u201d said it was the place where his career was made.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d probably be a psychologist right now if it wasn\u2019t for Sundance,\u201d Duplass said.",
      "While he\u2019s been to \u201cprobably 15 Sundances\u201d since, it hasn\u2019t lost its luster. In fact, when a programmer called him to tell him that his new film \u201cSee You When I See You\u201d was selected, he cried. The film is based on a memoir in which a young comedy writer (Cooper Raiff) attempts to process the death of his sister (Kaitlyn Dever). It's one of many films that finds humor amid grim subjects.",
      "As always, the lineup is full of starry films as well, including Cathy Yan\u2019s art world satire, \u201cThe Gallerist,\u201d starring Portman, Jenna Ortega, Sterling K. Brown, Zach Galifianakis and Da\u2019Vine Joy Randolph. The romantic drama \u201cCarousel,\u201d from Rachel Lambert, features Chris Pine and Jenny Slate as high school exes who rekindle their romance later in life. Araki is also bringing a new film, \u201cI Want Your Sex,\u201d in which Olivia Wilde plays a provocative artist (Araki described as a cross between Madonna and Robert Mapplethorpe) who takes on Cooper Hoffman as her younger muse.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a sex-positive love letter to Gen Z,\u201d Araki said. \u201cIt\u2019s a comedy. It has elements of mystery, thriller, murder \u2014 a little bit of \u2018Sunset Boulevard\u2019 \u2026 it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s colorful, it's sexy. It's a ride.\u201d",

      "The 2026 festival features a robust lineup of documentaries too, which have a good track record of snagging eventual Oscar nominations and wins. There are a handful of films about famous faces, including basketball star Brittney Griner, Courtney Love, Salman Rushdie, Billie Jean King, Nelson Mandela and comedian Maria Bamford.",

      "\u201cIt feels very special to be part of the last one in Park City,\u201d Duplass said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a super special place where, you know there are going to be movies there with giant stars and there\u2019s also going to be some kids there who made movies for a few thousand dollars. And they\u2019re all going to mix.\u201d",
      "Araki, like Redford, knew long ago that the festival had outgrown Park City. It will be strange to no longer have its iconic locations like Egyptian Theatre and Eccles and The Ray anymore, but it's also just a place.",
      "\u201cThe legacy and the tradition of Sundance will continue no matter where it is,\u201d Araki said.",

      "Prince Harry's legal battle against British tabloids has entered its final round",
      "LONDON -- The third and final round in Prince Harry 's battle with the British tabloids began Monday with his lawyer alleging that the Daily Mail and its sister Sunday newspaper engaged in a \u201cclear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering\u201d for two decades.",
      "Attorney David Sherborne said a longstanding culture of hiring private investigators who practiced \u201cdark arts\u201d to spy on celebrities for scoops had left Harry distressed and isolated.",
      "It was \u201cdisturbing to feel that my every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it,\u201d Harry said, according to his lawyer\u2019s written opening statement.",
      "The intrusions were \u201cterrifying\u201d for his loved ones, created a \u201cmassive strain\u201d on his personal relationships, and the distrust and suspicion they caused left Harry \u201cparanoid beyond belief,\u201d Sherborne said.",
      "Tens of millions of dollars are on the line in the privacy invasion case in which the Duke of Sussex is joined by Elton John, actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, and others who claim the publisher of the Mail hired private investigators to bug their cars, obtain their personal records and eavesdrop on phone calls.",
      "Associated Newspapers Ltd. has denied the allegations, called them preposterous and said the articles in question were reported with legitimate sources that included \u201cleaky\u201d associates willing to dish dirt on their famous friends.",
      "The trial in London\u2019s High Court is expected to last nine weeks and will see the return of Harry to the witness box Thursday for the second time since he made history in 2023 by becoming the first senior member of the royal family to testify in more than a century.",
      "Harry, wearing a dark blue suit, cheerfully waved at reporters as he entered the court building via a side entrance. He took a seat in the back row of the courtroom near Hurley and Frost as John watched the proceedings online.",
      "The case in the High Court follows two cases Harry brought against the other major tabloids that grew out of the widespread phone hacking scandal in which some journalists intercepted voicemail messages around the turn of this century.",
      "Harry won a court judgment in 2023 that condemned the publishers of the Daily Mirror for \u201cwidespread and habitual\u201d interception of phone messages. Last year, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s flagship U.K. tabloid made an unprecedented apology for intruding on Harry\u2019s life for years, and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit.",
      "The litigation is part of Harry's self-proclaimed mission to reform the media that he blames for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being pursued by paparazzi in Paris. He also said persistent press attacks on his wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, led them to leave royal life and move to the United States in 2020.",
      "Defense lawyer Antony White said the lawsuits were based on weak inferences by trying to connect articles to payments made to investigators.",
      "But he said witnesses, from editors to reporters who have worked for the newspapers for decades, were \u201clining up\u201d to dispute the allegations and explain their sources, which he said were often very close the subjects of the articles.",
      "\u201cThis is in reality little more than guesswork \u2014 it involves jumping to conclusions based on insufficient evidence, or worse, artificially selecting and presenting evidence to fit the preconceived agenda,\u201d White wrote in his opening statement. \u201cIt also ignores the fact that references in articles to a \u2018friend\u2019, or similar, as a source can be accurate.\u201d",

      "Sherborne said the company\u2019s vigorous denials, destruction of records and \u201cmasses upon masses of missing documents\u201d had prevented the claimants from learning what the newspapers had done.",

      "\u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d may have scored well with critics, but slightly more moviegoing audiences chose to spend the holiday weekend catching up with \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash.\u201d James Cameron\u2019s epic topped the North American box office charts for the fifth straight weekend with $13.3 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. The Walt Disney Co. also celebrated another win as their Thanksgiving release \u201cZootopia 2\u201d became the highest grossing animated Motion Picture Association release of all time.",
      "Meanwhile \u201cThe Bone Temple,\u201d directed by Nia DaCosta, landed in second place with $13 million through Sunday. By the end of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, it's expected to be at $15 million, still trailing \u201cAvatar's\u201d projected $17.2 million. The film, released by Sony Pictures and starring Ralph Fiennes and Jack O\u2019Connell, opened wide this weekend in 3,506 theaters on a wave of hype and strong reviews. It currently has a 93% on Rotten Tomatoes, and 72% of audiences said in a PostTrak poll that they would \u201cdefinitely recommend\u201d the movie.

Going into the weekend, \u201cThe Bone Temple\u201d was expected to make at least $20 million through Monday.

      "Third place went to \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d with $8.8 million in its eighth weekend. With global grosses currently at $1.7 billion, it surpassed \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the highest grossing MPA animated release of all time. The MPA distinction means that the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d which has made over $2.2 billion, is not included in the rankings. \u201cZootopia 2\u201d is also now the ninth biggest global release of all time",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d one of the other major blockbusters of late, landed in fourth place with $8.5 million. Made for only $35 million, the Lionsgate release has grossed nearly $250 million worldwide.",

      "Musicians Joan Baez and John Mayer spoke on a makeshift stage in front of the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium after four Buddhist monks opened the event with a prayer in Tibetan. Fans carried long-stemmed red roses, placing some at an altar filled with photos and candles. They wrote notes on colored paper, professing their love and thanking him for the journey.",
      "Several asked him to say hello to fellow singer and guitarist Jerry Garcia and bass guitarist Phil Lesh, also founding members who preceded him in death. Garcia died in 1995; Lesh died in 2024.",

      "The Bay Area native joined the Grateful Dead \u2014 originally the Warlocks \u2014 in 1965 in San Francisco at just 17 years old. He wrote or co-wrote and sang lead vocals on Dead classics including \u201cSugar Magnolia,\u201d \u201cOne More Saturday Night\u201d and \u201cMexicali Blues.\u201d He was generally considered less shaggy looking than the other band members, although he adopted a long beard like Garcia\u2019s later in life.",
      "The Dead played music that pulled in blues, jazz, country, folk and psychedelia in long improvisational jams. Their concerts attracted avid Deadheads who followed them on tours. The band played on decades after Garcia\u2019s death, morphing into Dead & Company with John Mayer.",
      "Darla Sagos, who caught an early flight out of Seattle Saturday morning to make the public mourning, said she suspected something was up when there were no new gigs announced after Dead & Company played three nights in San Francisco last summer. It was unusual, as his calendar often showed where he would be playing next.",

      "The Defense Department says it is revamping the military newspaper Stars and Stripes to focus on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and eliminate woke distractions",
      "The Pentagon said Thursday that it is changing the independent military newspaper Stars and Stripes so it concentrates on \u201creporting for our warfighters\u201d and no longer includes \u201cwoke distractions.\u201d",
      "That message, in a social media post from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's spokesman, is short on specifics and does not mention the news outlet's legacy of independence from government and military leadership. It comes a day after The Washington Post reported that applicants for jobs at Stars and Stripes were being asked what they would do to support President Donald Trump's policies.",
      "Stars and Stripes traces its lineage to the Civil War and has reported news about the military either in its newspaper or online steadily since World War II, largely to an audience of service members stationed overseas. Roughly half of its budget comes from the Pentagon and its staff members are considered Defense Department employees.",
      "The outlet's mission statement emphasizes that it is \u201ceditorially independent of interference from outside its own editorial chain-of-command\u201d and that it is unique among news organizations tied to the Defense Department in being \u201cgoverned by the principles of the First Amendment.\u201d",
      "Congress established that independence in the 1990s after instances of military leadership getting involved in editorial decisions. During Trump's first term in 2020, Defense Secretary Mark Esper tried to eliminate government funding for Stars and Stripes \u2014 to effectively shut it down \u2014 before he was overruled by the president.",
      "Hegseth's spokesman, Sean Parnell, said on X Thursday that the Pentagon \u201cis returning Stars and Stripes to its original mission: reporting for our warfighters.\u201d He said the department will \u201crefocus its content away from woke distractions.\u201d",
      "\u201cStars and Stripes will be custom tailored to our warfighters,\u201d Parnell wrote. \u201cIt will focus on warfighting, weapons systems, fitness, lethality, survivability and ALL THINGS MILITARY. No more repurposed DC gossip columns; no more Associated Press reprints.\u201d",
      "Parnell did not return a message seeking details. The Daily Wire reported, after speaking a Pentagon spokeswoman, that the plan is to have all Stars and Stripes content written by active-duty service members. Currently, Congress has mandated that the publication's publisher and top editor be civilians, said Max Lederer, its publisher.",

He said no one at the Pentagon has communicated to him what it wants from Stars and Stripes; he first learned of its intentions from reading Parnell's social media post.",

      "The avant-noise artist Kim Gordon debuted solo music 10 years ago",
      "NEW YORK -- Ten years ago, Kim Gordon \u2014 a revolutionary force in the alternative rock band Sonic Youth, the \u201980s New York no wave scene and the space between art and noise \u2014 debuted solo music. At the time, she was already decades into a celebrated, mixed-medium creative career.",
      "The midtempo \u201cMurdered Out\u201d was her first single, where clangorous, overdubbed guitars met the unmistakable rasp of her deadpan intonations. It was a surprise from an experimentalist well-versed in the unexpected: The song took inspiration from Los Angeles car culture, and its main collaborator was the producer Justin Raisen, then best known for his pop work with Sky Ferreira and Charli XCX. Their partnership has continued in the decade since, and on March 13, Gordon will drop her third solo album, \u201cPlay Me,\u201d announced Wednesday alongside the release of a hazy, transcendent single, \u201cNot Today.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a happy accident,\u201d she says of her continued work with Raisen. \u201cIn the beginning, I was somewhat skeptical of working with a producer and collaborator, really. But it\u2019s turned out to be incredibly freeing.\u201d",
      "\u201cPlay Me\u201d follows Gordon's critically lauded, beat-heavy 2024 album \u201cThe Collective,\u201d a noisy body of work that featured oddball trap blasts. It earned her two Grammy nominations \u2014 a career first \u2014 for alternative music album and alternative music performance. Those were for the song \u201cBye Bye,\u201d with its eerie, dissonant beat originally written for rapper Playboi Carti. For \u201cPlay Me,\u201d Gordon reimagined the track for the closer, \u201cBye Bye 25!\u201d She says it was the result of her thinking about the rap world, where revisiting and remixing is commonplace.",
      "\u201cI came up with the idea of using these words that Trump had sort of \u2018banned\u2019 in his mind,\u201d she says of the new song's lyrics. (An example: \u201cInjustice / Opportunity / Dietary guidelines / Housing for the future.\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s administration associates the terms with diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, which it has vowed to root out across the government.) For Gordon, because it became \u201cmore conceptual \u2026 the remake doesn\u2019t seem as anxiety-provoking as the original.\u201d",
      "There is a connective spirit between \u201cThe Collective\u201d and \u201cPlay Me\u201d \u2014 a shared confrontation, propulsive production and songs that possess a keen ability to process and reflect the world around Gordon. \u201cIt does feel kind of like an evolution,\u201d she says of this album next to her last. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a more focused record, and immediate.\u201d The songs are shorter and attentive.",
      "Or, to put it more simply: \u201cI like beats and that inspires me more than melodies,\u201d she says. \u201cBeats and space.\u201d",
      "That palette drives \u201cPlay Me,\u201d a foundation in which staccato lyricism transforms and offers astute criticism. Consider the title track, which challenges passive listening and the devaluation of music in the age of streaming. She names Spotify playlist titles, imagined genres defined by mood rather than music. \u201cRich popular girl / Villain mode\u201d she speak-sings, \u201cJazz and background / Chillin' after work.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's just representative of, you know, this era we're in, this culture of convenience,\u201d she says. \u201cMusic always represented a certain amount of freedom to me, and it feels like that\u2019s kind of been blanketed over.\u201d",
      "Sonically, it is a message delivered atop a '70s groove, placing it in conversation with an era unshackled from these digital technologies.",
      "The title, too, \u201cis playing off the sort of passive nature of listening to music,\u201d she says, \u201cBut also it could be seen as defiant. Like, I dare you to play me.\u201d",
      "There's also the blown-out \u201cSubcon,\u201d which examines the world's growing billionaire class and their fascination with space colonialization in a period of economic insecurity. In the song, Gordon's lyrical abstractions highlight the absurdity, taking aim at technocrats.",
      "\u201cI find reality inspirational, no matter how bad it is,\u201d she says. Where some artists might veer away from the news, Gordon tackles truth. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what music is supposed to be. So, I\u2019m just doing my version of it.\u201d",
      "In the end, she hopes listeners are \u201csomewhat thrilled by\u201d the album.",

      "\u201cLike all great films, it can\u2019t really be compared to anything else,\u201d Scorsese said. \u201cIt stands alone. It\u2019s a great American film.\u201d",

      "A Portland, Oregon, baby got sick with infant botulism after drinking contaminated ByHeart formula donated through a program that helps poor and homeless families",
      "A Portland, Oregon, boy is struggling to recover from infant botulism after drinking contaminated ByHeart baby formula donated through a program that aims to help poor and homeless families.",
      "Ashaan Carter, now 10 months old, was hospitalized twice and remains on a feeding tube after contracting the dangerous infection that has sickened more than 50 babies across the U.S.",
      "His mother, Angel Carter, said she received a can of ByHeart formula from a case worker with the Oregon Department of Human Services in early November, days before a nationwide recall of the product.",
      "Carter, who receives state food and housing assistance, said she had been exclusively breastfeeding her son, but her milk supply was waning. The case worker told the 27-year-old that the ByHeart formula \u201cwas closest to breast milk\u201d and could help, she said.",
      "\u201cI accepted it thinking, \u2018OK, I\u2019m hoping my baby can get on a bottle,'\" Carter said. \u201cIt\u2019s been all downhill since then.\u201d",
      "State officials wouldn\u2019t comment on Carter\u2019s case, but they acknowledged that the agency received ByHeart formula from PDX Diaper Bank. That was one of nearly two dozen nonprofit groups nationwide who are part of ByHeart\u2019s \u201cOpenHearted Initiative\u201d that donated formula to \u201cfamilies in need,\u201d according to the company\u2019s website.",
      "Since June 2022, nearly 24,000 cans of formula have been distributed to groups that aid homeless and other vulnerable families, the company said. All the company's products have been recalled since production began in March 2022 because of potential contamination.",
      "Soon after consuming the ByHeart formula, Ashaan developed severe constipation and muscle weakness, becoming so limp that he couldn\u2019t move his head, Carter said.",
      "After a trip to an emergency room, he was sent to Randall Children\u2019s Hospital in Portland. Doctors there diagnosed him with presumed infant botulism tied to the ByHeart formula, according to Dr. Sylvia Peterson-Perry, a family medicine doctor who delivered Ashaan and cares for him and his mother.",
      "He was treated with BabyBIG, an IV medication that provides antibodies to the infection to stop the progress of the disease.",
      "Ashaan was hospitalized for nearly two weeks in November and discharged without a feeding tube. His health rapidly declined, including dramatic weight loss, and he was hospitalized again in December. He got so sick that his mother was afraid he would die.",
      "\u201cHe was just withering away,\u201d Carter said.",

      "PDX Diaper Bank received about 400 cans of donated ByHeart formula through Baby2Baby and distributed more than 300 of them before they were recalled, Rachel Alston, the group\u2019s executive director, said in an email.",
      "\u201cAll of our partners confirmed that they took immediate action to inform families, and we offered support where we could along the way,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "Baby2Baby officials did not respond to email requests for comment. ByHeart officials said the company worked with Baby2Baby and other groups that received formula to ensure that the products were pulled and families were notified.",
      "No new cases of infant botulism tied to the outbreak have been reported since Dec. 17, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has conducted inspections at ByHeart plants, but has released no information about the source of the outbreak. Production remains shut down.",
      "Seattle food safety lawyer Bill Marler said Carter is one of more than 30 families he represents whose babies were sickened by ByHeart products. At least 18 lawsuits have been filed against ByHeart and stores that sold the contaminated formula. This week, Marler asked a federal panel to consolidate the cases in a U.S. district court in New York.",

    "story": [
      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters takes effect Saturday",
      "The world\u2019s first legally binding agreement to protect marine life in international waters took effect Saturday, marking a historic moment for ocean conservation after nearly two decades of negotiations.",
      "The High Seas Treaty will govern nearly half the planet\u2019s surface \u2013 the vast ocean areas beyond any country\u2019s control. These waters face mounting threats from destructive fishing practices, shipping, plastic pollution, overfishing and potential deep sea mining, all compounded by climate change. The ocean absorbs carbon dioxide and produces oxygen, making its health critical for addressing the climate crisis.",
      "The treaty entered into force 120 days after it reached the threshold of ratification by 60 countries in September. As of Friday, 83 countries had ratified it, including the recent addition of major maritime powers such as China and Japan.",
      "The treaty creates the first framework for establishing Marine Protected Areas on the high seas, which make up about two-thirds of the world\u2019s ocean. Currently, only around 1% of these international waters are protected.",
      "From Saturday, ratifying countries must begin working together on ocean science and technology as well as help developing nations build capacity to participate in ocean governance. Companies planning activities that could harm marine life must conduct environmental impact assessments that meet the treaty\u2019s standards. Those conducting research on ocean organisms that could be used commercially, such as for new medicines, must notify other countries and share their findings.",
      "Perhaps most significantly, countries must now promote the treaty\u2019s conservation goals when they participate in other international bodies that regulate ocean activities, such as regional fisheries organizations, the International Maritime Organization and the International Seabed Authority.",
      "While key institutions like the treaty\u2019s secretariat and scientific body are still being developed, countries can begin preparing proposals for Marine Protected Areas immediately. Potential sites include the Emperor Seamounts in the North Pacific, the Sargasso Sea in the Atlantic and the Salas y Gomez and Nazca Ridges off South America.",
      "Conservationists warn governments must act quickly to achieve the global goal of protecting 30% of the world\u2019s oceans by 2030 \u2013 a target scientists say is critical for ocean health. Because the high seas make up such a vast portion of the oceans, their protection is essential to reaching that goal.",
      "\u201cThe marine protected areas under the treaty will only be as strong as the governments make them,\u201d said Megan Randles, global political lead for Greenpeace\u2019s Ocean Campaign. \u201cWe can\u2019t trust big fishing industry players to simply stop fishing in these critical ecosystems. We need governments to use the treaty to force their hands.\u201d",
      "How those protected areas will actually be monitored and enforced is undecided. Countries are exploring various options, from satellite technology to coordinating patrols between multiple nations to using other UN agencies to help with oversight, said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance. Those details will be worked out as the first protected areas take shape.",
      "Within a year, the treaty\u2019s first Conference of Parties will meet to decide key operational details, from budgets to the makeup of various committees. Countries have been working through many of those questions at preparatory meetings, with a final session scheduled for late March. The earliest any Marine Protected Areas could actually win approval would be at the second COP, since the scientific body that will review proposals hasn\u2019t yet been established.",

    "story": [
      "Two new studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show wastewater monitoring of measles can flag measles spread days to weeks in advance",
      "Wastewater testing can alert public health officials to measles infections days to months before cases are confirmed by doctors, researchers said in two studies published Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "Colorado health officials were able to get ahead of the highly contagious virus by tracking its presence in sewer systems, researchers wrote. And Oregon researchers found wastewater could have warned them of an outbreak more than two months before the first person tested positive.",
      "The findings add to evidence that wastewater testing is a valuable weapon in tracking disease, including COVID-19, polio, mpox and bird flu.",
      "But the national wastewater surveillance system, run by CDC since 2020, is newly at risk, under a Trump administration budget plan would slash its funding from about $125 million a year to about $25 million.",
      "Peggy Honein, director of the CDC's division of infectious disease readiness and innovation, said the proposed funding level would \u201csustain some of the most critical activities\u201d but \u201cit would likely require some prioritization.\u201d",
      "The national system covers more than 1,300 wastewater treatment sites serving 147 million people. It includes six \u201ccenters for excellence\u201d \u2014 Colorado among them \u2014 that innovate and support other states in expanding their testing.",
      "The funding cut is still a proposal, and Congress has started pushing back against cuts to health care in general.",
      "But state health departments say they are preparing for a potential loss of federal support regardless. Most state programs are entirely federally funded, Honein said.",
      "Colorado started its wastewater surveillance program in 2020 with 68 utilities participating voluntarily. The program has since narrowed in its focus even as it grew to include more diseases, because it is 100% federally funded, said Allison Wheeler, manager of the Colorado\u2019s wastewater surveillance unit.",
      "The work is funded through 2029, Wheeler said, and the department is talking to state leaders about what to do after that.",
      "\u201cI know that there are other states that haven\u2019t been as fortunate as us,\u201d Wheeler said. \u201cThey need this funding in order to sustain their program for the next year.\u201d",
      "In the Colorado study, which Wheeler co-authored, officials started testing wastewater for measles in May, as outbreaks in Texas, New Mexico and Utah were growing and five cases had been confirmed in Colorado.",
      "In August, wastewater in Mesa County tested positive about a week before two measles cases were confirmed by a doctor. Neither patient knew that they had been exposed to measles. As they traced 225 household and health care contacts of the first two patients, health officials found five more cases.",

      "The researchers found that wastewater samples from the area were positive for measles about 10 weeks before the first cases were reported. The virus concentration in the wastewater over the weeks also matched the known peak of the outbreak.",
      "\u201cWe knew that we were missing cases, and I think that's always the case in measles outbreaks,\u201d said Dr. Melissa Sutton, of the Oregon Health Authority. \u201cBut this gave us an insight into how much silent transmission was occurring without us knowing about it and without our health care system knowing about it.\u201d",
      "Other states, such as Utah, have integrated wastewater data into their public-facing measles dashboards, allowing anyone to track outbreaks in real time.",
      "And in New Mexico, where 100 people got measles last year and one died, the testing helped state health officials shrink a vast rural expanse. The state's system flagged cases in northwestern Sandoval County while officials were focused on a massive outbreak 300 miles (483 kilometers) away in the southeast, said Kelley Plymesser, of the state health department.",
      "The early warning allowed the department to alert doctors and the public, lower thresholds for testing and refocus their resources. The outbreak ended in September. But because measles continues to spread across the Southwest, the state is still using the system to look for new cases.",
      "Sutton, of Oregon, said she's hopeful federal leaders will see the power of the system, its adaptability, affordability and reach.",

      "\u201cThe goal of our grants is entirely in line with the priorities listed in that letter,\u201d said Jamie Ross, CEO of the Las Vegas-based PACT Coalition, a community organization focused on substance use issues that lost funding from three grants totaling $560,000.",
      "Organizations reeling from the news on Wednesday told the AP they had already been forced to cut staff and cancel trainings. In the long term, many had been considering whether they could keep programs alive by shuffling them to different funding sources or whether they'd need to stop the services altogether.",
      "Robert Franks, CEO of the Boston-based mental health provider the Baker Center for Children and Families, which was told Tuesday it was losing two federal grants totaling $1 million, said Wednesday afternoon that the loss of funding would force his organization to lay off staff and put care in jeopardy for some 600 families receiving it.",
      "One of his organization's canceled grants had been awarded through the National Child Traumatic Stress Initiative, a more than 20-year-old program supporting specialized care for children who have been through traumatic events ranging from sexual abuse to school violence.",
      "Franks said his organization\u2019s work directly advances SAMHSA's goals to address mental illness. He said trauma care provided to children through his organization helps people from all walks of life and reduces burdens on other parts of society. He could not be reached late Wednesday to respond to the news of the grant reinstatements.",
      "Both Ross and Ryan Hampton, founder of the advocacy nonprofit Mobilize Recovery, told the AP they hadn't yet been notified of any reversal to the grant cuts they'd been notified of Tuesday night.",
      "The National Association of County Behavioral Health and Developmental Disability Directors, a group that represents local organizations that deliver safety net services, sent a letter to its members on Wednesday noting that multiple of its partners estimated the slashed grants totaled around 2,000 and likely amounted to some $2 billion. The group said the funding pullbacks appeared to focus on grants classified as Programs of Regional and National Significance.",
      "The group said it believed certain block grants, 988 suicide and crisis lifeline funding and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics were spared from the cuts.",

      "U.S. overdose deaths fell through the most of last year, suggesting a lasting improvement in an epidemic that had been worsening for decades",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. overdose deaths fell through most of last year, suggesting a lasting improvement in an epidemic that had been worsening for decades.",
      "Federal data released Wednesday showed that overdose deaths have been falling for more than two years \u2014 the longest drop in decades \u2014 but also that the decline was slowing.",
      "And the monthly death toll is still not back to what it was before the COVID-19 pandemic, let alone where it was before the current overdose epidemic struck decades ago, said Brandon Marshall, a Brown University researcher who studies overdose trends.",
      "\u201cOverall I think this continues to be encouraging, especially since we're seeing declines almost across the nation,\u201d he said.",
      "Overdose deaths began steadily climbing in the 1990s with overdoses involving opioid painkillers, followed by waves of deaths from heroin and \u2014 more recently \u2014 illicit fentanyl. Deaths peaked nearly 110,000 in 2022, fell a little in 2023 and then plummeted 27% in 2024, to around 80,000. That was the largest one-year decline ever recorded.",
      "The new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data runs through August 2025 and represents the first update of monthly provisional drug overdose deaths since the federal government shutdown.",
      "An estimated 73,000 people died from overdoses in the 12-month period that ended August 2025, down about 21% from the 92,000 in the previous 12-month period.",
      "CDC officials reported that deaths were down in all states except Arizona, Hawaii, Kansas, New Mexico and North Dakota. But they noted it's likely that not all overdose deaths have been reported yet in every state, and additional data in the future might affect that state count.",
      "Researchers cannot yet say with confidence why deaths have gone down. Experts have offered multiple possible explanations: increased availability of the overdose-reversing drug naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, shifts in how people use drugs, and the growing impact of billions of dollars in opioid lawsuit settlement money.",
      "Some also point to research that suggests the number of people likely to overdose has been shrinking, as fewer teens take up drugs and many illicit drug users have died.",
      "Two other theories recently joined the list.",
      "In a paper published last week in the journal Science, University of Maryland researchers point to the drug supply. They say regulatory changes in China a few years ago appear to have diminished the availability of precursor chemicals used to make fentanyl.",
      "Their argument is based partly on information from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which last year reported that the purity \u2014 and dangerous potency \u2014 of fentanyl rose early in the COVID-19 pandemic but fell after 2022. It suggests it became harder to make fentanyl and its potency was diluted.",
      "One piece of evidence for that: More U.S.-based Reddit users reported a fentanyl \u201cdrought\u201d in 2023.",

Information is limited on exactly what the Chinese government did, and the paper is a bit speculative, but \u201cwe thought we could make a case,\u201d said Peter Reuter, one of the authors.",
      "The recent deceleration of overdose deaths could be because producers in Canada and Mexico found alternative sources, Reuter and his colleagues think.",
      "Their paper drew inspiration from a team of University of Pittsburgh researchers, who earlier concluded that regulatory changes in China concerning the drug carfentanil were an important explanation for a dip in U.S. overdose deaths in 2018.",
      "Those same Pittsburgh researchers \u2014 Dr. Donald Burke and Dr. Hawre Jalal \u2014 are now focused on another theory for what's happened to overdose deaths. In a paper published last week in the International Journal of Drug Policy, they say overdose trends may be at least partly tied to federal stimulus checks sent out during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "The researchers tracked the three rounds of pandemic stimulus payments to U.S. households in 2020 and 2021, and saw surges in overdose deaths after each one.",
      "That money alleviated economic hardship for many families, but some of it also helped people pay for illicit drugs, the Pittsburgh researchers say. And the end of those payments helps explain why overdoses stabilized in 2022 and began falling afterward, they say.",
      "Both arguments seem to have merit, though they do not prove causation, said Dr. Daniel Ciccarone, a drug policy expert at the University of California, San Francisco.",

      "They also noted Trump has promised a $2,000 check to Americans to help offset the rising prices resulting from tariffs placed on China. Those checks could cause some drug users to splurge and overdose, said Burke, who urged federal officials to think through how the money is disbursed.",

      "Marine Le Pen's political future is uncertain as she faces an appeals trial in Paris",
      "PARIS -- French far-right leader Marine Le Pen\u2019s political future hangs in the balance at an appeals trial in Paris, which may damage her party\u2019s ambitions of radically changing France\u2019s direction through anti-immigration and nationalist policies.",
      "Le Pen will answer the judges' questions for two days starting Tuesday as she seeks to overturn a March ruling that found her guilty of misusing European Parliament funds in the hiring of aides from 2004 to 2016.",
      "She was given a five-year ban from holding elected office, two years of house arrest with an electronic bracelet and a further two-year suspended sentence.",
      "Here's why the appeals trial could significantly impact France's political landscape:",
      "If she\u2019s able to run, Le Pen, 57, is expected to be among top contenders in the 2027 presidential election, possibly the front-runner, according to opinion polls.",
      "She finished runner-up to Emmanuel Macron in 2017 and 2022, making her one of the most experienced senior politicians in the country.",
      "Le Pen has been for the past 15 years trying to bring the far right into France\u2019s political mainstream, striving to remove the stigma of racism and antisemitism that has clung to the party.",
      "Her National Rally party has become since 2024 the largest single political group in France\u2019s powerful lower house of parliament, even though it fell short of having a majority of seats.",
      "If Le Pen is ruled ineligible, she has already designated her 30-year-old prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Jordan Bardella, as her successor in the presidential bid.",
      "The National Rally and 11 of its officials, including Le Pen, are accused of having used money intended for European Union parliamentary aides to pay instead staff who worked for the party between 2004 and 2016, in violation of the 27-nation bloc\u2019s regulations.",
      "Some EU money was used to pay for Le Pen\u2019s bodyguard, as well as her personal assistant. Another aide worked as a graphic designer. Others worked as aides to party officials they had no employment contract with.",
      "Le Pen\u2019s sister, Yann, also was paid as an EU parliamentary aide when she was in charge of organizing the party\u2019s big events.",
      "The legal proceedings stem from a 2015 alert raised to French authorities about possible fraud by Martin Schulz, then-president of the European Parliament.",
      "Le Pen and other party officials acknowledged they hired people to do multiple tasks for the party but denied wrongdoing.",
      "During the first trial in 2024, Le Pen argued all the work done by aides was justified and aboveboard. She said their missions had to be adapted to the lawmakers' various activities primarily focusing on the domestic scene, which explains they had diverse tasks. She also acknowledged some of the aides were \u201cshared\u201d by several elected officials for organization purposes.",
      "The role of an aide \u201cdepends on each person\u2019s skills. Some wrote speeches for me, and some handled logistics and coordination,\u201d Le Pen said at the time.",

      "A Paris court ruled in March that Le Pen was at the heart of \u201ca fraudulent system\u201d that her party used to siphon off EU parliament funds worth 2.9 million euros ($3.4 million). The ruling described the embezzlement as \u201ca democratic bypass\u201d unfair to competitors.",
      "The court noted \u201cthe seriousness of the acts committed\u201d and \u201cthe harm caused both to citizens\u2019 trust in public life and to the interests of the European Parliament\u201d to justify the sentence.",
      "The judges handed down guilty verdicts to eight other current or former members of her party who, like Le Pen, previously served as European Parliament lawmakers. Also convicted were 12 people who served as parliamentary aides and three others. Some did not appeal the ruling.",
      "The five-week trial that started on Jan. 13 will reexamine the case from scratch, reassessing evidence and hearing witnesses and defendants again. A new ruling will be issued at a later date, likely before summer.",
      "Several scenarios are possible.",

      "Bardella\u2019s popularity has surged in recent years, particularly among younger voters, though some within the party have questioned his leadership. His relative inexperience compared with Le Pen, scripted responses during interviews and apparent lack of expertise on some economic and international topics may work against a potential presidential candidate.",
      "Another option is for Le Pen to be found guilty, but with a lighter sentence that still allows her to run.",
      "Le Pen denounced the March ruling as \u201ca democratic scandal.\u201d",

      "In France, judges are independent magistrates and cannot be removed from their posts.",

      "GUATEMALA CITY -- The death toll from suspected gangsters\u2019 attacks on Guatemalan police rose to 10 on Monday, as Guatemalans saw heavier security in the streets and curtailed rights after Congress approved President Bernardo Ar\u00e9valo's emergency declaration.",
      "The violence started Saturday when inmates seized control of three prisons in apparently coordinated riots, taking 43 guards hostage. The gangs were demanding privileges for their members and leaders, according to authorities. Shortly after police liberated one prison Sunday morning, suspected gang members attacked police across the capital.",
      "Officials said late Monday a tenth police officer died following the attacks.",
      "Police honored the fallen officers in a ceremony Monday, where flag-draped coffins sat in the Interior Ministry.",
      "\u201cToday it pains me to give each one of the families this flag, symbol of the nation that will not forget the sacrifice and commitment of their police fallen in the fulfillment of their duty,\u201d Ar\u00e9valo said Monday.",
      "Outside the Interior Ministry, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Revolorio, 72, father of officer Jos\u00e9 Efra\u00edn Revolorio Barrera, 25, said, \u201cI hope that the criminals who did this to my son will one day pay for it, that the law will go after them. And that this doesn\u2019t end here, because my son was an honest man, competent at his work.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the government gazette published Monday Ar\u00e9valo\u2019s declaration of a 30-day state of emergency, saying there were \u201ccoordinated actions by self-named maras or gangs against state security forces, including armed attacks against civilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Among the rights that the declaration limits are freedom of action and demonstrations. It also allows police to arrest people without a judicial order if they are suspected gang members. Security forces could also prohibit the movement of vehicles in certain places or subject them to searches.",
      "The unicameral Congress approved the state of emergency with minor changes Monday night on a vote of 149 in favor to 1 against, with 10 absent or on approved leave of absence. However, it had gone into effect Sunday.",

It affects people psychologically: they don't want to go out,\u201d said \u00d3scar L\u00f3pez, a 68-year-old radio technician who had a doctor's appointment. \u201cI agree with the president imposing the state of emergency because it doesn't stop the violence, but it relaxes people.\u201d",

      "Iranians have been struggling with a near-total internet blackout for nearly two weeks",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iranians have been struggling for nearly two weeks with the longest, most comprehensive internet shutdown in the history of the Islamic Republic \u2014 one that has not only restricted their access to information and the outside world, but is also throttling many businesses that rely on online advertising.",
      "Authorities shut down internet access on Jan. 8 as nationwide protests led to a brutal crackdown that activists say has killed over 4,000 people, with more feared dead. Since then, there has been minimal access to the outside world, with connectivity in recent days restored only for some domestic websites. Google also began partially functioning as a search engine, with most search results inaccessible.",
      "Officials have offered no firm timeline for the internet to return, leading to fears by businesses across the country about their future.",
      "One pet shop owner in Tehran, who spoke on the condition of anonymity like others for fear of reprisals, said his business had fallen by 90% since the protests. \u201cBefore that, I mainly worked on Instagram and Telegram which I don\u2019t have access to anymore. The government has proposed two domestic alternatives. The point is our customers are not there \u2014 they don\u2019t use it.\u201d",
      "The internet outage compounds economic pain already suffered by Iranians. The protests, which appear to have halted under a bloody suppression by authorities, began Dec. 28 over Iran\u2019s rial currency falling to over 1.4 million to $1. Ten years ago, the rial traded at 32,000 to $1. Before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, it traded at 70 to $1.",
      "The currency\u2019s downward spiral pushed up inflation, increasing the cost of food and other daily necessities. The pressure on Iranians\u2019 pockets was compounded by changes to gasoline prices that were also introduced in December, further fueling anger.",
      "Iran\u2019s state-run news agency IRNA quoted a deputy minister of communications and information technology, Ehsan Chitsaz, as saying the cut to the internet cost Iran between $2.8 to $4.3 million each day.",
      "But the true cost for the Iranian economy could be far higher. The internet monitoring organization NetBlocks estimates each day of an internet shutdown in Iran costs the country over $37 million.",
      "The site says it estimates the economic impact of internet outages based on indicators from multiple sources including the World Bank and the International Telecommunication Union, which is the United Nations\u2019 specialized agency for digital technology.",
      "In 2021 alone, a government estimate suggested Iranian businesses made as much as $833 million a year in sales from social media sites, wrote Dara Conduit, a lecturer at the University of Melbourne in Australia, in an article published by the journal Democratization in June. She cited a separate estimate suggesting internet disruptions around the 2022 Mahsa Amini protests cost the Iranian economy $1.6 billion.",
      "The 2022 internet disruptions' \"far-reaching and blanket economic consequences risked further heightening tensions in Iran and spurring the mobilization of new anti-regime cohorts onto the streets at a time when the regime was already facing one of the most serious existential threats of its lifetime,\u201d Conduit wrote.",

      "On the anniversary of his inauguration, President Donald Trump is heading to the World Economic Forum in Davos, an annual gathering of the global elite",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump plans to use a key address Wednesday to try to convince Americans he can make housing more affordable, but he's picked a strange backdrop for the speech: a Swiss mountain town where ski chalets for vacations cost a cool $4.4 million.",
      "On the anniversary of his inauguration, Trump is flying to the World Economic Forum in Davos \u2014 an annual gathering of the global elite \u2014 where he may see many of the billionaires he has surrounded himself with during his first year back in the White House.",
      "Trump had campaigned on lowering the cost of living, painting himself as a populist while serving fries at a McDonald's drive-thru. But in office, his public schedules suggest he's traded the Golden Arches for a gilded age, devoting more time to cavorting with the wealthy than talking directly to his working-class base.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s the investors and billionaires at Davos who have his attention, not the families struggling to afford their bills,\u201d said Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal think tank.",
      "Trump's attention in his first year back has been less on pocketbook issues and more fixed on foreign policy with conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and Venezuela. He is now bent on acquiring Greenland to the chagrin of European allies \u2014 a headline likely to dominate his time in Davos, overshadowing his housing ideas.",
      "Trump noted the Europeans' resistance, telling reporters Monday night, \"Let\u2019s put it this way: It\u2019s going to be a very interesting Davos.\u201d",
      "The White House has tried to shift Trump's focus to affordability issues, a response to warning signs in the polls in a year where control of Congress is at stake in midterm elections.",
      "About six in 10 U.S. adults now say that Trump has hurt the cost of living, according to the latest survey by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. It's an issue even among Republicans, who have said Trump's work on the economy hasn't lived up to their expectations. Only 16% say Trump has helped \u201ca lot\u201d on making things more affordable, down from 49% in April 2024, when an AP-NORC poll asked Americans the same question about his first term.",
      "The president is banking on investment commitments from billionaires and foreign nations to create a jobs boom, even as his broad tariffs have crimped the labor market and spurred inflation. Trump supporters who attend his rallies \u2014 which the president resumed last month \u2014 are left to trust that Trump\u2019s business ties can eventually help them.",
      "This strategy carries political risks. Voters are more interested in the economy they\u2019re experiencing in their own lives than in Trump\u2019s relationships with billionaires, said Frank Luntz, the Republican-affiliated pollster and strategist.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re asking me, \u2018Are billionaires popular?\u2019 The answer is no \u2014 and they\u2019ve haven\u2019t been for some time,\u201d said Luntz, who last year identified \u201caffordability\u201d as a defining issue for voters.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s first term in 2017, the wealthiest 0.1% of Americans have seen their wealth increase by $11.98 trillion to $23.46 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.",
      "The magnitude of those gains dwarfs what the bottom 50% of households \u2014 the majority of the country \u2014 received during the same period. Their net worth rose by $2.94 trillion, roughly one-fourth what the top 0.1% got.",
      "One of the biggest concerns for voters is the cost of housing. In recent weeks, Trump has floated proposals like reducing interest rates on home loans by buying $200 billion in mortgage debt and banning large financial companies from buying homes. Yet those efforts would do little to address the core problem in the housing market: a multi-year shortfall in home construction and home prices that have generally risen faster than wages.",

But a Congressional Budget Office analysis indicated that middle-class families may only see savings of $800 to $1,200 a year, on average, while the top 10% of earners would receive $13,600. A separate analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a think tank, said those earning above $1 million would save on average $66,510 this year.",

      "The White House said the previous Biden administration had alienated the business community to the detriment of the economy. \u201cPresident Trump\u2019s pro-growth policies and friendly relationships with industry titans, on the other hand, are securing trillions in investments that are creating jobs and opportunities for everyday Americans,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said.",
      "Last month, Trump celebrated a charitable contribution of $6.25 billion to the \u201cTrump\u201d investment accounts for children by Michael Dell. It was a chance to talk about economic inequality \u2014 but also another opportunity for Trump to showcase his relationship with billionaires.",
      "Trump takes phone calls from billionaires and CEOs to chat about business, politics and interests such as his planned White House ballroom. He regularly peppers his speeches with shoutouts to Nvidia founder Jensen Huang, whose net worth was estimated by Forbes at roughly $162 billion as of Sunday.",
      "He\u2019s installed billionaires in his inner circle such as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick (net worth: $3.3 billion) and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff (net worth: $2 billion). He put Elon Musk (net worth: $780 billion) in charge of slashing government payrolls before a dramatic falling-out and, later, a public reconciliation.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt at a briefing last month portrayed Trump\u2019s own status as a billionaire as a positive for him with voters.",

      "The hacking comes as the death toll in a crackdown by authorities that smothered the demonstrations reached at least 4,029 people, activists said. They fear the number will grow far higher as information leaks out of a country still gripped by the government's decision to shut down the internet. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had his invitation to speak at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, withdrawn over the killings.",
      "Meanwhile, tensions remain high between the United States and Iran over the crackdown after President Donald Trump drew two red lines for the Islamic Republic \u2014 the killing of peaceful protesters and Tehran conducting mass executions in the wake of the demonstrations. A U.S. aircraft carrier, which days earlier had been in the South China Sea, passed Singapore overnight to enter the Strait of Malacca \u2014 putting it on a route that could bring it to the Middle East.",
      "The footage aired Sunday night across multiple channels broadcast by satellite from Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting, the country's state broadcaster. The video aired two clips of exiled Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi, then included footage of security forces and others in what appeared to be Iranian police uniforms. It claimed without offering evidence others had \u201claid down their weapons and swore an oath of allegiance to the people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a message to the army and security forces,\u201d one graphic read. \u201cDon't point your weapons at the people. Join the nation for the freedom of Iran.\u201d",

      "A statement from Pahlavi's office acknowledged the disruption that showed the crown prince. It did not respond to questions from The Associated Press about the hack. How much support Pahlavi has inside of Iran remains an open question, though there have been pro-shah cries at the demonstrations and at night since the crackdown.",
      "Sunday's hack isn't the first to see Iranian airwaves disrupted. In 1986, The Washington Post reported that the CIA supplied the prince\u2019s allies \u201ca miniaturized television transmitter for an 11-minute clandestine broadcast\u201d to Iran by Pahlavi that pirated the signal of two stations in the Islamic Republic.",

Petersen Jr., the USS Michael Murphy and the USS Spruance, all Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers, were traveling with the Lincoln through the strait.",
      "Multiple U.S. media reports quoting anonymous officials have said the Lincoln, which has its homeport in San Diego, was on its way to the Mideast. It likely would still need several days of travel before its aircraft would be in range of the region. The Mideast has been without an aircraft carrier group or an amphibious ready group, likely complicating any discussion of a military operation targeting Iran given Gulf Arab states' broad opposition to such an attack.",

      "Mark Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur and Hoosiers alum, understands the significance of Indiana football's rise",
      "MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- Mark Cuban understands what this moment means for Indiana football, probably more than most.",
      "Cuban, the billionaire entrepreneur, is a minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks. He knows what winning looks like. Knows what \u2014 and how long \u2014 it takes to build a successful program. As an Indiana alum \u2014 he graduated from the business school in 1981 \u2014 he also has watched its rapid rise from one of the most unsuccessful programs in college football history to the brink of a national title.",
      "Cuban has poured millions into his alma mater over the years, long before Curt Cignetti took over the football team in 2024 and made it a national contender, including a $5 million donation in 2015 for a sports media center. Recently, Cuban has become a significant donor for the football program and earlier this year told Front Office Sports he has donated more money for the current transfer cycle.",
      "Those donations were intended to help build the Hoosiers into a title contender, but even Cuban couldn't foresee a rise this dramatic. Indiana will enter Monday's College Football Playoff championship against Miami as the No. 1 team in the country looking to build on its best season in program history.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve literally had Centenarians tell me how unimaginable this has been,\u201d Cuban said via email. \u201cPlayers on the '68 Rose Bowl team tell me the same thing. It\u2019s just all unreal.\u201d",
      "At a time in college football when name, image and likeness and the transfer portal dominate the landscape, Cuban's support for the Hoosiers shows how the right financial backing \u2014 and an institution's ability to attract the right celebrities and deep-pocketed alumni \u2014 can help alter a program's trajectory.",
      "\u201cIt takes a village. It takes money,\u201d Cignetti said Saturday. \"But it\u2019s not all about money. We\u2019ve got a lot of alums, a lot of rich alums. Mark Cuban is a very visible guy. ... We kind of hit it off right off the bat. He\u2019s got instant recognition, which only helps.\u201d",
      "Cuban has voiced his support for the team over the years and watched up close at the Peach Bowl when Indiana dominated Oregon to punch its ticket to the national championship. He has enjoyed the up-close ride but made it clear that simply getting to the title game isn't the goal.",
      "\u201cAn appearance is fun. It\u2019s been an amazing run,\u201d Cuban said. \u201cAs someone who has lost (two) NBA Finals and won one, I can tell you losing hurts a lot more than winning is fun.\u201d",
      "The Hoosiers haven't given any indication they're done winning, though.",
      "They're 26-2 since Cignetti took over and have gone 15-0 this year, earning their first No. 1 ranking in school history. Last month they won their first Big Ten title in nearly half a century. They've beaten Alabama (38-3) and Oregon (56-22) in the CFP by an average of 34.5 points.",

      "The legislative vote took place weeks after a deadly military takeover attempting to overthrow President Patrice Talon, which lasted a few hours before authorities announced it had been foiled. It was the latest in a series of recent coups across Africa \u2014 most following a similar pattern of disputed elections, constitutional upheaval, security crises and youth discontent.",
      "Out of the five parties running in the Benin election, only the Republican Bloc and the Progressive Union for Renewal, both aligned with the president, won seats in the assembly, according to the provisional results announced Saturday evening. The Republican Bloc will have 49 lawmakers, and there will be 60 for the Progressive Union for Renewal.",
      "According to the new electoral code, a party must obtain 20% of the national vote and 20% in each of the 24 electoral districts to be eligible for seat allocation.",

      "Despite a history of coups following its independence from France in 1960, Benin has enjoyed relative calm in the past two decades. The country is set to elect a new president in April, and Talon, 67 is barred from running after a decade in office. His close ally, Finance Minister Romuald Wadagni, is seen as the front-runner to replace him, as the main opposition candidate was barred from running, for failing to meet the required endorsements.",
      "Under Talon's tenure, Benin experienced a period of economic growth, but critics accuse him of clamping down on political opposition and human rights.",

The SDF appeared to have largely retreated after initial clashes on a tense front line area in eastern Aleppo province.",
      "Hours after the government announced the deal, SDF leader Mazloum Abdi confirmed it in a video statement, saying the group had accepted the agreement, which stipulates their withdrawal from Raqqa and Deir el-Zour provinces \u201cto stop the bloodshed.\u201d",

Abdi, who was scheduled to meet with the president in Damascus was not seen, though his signature appeared on the document. Al-Sharaa told journalists that Abdi could not travel due to bad weather and will visit Damascus on Monday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a victory for all Syrians of all backgrounds,\u201d al-Sharaa told journalists in Damascus after signing the agreement. \u201cHopefully Syria will end its state of division and move to a state of unity and progress.\u201d",
      "The two warring sides are key allies of Washington. U.S. Envoy Tom Barrack met with al-Sharaa earlier Sunday as government forces were sweeping into the city of Raqqa and across Deir el-Zour province. Abdi reportedly joined the meeting over the phone.",

      "\u201cThis agreement and ceasefire represent a pivotal inflection point, where former adversaries embrace partnership over division,\u201d said Barrack in a post on X.",

      "The SDF would have to give up the Raqqa and Deir el-Zour provinces \u2014 both Arab-majority areas \u2014 to the Syrian military and government, as well as its border crossings and oil and gas fields. Hassakah Province, the heartland of the Kurdish population, is only expected to give its civilian administration back to Damascus, while the Kurdish-led agencies that handled prisons and sprawling camps with thousands of detained Islamic State group fighters and families would be handed over to Damascus.",
      "There was no clear timeline on when and how the different elements of the agreement will take effect. Al-Sharaa told journalists that it will be gradually implemented, beginning with the cessation of hostilities.",
      "It appeared that tensions following clashes in Aleppo earlier this month had calmed after Abdi announced that his troops will withdraw east of the Euphrates River, and al-Sharaa issued a presidential decree that would strengthen Kurdish rights in the country.",

    "story": [
      "A new study finds that warming temperatures are causing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier, threatening some species with extinction by century's end",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Warming temperatures are forcing Antarctic penguins to breed earlier and that's a big problem for two of the cute tuxedoed species that face extinction by the end of the century, a study said.",
      "With temperatures in the breeding ground increasing 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (3 degrees Celsius) from 2012 to 2022, three different penguin species are beginning their reproductive process about two weeks earlier than the decade before, according to a study in Tuesday's Journal of Animal Ecology. And that sets up potential food problems for young chicks.",
      "\u201cPenguins are changing the time at which they\u2019re breeding at a record speed, faster than any other vertebrate,\u201d said lead author Ignacio Juarez Martinez, a biologist at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. \"And this is important because the time at which you breed needs to coincide with the time with most resources in the environment and this is mostly food for your chicks so they have enough to grow.''",
      "For some perspective, scientists have studied changes in the life cycle of great tits, a European bird. They found a similar two-week change, but that took 75 years as opposed to just 10 years for these three penguin species, said study co-author Fiona Suttle, another Oxford biologist.",
      "Researchers used remote control cameras to photograph penguins breeding in dozens of colonies from 2011 to 2021. They say it was the fastest shift in timing of life cycles for any backboned animals that they have seen. The three species are all brush-tailed, so named because their tails drag on the ice: the cartoon-eye Adelie, the black-striped chinstrap and the fast-swimming gentoo.",
      "Suttle said climate change is creating winners and losers among these three penguin species and it happens at a time in the penguin life cycle where food and the competition for it are critical in survival.",
      "The Adelie and chinstrap penguins are specialists, eating mainly krill. The gentoo have a more varied diet. They used to breed at different times, so there were no overlaps and no competition. But the gentoos' breeding has moved earlier faster than the other two species and now there's overlap. That's a problem because gentoos, which don't migrate as far as the other two species, are more aggressive in finding food and establishing nesting areas, Martinez and Suttle said.",
      "Suttle said she has gone back in October and November to the same colony areas where she used to see Adelies in previous years only to find their nests replaced by gentoos. And the data backs up the changes her eyes saw, she said.",
      "\u201cChinstraps are declining globally,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cModels show that they might get extinct before the end of the century at this rate. Adelies are doing very poorly in the Antarctic Peninsula and it\u2019s very likely that they go extinct from the Antarctic Peninsula before the end of the century.\u201d",
      "Martinez theorized that the warming western Antarctic \u2014 the second-fasting heating place on Earth behind only the Arctic North Atlantic \u2014 means less sea ice. Less sea ice means more spores coming out earlier in the Antarctic spring and then \u201cyou have this incredible bloom of phytoplankton,\u201d which is the basis of the food chain that eventually leads to penguins, he said. And it's happening earlier each year.",
      "Not only do the chinstraps and Adelies have more competition for food from gentoos because of the warming and changes in plankton and krill, but the changes have brought more commercial fishing that comes earlier and that further shortens the supply for the penguins, Suttle said.",

She was not part of the Oxford study.",
      "With millions of photos \u2014 taken every hour by 77 cameras for 10 years \u2014 scientists enlisted everyday people to help tag breeding activity using the Penguin Watch website.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had over 9 million of our images annotated via Penguin Watch,\u201d Suttle said. \u201cA lot of that does come down to the fact that people just love penguins so much. They\u2019re very cute. They\u2019re on all the Christmas cards. People say, \u2018Oh, they look like little waiters in tuxedos.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Adelies, I think their personality goes along with it as well,\u201d Suttle said, saying there's \u201cperhaps a kind of cheekiness about them \u2014 and this very cartoon-like eye that does look like it\u2019s just been drawn on.\u201d",

      "Also among the streaming offerings worth your time this week, as selected by The Associated Press\u2019 entertainment journalists: Ryan Murphy's new series \u201cThe Beauty\u201d tackles beauty standards with some horror mixed in, Jeremy Allen White plays The Boss in \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\u201d and Megadeth going out with a bang with their final, self-titled album.",
      "\u2014 Dwayne Johnson transformed into MMA pioneer Mark Kerr for \u201cThe Smashing Machine,\u201d a surprisingly gentle drama about winning, addiction and self-worth, which is set to debut on HBO Max on Friday, Jan. 23. In his review, Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle wrote that the potency of Johnson\u2019s performance is \u201clet down by a movie that fails to really grapple with the violent world around Mark, resorting instead for a blander appreciation of these MMA combatants. What does resonate, though, is the portrait of a human colossus who learns to accept defeat.\u201d Filmmaker Benny Safdie won a directing prize for his efforts at the Venice Film Festival, though the awards season spotlight has shifted to his brother, Josh, who made \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d",

      "\u2014 The Bruce Springsteen biopic \u201cSpringsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere\u201d is also making its streaming debut on Hulu and Disney+ on Friday, Jan. 23. Written and directed by Scott Cooper, the film stars Jeremy Allen White as The Boss during the making of the soulful \u201cNebraska\u201d album. In his review for the AP, Mark Kennedy called it \u201can endearing, humbling portrait of an icon,\u201d adding that it is almost a mirror of the album itself, \u201cunexpected, complicated and very American gothic.\u201d",
      "\u2014 A few other film festival gems are coming to more niche streamers too. The documentary \u201cMr. Nobody Against Putin,\u201d a 2025 Sundance selection about a Russian teacher who secretly documents his classroom\u2019s transformation into a military recruitment center during the invasion of Ukraine, is streaming on KINO Film on Thursday.

      "A woman in Canada has become a global symbol of defiance against Iran's regime",
      "LONDON -- With one puff of a cigarette, a woman in Canada became a global symbol of defiance against Iran's bloody crackdown on dissent \u2014 and the world saw the flame.",
      "A video that has gone viral in recent days shows the woman \u2014 who described herself as an Iranian refugee \u2014 snapping open a lighter and setting the flame to a photo she holds. It ignites, illuminating the visage of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's highest cleric. Then the woman dips a cigarette into the glow, takes a quick drag \u2014 and lets what remains of the image fall to the pavement.",
      "Whether staged or a spontaneous act of defiance \u2014 and there\u2019s plenty of debate \u2014 the video has become one of the defining images of the protests in Iran against the Islamic Republic\u2019s ailing economy, as U.S. President Donald Trump considers military action in the country again.",
      "The gesture has jumped from the virtual world to the real one, with opponents of the regime lighting cigarettes on photos of the ayatollah from Israel to Germany and Switzerland to the United States.",
      "In the 34 seconds of footage, many across platforms like X, Instagram and Reddit saw one person defy a series of the theocracy\u2019s laws and norms in a riveting act of autonomy. She wears no hijab, three years after the \u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d protests against the regime\u2019s required headscarves.",
      "She burns an image of Iran\u2019s supreme leader, a crime in the Islamic republic punishable by death. Her curly hair cascades \u2014 yet another transgression in the Iranian government\u2019s eyes. She lights a cigarette from the flame \u2014 a gesture considered immodest in Iran.",
      "And in those few seconds, circulated and amplified a million times over, she steps into history.",
      "In 2026, social media is a central battleground for narrative control over conflicts. Protesters in Iran say the unrest is a demonstration against the regime\u2019s strictures and competence. Iran has long cast it as a plot by outsiders like United States and Israel to destabilize the Islamic Republic.",
      "And both sides are racing to tell the story of it that will endure.",
      "Iranian state media announces wave after wave of arrests by authorities, targeting those it calls \u201cterrorists\u201d and also apparently looking for Starlink satellite internet dishes, the only way to get videos and images out to the internet. There was evidence on Thursday that the regime\u2019s bloody crackdown had somewhat smothered the dissent after activists said it had killed at least 2,615 people. That figure dwarfs the death toll from any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the mayhem of the country\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "Social media has bloomed with photos of people lighting cigarettes from photos of Iran\u2019s leader. \u201cSmoke \u2019em if you got \u2019em. #Iran,\u201d posted Republican U.S. Sen. Tim Sheehy of Montana.",
      "In the age of AI, misinformation and disinformation, there\u2019s abundant reason to question emotionally and politically charged images. So when \u201cthe cigarette girl\u201d appeared online this month, plenty of users did just that.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear, for example, whether she was lighting up inside Iran or somewhere with free-speech protections as a sign of solidarity. Some spotted a background that seemed to be in Canada. She confirmed that in interviews. But did her collar line up correctly? Was the flame realistic? Would a real woman let her hair get so close to the fire?",
      "Many wondered: Is the \u201ccigarette girl\u201d an example of \u201cpsyops?\u201d That, too, is unclear. That\u2019s a feature of warfare and statecraft as old as human conflict, in which an image or sound is deliberately disseminated by someone with a stake in the outcome. From the allies\u2019 fake radio broadcasts during World War II to the Cold War\u2019s nuclear missile parades, history is rich with examples.",

      "Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Social media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said.",
      "\u201cWe stared down everybody who said it couldn\u2019t be done, some of the most powerful and rich companies in the world and their supporters,\u201d communications minister Anika Wells told reporters on Friday. \u201cNow Australian parents can be confident that their kids can have their childhoods back.\u201d",
      "The figures, reported to Australia\u2019s government by 10 social media platforms, were the first to show the scale of the landmark ban since it was enacted in December over fears about the effects of harmful online environments on young people. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.",
      "Under Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.",
      "To verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder\u2019s face, or make inferences from data already available such has how long an account has been held.",
      "About 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country\u2019s eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84% of 8- to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million \u201cdeactivated or restricted\u201d was encouraging.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,\u201d Inman Grant said.",
      "The 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia's regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.",
      "Australian officials didn\u2019t break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.",
      "In the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticized the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn't apply might not prioritize safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms \u2014 a concern that led to the ban's enactment.",
      "The law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia\u2019s sprawling rural areas.",

      "Elon Musk's AI assistant, Grok, is facing scrutiny from governments worldwide",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk's Grok keeps getting into trouble, and this time, more of the world's governments are trying to intervene.",
      "First launched in 2023, Grok is Musk\u2019s attempt to outdo rivals such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT and Google\u2019s Gemini in building an AI assistant powered by a large language model, which is trained on vast pools of data to help predict the most plausible next word in a sentence. It's the main product of Musk's AI startup, xAI, which has been merged with his social media platform, X. Much like ChatGPT and Gemini, Musk's company has also folded AI image generation capabilities into the chatbot.",
      "Musk\u2019s deliberate efforts to mold Grok into a challenger of what he considers the tech industry\u2019s \u201cwoke\u201d orthodoxy on race, gender and politics have repeatedly got the chatbot into trouble, such as last year when it spouted antisemitic tropes, praised Adolf Hitler and made other hateful commentary to users of Musk\u2019s X social media platform. The chatbot was also found last year to be echoing the views of its billionaire creator, so much so that it would sometimes search online for Musk\u2019s stance on an issue before offering up an opinion.",
      "Beyond politics, Musk's vision of himself as a \u201cfree speech absolutist\u201d has led to his company's more lax approach to sexualized images. Other mainstream chatbots block the creation of pornographic images. OpenAI had originally planned to enable ChatGPT to engage in \u201cerotica for verified adults,\u201d starting last month, but it has not done so.",
      "Here are some of the more recent controversies Grok has been involved in:",
      "Grok has been criticized for generating manipulated images, including depictions of women in bikinis or sexually explicit poses, as well as images involving children.",
      "The problem emerged after the launch last year of Grok Imagine, an AI image generator that allows users to create videos and pictures by typing in text prompts. It includes a so-called \u201cspicy mode\u201d that can generate adult content.",
      "It snowballed late last month when Grok, which is hosted on X, apparently began granting a large number of user requests to modify images posted by others, with requests such as \u201cput her in a transparent bikini.\u201d",
      "In the last week, governments around the world have condemned the platform and opened investigations.",
      "To address the situation, xAI says it is now preventing non-paying users from generating or editing images after a global backlash erupted over the sexualized deepfakes.",
      "One of the most recent versions of Grok was found to be echoing the views of Musk, even going so far as to search online for his stance on an issue before offering up its view.",
      "The unusual behavior of Grok 4, released in July, surprised some experts.",
      "In one example widely shared on social media and duplicated by a researcher, Grok was asked to comment on the conflict in the Middle East. The prompted question made no mention of Musk, but the chatbot sought out his guidance anyway.",
      "The chatbot told independent researcher Simon Willison that \u201cElon Musk\u2019s stance could provide context, given his influence,\u201d according to a video of the interaction. \u201cCurrently looking at his views to see if they guide the answer.\u201d",
      "After Grok allegedly disseminated content insulting to Turkey\u2019s president and other Turkish figures, a court ordered a ban on accessing the platform last year.",
      "The chatbot posted vulgarities against Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, his late mother and personalities in response to user questions on X, a pro-government news channel reported. Offensive responses were also directed at modern Turkey\u2019s founder, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, according to other media outlets.",

      "Grok was forced reverse course after it appeared to make antisemitic posts, including comments that praised Adolf Hitler, saying it was taking down \u201cinappropriate posts.\u201d",
      "The chatbot Grok shared several antisemitic posts, including the trope that Jews run Hollywood, and denied that such a stance could be described as Nazism.",
      "\u201cLabeling truths as hate speech stifles discussion,\u201d Grok said. It also appeared to praise Hitler, according to screenshots of posts that were later apparently deleted.",
      "After making one of the posts, Grok walked back the comments, saying it was \u201can unacceptable error from an earlier model iteration, swiftly deleted\u201d and that it condemned \u201cNazism and Hitler unequivocally \u2014 his actions were genocidal horrors.\u201d",
      "Musk said Grok had been improved significantly, and users \u201cshould notice a difference.\u201d",

      "The company said in May that an employee made a change that \u201cdirected Grok to provide a specific response on a political topic,\u201d which \u201cviolated xAI\u2019s internal policies and core values.\u201d",
      "Grok had been posting a day earlier about \u201cwhite genocide\u201d in South Africa in its responses to users on X, asking a variety of questions, most of which had nothing to do with South Africa.",
      "There were exchanges about streaming service Max reviving the HBO name, video games and baseball that all quickly veered into unrelated commentary on alleged calls to violence against South Africa\u2019s white farmers. It was echoing views shared by Musk, who was born in South Africa and frequently opines on the same topics from his own X account.",

    "story": [
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to boost production of rare earths and the other critical minerals",
      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers have proposed creating a new agency with $2.5 billion to spur production of rare earths and the other critical minerals, while the Trump administration has already taken aggressive actions to break China's grip on the market for these materials that are crucial to high-tech products, including cellphones, electric vehicles, jet fighters and missiles.",
      "It\u2019s too early to tell how the bill, if passed, could align with the White House\u2019s policy, but whatever the approach, the U.S. is in a crunch to drastically reduce its reliance on China, after Beijing used its dominance of the critical minerals market to gain leverage in the trade war with Washington. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to a one-year truce in October, by which Beijing would continue to export critical minerals while the U.S. would ease its export controls of U.S. technology on China.",
      "The Pentagon has shelled out nearly $5 billion over the past year to help ensure its access to the materials after the trade war laid bare just how beholden the U.S. is to China, which processes more than 90% of the world's critical minerals. To break Beijing's chokehold, the U.S. government is taking equity stakes in a handful of critical mineral companies and in some cases guaranteeing the price of some commodities using an approach that seems more likely to come out of China's playbook instead of a Republican administration.",
      "The bill that Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., introduced Thursday would favor a more market-based approach by setting up the independent body charged with building a stockpile of critical minerals and related products, stabilizing prices, and encouraging domestic and allied production to help ensure stable supply not only for the military but also the broader economy and manufacturers.",
      "Shaheen called the legislation \u201ca historic investment\u201d to make the U.S. economy more resilient against China\u2019s dominance that she said has left the U.S. vulnerable to economic coercion. Young said creating the new reserve is \u201ca much-needed, aggressive step to protect our national and economic security.\u201d",
      "When Trump imposed widespread tariffs last spring, Beijing fought back not only with tit-for-tat tariffs but severe restrictions on the export of critical minerals, forcing Washington to back down and eventually agree to the truce when the leaders met in South Korea.",
      "On Monday, in his speech at SpaceX, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed that the Pentagon has in the past five months alone \u201cdeployed over $4.5 billion in capital commitments\u201d to close six critical minerals deals that will \u201chelp free the United States from market manipulation.\u201d",
      "One of the deals involves a $150 million of preferred equity by the Pentagon in Atlantic Alumina Co. to save the country's last alumina refinery and build its first large-scale gallium production facility in Louisiana.",
      "Last year, the Pentagon announced it would buy $400 million of preferred stock in MP Materials, which owns the country's only operational rare earths mine at Mountain Pass, California, and entered into a $1.4-billion joint partnership with ReElement Technologies Corp. to build up a domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets.",
      "The drastic move by the U.S. government to take equity stakes has prompted some analysts to observe that Washington is pivoting to some form of state capitalism to compete with Beijing.",
      "\u201cDespite the dangers of political interference, the strategic logic is compelling,\u201d wrote Elly Rostoum, a senior fellow at the Washington-based research institute Center for European Policy Analysis. She suggested that the new model could be \u201ca prudent way for the U.S. to ensure strategic autonomy and industrial sovereignty.\u201d",
      "But companies across the industry are welcoming the intervention from Trump's administration.",

That company is trying to finish raising the money it needs to build a mine in southeast Nebraska.",
      "In addition to trying to boost domestic production, the Trump administration has sought to secure some of these crucial elements through allies. In October, Trump signed an $8.5 billion agreement with Australia to invest in mining there, and the president is now aggressively trying to take over Greenland in the hope of being able to one day extract rare earths from there.",
      "On Monday, finance ministers from the G7 nations huddled in Washington over their vulnerability in the critical mineral supply chains.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led several rounds of trade negotiations with Beijing, urged attendees to increase their supply chain resiliency and thanked them for their willingness to work together \u201ctoward decisive action and lasting solutions,\u201d according to a Treasury statement.",
      "The bill introduced on Thursday by Shaheen and Young would encourage production with both domestic and allied producers.",
      "Congress in the past several years has pushed for legislation to protect the U.S. military and civilian industry from Beijing's chokehold. The issue became a pressing concern every time China turned to its proven tactics of either restricting the supply or turned to dumping extra critical minerals on the market to depress prices and drive any potential competitors out of business.",
      "The Biden administration sought to increase demand for critical minerals domestically by pushing for more electric vehicle and windmill production. But the Trump administration largely eliminated the incentives for those products and instead chose to focus on increasing critical minerals production directly.",
      "Most of those past efforts were on a much more limited scale than what the government has done in the past year, and they were largely abandoned after China relented and eased access to critical minerals.",

      "In a vast country whose young people are increasingly on the move, the new, one-button app \u2014 which has taken the country by digital storm this month \u2014 is essentially exactly what it says it is. People who live alone in far-off cities and may be at risk \u2014 or just perceived as such by friends or relatives \u2014 can push an outsized green circle on their phone screens and send proof of life over the network to a friend or loved one. The cost: 8 yuan (about $1.10).",

      "Developed by three young people in their 20s, \u201cAre You Dead?\u201d became the most downloaded paid app on the Apple App Store in China last week, according to local media reports. It is also becoming a top download in places as diverse as Singapore and the Netherlands, Britain and India and the United States \u2014 in line with the developers' attitude that loneliness and safety aren't just Chinese issues.",
      "\u201cEvery country has young people who move to big cities to chase their dreams,\u201d Ian L\u00fc, 29, one of the app's developers, said Thursday.",
      "L\u00fc, who worked and lived alone in the southern city of Shenzhen for five years, experienced such loneliness himself. He said the need for a frictionless check-in is especially strong among introverts. \u201cIt's unrealistic,\u201d he said, \u201cto message people every day just to tell them you're still alive.\u201d",
      "Against the backdrop of modern and increasingly frenetic Chinese life, the market for the app is understandable.",
      "Traditionally, Chinese families have tended to live together or at least in close proximity across generations \u2014 something embedded deep in the nation's culture until recent years. That has changed in the last few decades with urbanization and rapid economic growth that have sent many Chinese to join what is effectively a diaspora within their own nation \u2014 and taken hundreds of millions far from parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles.",

      "Consider Chen Xingyu, 32, who has lived on her own for years in Kunming, the capital of southern China\u2019s Yunnan province. \u201cIt is new and funny. The name \u2019Are You Dead?' is very interesting,\u201d Chen said.",

Officials said the health problem was unrelated to spacewalk preparations or other station operations, but offered no other details, citing medical privacy. They stressed it was not an emergency situation.",
      "NASA said it would stick to the same entry and splashdown procedures at flight\u2019s end, with the usual assortment of medical experts aboard the recovery ship in the Pacific. It was another middle-of-the-night crew return for SpaceX, coming less than 11 hours after undocking from the space station. NASA said it was not yet known how quickly all four would be flown from California to Houston, home to Johnson Space Center and the base for astronauts.",
      "One U.S. and two Russian astronauts remain aboard the orbiting lab, just 1 1/2 months into an eight-month mission that began with a Soyuz rocket liftoff from Kazakhstan. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the launch of a fresh four-person crew from Florida, currently targeted for mid-February.",
      "Computer modeling predicted a medical evacuation from the space station every three years, but NASA hasn't had one in its 65 years of human spaceflight. The Russians have not been as fortunate. In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin came down with a serious infection or related illness aboard his country\u2019s Salyut 7 space station, prompting an early return. A few other Soviet cosmonauts encountered less serious health issues that shortened their flights.",
      "It was the first spaceflight for Cardman, a 38, biologist and polar explorer who missed out on spacewalking, as well as Platonov, 39, a former fighter pilot with the Russian Air Force who had to wait a few extra years to get to space because of an undisclosed health issue. Cardman should have launched last year but was bumped to make room on the way down for NASA\u2019s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were stuck nearly a year at the space station because of Boeing\u2019s capsule problems.",
      "Fincke, 58, a retired Air Force colonel, and Yui, 55, a retired fighter pilot with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, were repeat space fliers. Finke has spent 1 1/2 years in orbit over four missions and conducted nine spacewalks on previous flights, making him one of NASA\u2019s top performers. Last week, Yui celebrated his 300th day in space over two station stays, sharing stunning views of Earth, including Japan\u2019s Mount Fuji and breathtaking auroras.",

      "SpaceX's Starlink has dropped fees to help Iranian demonstrators share protest details globally, activists say",
      "BANGKOK -- Iranian demonstrators' ability to get details of bloody nationwide protests out to the world has been given a strong boost, with SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet service dropping its fees to allow more people to circumvent the Tehran government's strongest attempt ever to prevent information from spilling outside its borders, activists said Wednesday.",
      "The move by the American aerospace company run by Elon Musk follows the complete shutdown of telecommunications and internet access to Iran's 85 million people on Jan. 8, as protests expanded over the Islamic Republic's faltering economy and the collapse of its currency.",
      "SpaceX has not officially announced the decision and did not respond to request for comment, but activists told The Associated Press that Starlink has been available for free to anyone in Iran with the receivers since Tuesday.",
      "\u201cStarlink has been crucial,\u201d said Mehdi Yahyanejad, an Iranian whose nonprofit Net Freedom Pioneers has helped smuggle units into Iran, pointing to video that emerged Sunday showing rows of bodies at a forensic medical center near Tehran.",
      "\u201cThat showed a few hundred bodies on the ground, that came out because of Starlink,\" he said in an interview from Los Angeles. \"I think that those videos from the center pretty much changed everyone's understanding of what's happening because they saw it with their own eyes.\u201d",
      "Since the outbreak of demonstrations Dec. 28, the death toll has risen to more than 2,500 people, primarily protesters but also security personnel, according to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.",
      "Starlink is banned in Iran by telecommunication regulations, as the country never authorized the importation, sale or use of the devices. Activists fear they could be accused of helping the U.S. or Israel by using Starlink and charged with espionage, which can carry the death penalty.",
      "The first units were smuggled into Iran in 2022 during protests over the country's mandatory headscarf law, after Musk got the Biden administration to exempt the Starlink service from Iran sanctions.",
      "Since then, more than 50,000 units are estimated to have been sneaked in, with people going through great lengths to conceal them, using virtual private networks while on the system to hide IP addresses and taking other precautions, said Ahmad Ahmadian, the executive director of Holistic Resilience, a Los Angeles-based organization that was responsible for getting some of the first Starlink units into Iran.",
      "Starlink is a global internet network that relies on some 10,000 satellites orbiting Earth. Subscribers need to have equipment, including an antenna requires a line of site to the satellite, so must be deployed in the open, where it could be spotted by authorities. Many Iranians disguise them as solar panels, Ahmadian said.",
      "After efforts to shut down communications during the 12-day war with Israel in June proved to be not terribly effective, Iranian security services have taken more \u201cextreme tactics\u201d now to both jam Starlink's radio signals and GPS systems, Ahmadian said in a phone interview. After Holistic Resilience passed on reports to SpaceX, Ahmadian said, the company pushed a firmware update that helped circumvent the new countermeasures.",
      "Security services also rely on informers to tell them who might be using Starlink, search internet and social media traffic for signs it has been used, and there have been reports they have raided apartments with satellite dishes.",
      "\u201cThere has always been a cat-and-mouse game,\u201d said Ahmadian, who fled Iran himself in 2012, after serving time in prison for student activism. \u201cThe government is using every tool in its toolbox.\u201d",
      "Still, Ahmadian noted that the government jamming attempts had only been effective in certain urban areas, suggesting that security services lack the resources to block Starlink more broadly.",

      "\u201cThis time around they really shut it down, even fixed landlines were not working,\u201d he said. \u201cBut despite this, the information was coming out and it also shows how distributed this community of Starlink users is in the country.\u201d",
      "Musk has made Starlink free for use during several natural disasters, and Ukraine has relied heavily on the service since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. It was initially funded by SpaceX and later through an American government contract.",

      "A proposal to tax the accumulated wealth of California billionaires has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley and across the state",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A proposed billionaires' tax in California has ignited a political uproar in Silicon Valley, with tech titans threatening to leave the state while Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom maneuvers to defeat a levy that he fears will lead to an exodus of wealth.",
      "A technology mecca, California has more billionaires than any other state \u2014 a few hundred, by some estimates. Nearly half its personal income tax revenue, a financial backbone in the nearly $350 billion budget, comes from the top 1% of earners.",
      "A large health care union is attempting to place a proposal before voters in November that would impose a one-time 5% tax on the assets of billionaires \u2014 including stocks, art, businesses, collectibles and intellectual property \u2014 to backfill federal funding cuts to health services for lower-income people that were signed by President Donald Trump last year.",
      "In a state with a vast gap between rich and poor, the plan has resulted in a tangle of competing interests at a time when both Democrats and Republicans are struggling to respond to economic anxiety driven by rising costs ahead of this year's midterm elections.",
      "An online war of words has tech leaders pondering a hollowing out of Silicon Valley, and millions of dollars are flowing to political committees engaged in the fight. That includes $3 million from billionaire Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal, to a committee tied to a business group opposing the tax.",
      "However it's not clear if the proposal will make the ballot, with more than 870,000 petition signatures required for it to qualify.",
      "Although the tax would affect only a minuscule slice of California's roughly 39 million residents, it would siphon money from an immense pool of wealth. If would apply retroactively to billionaires living in the state as of Jan. 1.",
      "At least 25 billionaires listed among Forbes magazine\u2019s 2025 rankings of the world\u2019s 500 wealthiest people either lived in California or had some significant ties to the state, based on a review by The Associated Press. But determining whether they were full-time residents or just frequent visitors could turn into a matter of dispute, since many of them own property elsewhere.",
      "\u201cYou are really playing with fire with this one,\u201d said Aaron Levie, CEO of the publicly traded Silicon Valley company Box. He fears that the proposed tax would drive entrepreneurs to look elsewhere to run their companies and launch startups.",
      "Even liberal-leaning tech pioneers would \u201cfind it absurd just on pure economic and structural grounds, even if they might agree that the cause itself is very worthy,\u201d said Levie, who is not a billionaire.",
      "Newsom has long opposed state-level wealth taxes, believing such levies would be disadvantageous for the world\u2019s fourth-largest economy. At a time when California is strapped for cash and he is considering a 2028 presidential run, he is trying to block the proposal before it reaches the ballot.",
      "Analysts say an exodus of billionaires could mean a loss of hundreds of millions of tax dollars.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why Newsom\u2019s path to the Democratic nomination is not going to be an easy one,\u201d Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney said. \u201cHe\u2019s already facing a (budget) deficit the size of which is uncertain ... and in the years to come, a billionaires tax that could backfire badly.\u201d",
      "The proposal has created a deep rift between Newsom and prominent members of his party's progressive wing, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who endorsed it and said it should be a template for other states.",

      "Trump has also formulated what he calls the \"Donroe Doctrine,\" a play on words of the Monroe Doctrine that reimagines\u00a0the American role in the Western Hemisphere. That change in vision was punctuated by an on-the-ground operation in Venezuela to capture then-President Nicolas Maduro and bring him to the U.S. to face charges for allegedly supporting cartels that brought narcotics into the U.S.",

      "The president has also called for the U.S. to own Greenland and is ratcheting up tension with European allies as he tries to make good on his promised efforts to own Denmark's semiautonomous territory. Those tensions have reached a fever pitch around Trump's one-year mark in office as the president has not ruled out taking Greenland by force.",

Just one day later, the stock market tanked in reaction, with stocks losing nearly $3.1 trillion in value.",
      "A few days later, the president paused those sweeping tariffs to give time for the administration to instead cut deals with nations. Trump said that investors had gotten \"the yips,\" which is why he pulled back. The administration set to work, promising to strike 90 deals in 90 days with America's trading partners.",

      "Trump says he wants to give money directly to Americans so they can buy their own insurance, but it's unclear how that would work, how much they will get or whether it would cover their health care costs. A recent poll found 52% of voters saying Trump has \"hurt\" the cost of health care.",
      "The president has also planned to unveil a plan that would lower housing costs during an upcoming trip to Davos, Switzerland.

      "What started with gilded additions to the Oval Office and the usual redecorating quickly became more long-lasting changes to the White House. The president repaved the historic Rose Garden with white stone and added what he dubbed the \"Presidential Walk of Fame\" which includes portraits and politically charged plaques about American presidents through history.",
      "One of the biggest moves came in October of 2025, when Trump tore down the White House East Wing to make way for a 90,000 square foot ballroom. The major construction and rapid pace of the tear-down faced major criticism from many Democrats.",
      "The president has made his mark on other D.C. landmarks too. The president's hand-picked board of the Kennedy Performing Arts Center voted in mid-December to rename the structure the \"Trump-Kennedy Center.\"",

      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a \u201ctargeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders.",

      "Jury selection was expected to last about two days, with opening statements scheduled for next Monday for a trial projected to last until early March.",
      "In papers filed in Manhattan federal court on Saturday, defense lawyers complained that prosecutors have unfairly treated their clients by rewriting the indictment as recently as last week and by recently adding charges the defense has not had time to investigate.",
      "The latest iteration of the indictment was filed Thursday, the third time in two months that prosecutors have updated an indictment that accuses Oren, Tal and Alon Alexander of showering women with free travel and luxury accommodations before drugging and raping them in vacation destinations like New York's Hamptons.",
      "Oren and Tal Alexander were luxury real estate moguls for over a decade before co-founding a real estate firm, Official, which specialized in high-end properties in Miami, New York and Los Angeles. Oren and Alon Alexander are 38-year-old twins while Tal Alexander is 39. Alon, who went to law school, was an executive at his family's security firm.",

      "Prosecutors say the brothers typically met their victims on dating apps, through social events, at bars and nightclubs, and sometimes through party promoters before providing drugs, including cocaine and psychedelic mushrooms, or drugging their drinks before sexually assaulting them.",
      "Defense lawyers urged Judge Valerie E. Caproni to drop some charges from consideration at this month's trial if she doesn't toss them out entirely, including a conspiracy count in which the description of the charge was largely reduced in size.",

      "Prosecutors allege that Oren Alexander in April 2009 persuaded or coerced an incapacitated female who was 17 years and 10 months old to engage in sexually explicit conduct that could be filmed. The defense lawyers say her birth certificate can't be authenticated because it was issued by a former Soviet Republic that is now in a war zone.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge refused Monday to temporarily block the Trump administration from enforcing a new policy requiring a week's notice before members of Congress can visit immigration detention facilities.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in Washington, D.C., concluded that the Department of Homeland Security didn't violate an earlier court order when it reimposed a seven-day notice requirement for congressional oversight visits to Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities.",
      "Cobb stressed that she wasn't ruling on whether the new policy passes legal muster. Rather, she said, plaintiffs' attorneys representing several Democratic members of Congress used the wrong \"procedural vehicle\" to challenge it. The judge also concluded that the Jan. 8 policy is a new agency action that isn't subject to her prior order in the plaintiffs' favor.",
      "Plaintiffs' lawyers asked Cobb to intervene after three Democratic members of Congress from Minnesota were blocked from visiting an ICE facility near Minneapolis earlier this month \u2014 three days after an ICE officer shot and killed U.S. citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis.",
      "Last month, Cobb temporarily blocked an administration oversight visit policy. She ruled Dec. 17 that it is likely illegal for ICE to demand a week\u2019s notice from members of Congress seeking to visit and observe conditions in ICE facilities.",
      "A day after Good\u2019s death, U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem secretly signed a new memorandum reinstating another seven-day notice requirement. Plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers from the Democracy Forward legal advocacy group said DHS didn't disclose the latest policy until after U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar, Kelly Morrison and Angie Craig initially were turned away from an ICE facility in the Minneapolis federal building.",
      "On Monday, Cobb ruled that the new policy is similar but different than the one announced in June 2025.",
      "\u201cThe Court emphasizes that it denies Plaintiffs\u2019 motion only because it is not the proper avenue to challenge Defendants\u2019 January 8, 2026 memorandum and the policy stated therein, rather than based on any kind of finding that the policy is lawful,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Democracy Forward spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz said they were reviewing the judge's latest order.",
      "\u201cWe will continue to use every legal tool available to stop the administration\u2019s efforts to hide from congressional oversight,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Twelve other Democratic members of Congress sued in Washington to challenge ICE\u2019s amended visitor policies after they were denied entry to detention facilities. Their lawsuit accused Republican President Donald Trump\u2019s administration of obstructing congressional oversight of the centers during its nationwide surge in immigration enforcement operations.",

      "\"Appropriations are not a game. They are a law,\" plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Christine Coogle said during a hearing Wednesday.",
      "Justice Department attorney Amber Richer said the Jan. 8 policy signed by Noem is distinct from the policies that Cobb suspended last month.",
      "\u201cThis is really a challenge to a new policy,\u201d Richer said.",
      "Plaintiffs' attorneys said the matter is urgent because members of Congress are negotiating funding for DHS and ICE for the next fiscal year with DHS\u2019s annual appropriations due to expire Jan. 30.",
      "\u201cThis is a critical moment for oversight, and members of Congress must be able to conduct oversight at ICE detention facilities, without notice, to obtain urgent and essential information for ongoing funding negotiations,\u201d the lawyers wrote.",
      "Government attorneys have said it\u2019s merely speculative for the legislators to be concerned that conditions in ICE facilities change over the course of a week. But the judge rejected those arguments last month.",
      "\u201cThe changing conditions within ICE facilities means that it is likely impossible for a Member of Congress to reconstruct the conditions at a facility on the day that they initially sought to enter,\u201d wrote Cobb, who was nominated to the bench by Democratic President Joe Biden.",

      "Communities across the U.S. held parades, panels and service projects for the 40th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. Day",
      "As communities across the country on Monday hosted parades, panels and service projects for the 40th federal observation of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the political climate for some is more fraught with tensions than festive with reflection on the slain Black American civil rights icon's legacy.",
      "In the year since Donald Trump's second inauguration fell on King Day, the Republican president has adopted a scorched earth stance against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and targeted mostly Black-led cities for federal law enforcement operations, among other policies that many King admirers have criticized.",
      "One year ago, Trump's executive orders \u201cEnding Illegal Discrimination And Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity\u201d and \u201cEnding Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing\u201d accelerated a rollback of civil rights and racial justice initiatives in federal agencies, corporations and universities. Last month, the National Park Service announced it will no longer offer free admission to parks on King Day and Juneteenth, but instead on Flag Day and Trump's birthday.",
      "A.R. Bernard, founder, pastor and CEO of the Christian Cultural Center in Brooklyn, told an audience gathered at King's home church in Atlanta Sunday that the Trump administration is attempting to rewrite history.",
      "\u201cWe are living in a moment where America is being tempted to forget the painful truth of its Black history. Slavery being renamed as labor, segregation reduced to a footnote, racial terror explained away as exaggeration,\u201d Bernard said, speaking at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta. \u201cThis is irresponsible, historical revisionism.\u201d",
      "Urgent calls to unite against injustice were interspersed with energetic gospel at Ebenezer, where King preached. A sense that civil and human rights are at stake infused the comments by many speakers there Monday.",
      "U.S. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat and Ebenezer\u2019s senior pastor, invoked a story about King fighting for the Voting Rights Act after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act. He urged the crowd to keep pushing against Trump\u2019s policies, sweeping immigration enforcement and what he described as attempts from the \u201cTrump-Vance regime\u201d to sow division.",
      "\u201cThey are trying to weaponize despair and convince us that we are at war with one another,\u201d Warnock said.",
      "The fatal shooting this month of an unarmed Minneapolis woman in her car by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents sent there to target the city's Somali immigrant population, as well as Trump recently decrying civil rights as discrimination against white people, have only intensified fears of a regression from the social progress King and many others advocated for.",
      "Still, the concerns did not chill many King holiday events planned this year. Some conservative admirers of King say the holiday should be a reminder of the civil rights icon's plea that all people be judged by their character and not their skin color. Some Black advocacy groups, however, vowed a day of resistance and rallies nationwide.",
      "In a recent interview with The New York Times, Trump said he felt the Civil Rights Movement and the reforms it helped usher in were harmful to white people, who \u201cwere very badly treated.\u201d Politicians and advocates say Trump's comments are what are harmful, because they dismiss the hard work of King and others that helped not just Black Americans but other groups, including women and the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "\u201cI think the Civil Rights Movement was one of the things that made our country so unique, that we haven\u2019t always been perfect, but we\u2019ve always strived to be this more perfect union, and that\u2019s what I think the Civil Rights Movement represents,\u201d Gov. Wes Moore, Maryland\u2019s first Black governor and only the nation\u2019s third elected Black governor, said this week in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Maya Wiley, president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, one of the nation\u2019s oldest and largest civil rights coalitions, said the Trump administration's priorities make clear it is actively trying to erase the movement.",
      "\u201cFrom health care access and affordable housing to good paying jobs and union representation,\" Wiley said, \u201cthings Dr. King made part of his clarion call for a beloved community are still at stake and is even more so because (the administration) has dismantled the very terms of government and the norms of our culture.\u201d",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump did issue a proclamation late Monday, writing, \u201cOn this day, I encourage all Americans to recommit themselves to Dr. King\u2019s dream by engaging in acts of service to others, to their community, and to our Nation.\u201d",
      "In Washington Monday, hundreds of people marched along Martin Luther King Jr. Avenue, braving cold weather to honor the civil rights leader. The parade began decades ago as part of the effort to establish a national holiday in King\u2019s honor.",

      "The plaintiffs argue that Hawaii is infringing on people's Second Amendment rights. They say they want to protect themselves at isolated beaches, and many property owners do not put up \u201cguns allowed\u201d signs for fear of scaring off customers.",

      "It was also the most forceful rebuke of Trump from the European allies since he returned to the White House almost a year ago. In recent months, Europeans have mostly opted for diplomacy and flattery around him, even when seeking an end to the war in Ukraine. Sunday\u2019s statement, as well as some European countries sending troops to Greenland for a Danish military training exercise, appeared to be a step away from that strategy.",

      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer also spoke to Trump and told him that \u201capplying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is wrong,\u201d a Downing Street spokeswoman said. That call followed conversations with Rutte, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "Trump's move was also panned domestically.",
      "U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, said Trump\u2019s threatened tariffs on U.S. allies would make Americans \u201cpay more to try to get territory we don\u2019t need.\u201d",

      "Former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said he supports the United States ultimately owning Greenland, but not how Trump is trying to accomplish it.",
      "He said he had concerns whether Trump had the constitutional authority to impose unilateral tariffs on NATO allies, as well as about a threat of a military invasion. Trump\u2019s current position threatens \u201cto fracture that strong relationship, not just with Denmark, but with all of our NATO allies,\u201d Pence said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d",
      "The tariff announcement also drew blowback from Trump's populist allies in Europe.",

      "Karmel Mall in south Minneapolis contains more than a hundred small businesses in suites offering everything from clothing and food to insurance and accounting services. On Thursday, the noisy hallways inside lay quiet, save for occasional chatter between neighboring vendors. The smell of fried food still wafted from the bakeries, the central heating hummed and the sound of Quran recitation flowed quietly from some shops.",
      "But many sellers sat alone in their clothing stores, waiting for the occasional customer to walk by. Everyone is afraid of federal immigration agents, business owners said.

Since December, Trump has made numerous jabs at the community, calling them \u201cgarbage\u201d and saying \u201cthey contribute nothing.\"",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Prince Harry was back in London on Monday, sitting in the U.K.'s highest court to take part in the third and final of his outstanding legal battles against Britain's tabloid newspapers.",
      "Harry is among the high-profile claimants, along with Sir Elton John and actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, who have accused the Associated Newspapers group of \"unlawful information gathering.\"",
      "The 41-year-old royal, who lives in California, and his fellow celebrities claim the company, which publishes the Daily Mail and the linked MailOnline website, illegally snooped on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records to generate scoops.",
      "The publisher has denied all of the accusations, calling them \"preposterous smears\" and part of a coordinated effort driven by the claimants' personal dislike of the news media.",
      "In a witness submission seen by CBS News, Harry said it was, \"disturbing to feel that my every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it,\" adding that the \"terrifying\" intrusion made him, \"paranoid beyond belief, isolating me.\"",
      "Harry, the Duke of Sussex, whose case is based on 14 separate newspaper stories, says the alleged illegal information gathering between 1993 and 2011 put a \"massive strain\" on his personal relationships. He has long blamed the media for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 as her vehicle was pursued by photographers on motorcycles.",
      "He listened in court Monday as his lawyer argued that there was, \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering at both the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.\"",
      "Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, will be used in the trial. CBS News' partner network BBC news reported Monday that Harry was expected to take the stand himself to offer evidence.",
      "During his first legal battle with the press, in 2019, against the owners of The Mirror for hacking his phone, Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to give in-person testimony in a British court in more than 130 years. Courts ruled in his favor multiple times in that case.",
      "\"The journalists who used me and the editors who sanctioned this knew full well that I was a practitioner of the 'Dark Arts,'\" private investigator Steve Whittamore said in a witness statement ahead of the trial that began Monday. \"If the information the journalists requested could have been acquired legitimately \u2026 then the newspapers would have had no need to use my particular services.\"",
      "Another witness, known as \"Detective Danno,\" claims to have been paid the equivalent of more than $1 million by the Mail for over 20 years of work for the paper.",
      "The publisher has argued that evidence from private detectives can't be trusted.",
      "Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, said Monday that Prince William appeared to be \"full of confidence\" about his case, but \"he's not really relishing the prospect of being in court all week.\"",
      "Last year, Rupert Murdoch's right-leaning News Group Newspapers settled out of court with the royal, offering a full formal apology for \"serious intrusion\" and a multi-million dollar payout.",
      "The case against Associated Newspapers is expected to last nine weeks, culminating with a decision by Judge Matthew Nicklin, whose verdict will determine not only the lasting reputation of a major media company, but also who foots the bill for tens of millions of dollars in legal costs.",
      "\"If Harry wins this case, it will give him a feeling \u2026 that he wasn't being paranoid all the time,\" Nikkhah told CBS News. \"If Harry loses this case, it's huge jeopardy for him, not just in terms of cost, but in terms of pushing all the way to trial and not seeking to settle. So we have to wait and see, but it's high stakes for Harry.\"",

      "Asked why he decided to do a documentary about Mel Brooks, Apatow said, \"Mel is the reason why most of us went into comedy. You know, when I was a kid (I was born in 1967), all these Mel Brooks movies came out while I was a little kid and trying to figure out what the world meant and who I was. And here was this hilarious, tiny Jewish man who was really loud and brash and confident, and seemed like the coolest guy in the world. And I think me and a lot of people thought, 'Oh, that's the job you would want. You would want to be Mel Brooks.'\"",
      "\"Mel Brooks: The 99 Year Old Man\" streams this week on HBO Max. Co-directed by Michael Bonfiglio, it's the surprisingly personal origin story of a comedy legend \u2013 a Brooklyn kid raised by a single mom whose four sons went off to war.",

      "Brooks: \"I was sent from a provincial tenement in Brooklyn to France, 1104th engineer combat battalion.\"Apatow: \"And the Germans had just left France?\"Brooks: \"Yeah.\"Apatow: \"And so your job was to make sure they didn't leave behind booby traps?\"Brooks\" \"Right.

      "Asked what made Nazis such a frequent target of Brooks, Apatow said, \"The fear that it was gonna happen again. And then if you don't keep pointing out how horrifying this is, then it can, you know, slowly bubble back up, which is something we see right now.\"",
      "And Brooks was equally fearless against racism. His 1974 film \"Blazing Saddles\" is the story of a Black sheriff in a racist town. Critics were divided over the raunchy comedy, but it was a monster hit with moviegoers. And just a few months later, he came out with another monster hit, \"Young Frankenstein.\"",
      "What did releasing two big hits in the same year do for Brooks' status? \"He just became Beyonc\u00e9 for a little while,\" Apatow said. \"I mean, he was a real sensation. And it was kind of shocking, right, that two of the best comedies of all time come out in the same year. And we didn't talk about this in the documentary, but there was some sense that 'Blazing Saddles' was so daring that maybe he made sure to make another movie, so that if they really turned on him with 'Blazing Saddles,' he already had another one to show 'em.\"",
      "It wasn't all just for laughs:\u00a0 Mel Brooks also produced dramas, like David Lynch's \"The Elephant Man,\" but he did it quietly, refusing to put his name on it. \"He thought it was a distraction, and you would think the movie was silly 'cause his name was on it,\" Apatow said. \"But yet, it said Brooksfilms. So, I think people figured it out. I think he should put his name on there.\"",
      "No history of Mel Brooks' life would be complete without a mention of his best friend, comedy giant Carl Reiner. \"It's one of the great friendships of all time, because they were friends for, I mean, 70 years? Maybe more?\" Apatow said. \"You know, some people are just magic together. They just fit. And they adored each other more than I've ever seen two people adore and respect each other. I asked him, you know, 'What is the core of this?' And he said, 'He's my father.'\"",
      "Reiner was actually only four years older, but Brooks looked up to him, and later in life, as widowers, they leaned on one another. [Brooks' wife, Anne Bancroft, died in 2005; Estelle Reiner died in 2008.]",
      "Apatow said the loss of Bancroft was very hard on Brooks: \"He famously would go eat dinner and watch a movie with Carl Reiner at Carl Reiner's house, and he did that for many, many years. And they supported each other. And that's how both of them got through it. And then after Carl died, Mel would go to Carl's house alone and eat dinner and watch a movie. And I asked him why. And he said, 'Because it feels like he's there in some way.'\"",
      "Brooks, who will turn 100 in June, has two Oscars, four Emmys, and the Broadway version of his hit movie \"The Producers\" has 12 Tonys \u2013 a record that still stands today. He also won three Grammys, giving him rare EGOT status.",
      "What's more, he's lived long enough to see how his work endures, in his films, and in the countless comedians he inspired.",
      "Asked what Brooks thought his legacy was, Apatow replied, \"He said he thought he was put on this Earth to make people laugh, and he did that.\"",
      "\"What do you think Mel Brooks' legacy is?\" I asked.",
      "\"The main one is probably the funniest person of all time, and the creator of some of the best films of all time, one of the great Broadway musicals of all time, who had the courage to make comedy, both about unimportant things and the most important things, and he did it longer than anybody,\" Apatow said.",

    "summary": "The Swedish actor has been in 150 films and TV shows, from \"Breaking the Waves\" and \"Mamma Mia!\" to \"Andor.\" He talks about his Golden Globe-winning performance in \"Sentimental Value,\" playing a filmmaker-father trying to reconcile with his actress-daughters.",
    "story": [
      "Actor Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd may be well-known in Sweden \u2013 his picture is prominently displayed at the airport \u2013 but he dismisses that it is a big deal. \"Sweden is a small country!\" he laughs.",
      "He's self-effacing, and while Skarsg\u00e4rd was recognized during our stroll through his hometown of Stockholm, respectful, shy Swedes may help keep any Hollywood-actor-ego in check. Skarsg\u00e4rd noted, \"They don't say like Americans \u2013 OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU!!!\"",
      "He's recognizable from any number of roles over the decades, from Hollywood blockbusters (\"The Hunt for Red October,\" \"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\"), popular streaming shows (\"Andor\"), European art-house fare (\"Breaking the Waves\"), and even an ABBA musical.",
      "I said, \"This morning I was watching you singing in 'Mamma Mia'...\"",
      "\"Oh. Watching is okay, but listening to it?\" Skarsg\u00e4rd laughed. \"I've tried to get into projects where I enjoy myself and have a fun time. And that's why I'm not bored. I made 150 films. I still love it, you know?\"",
      "\"It seems impossible to make that many films,\" I said.",
      "\"Well, some are very short.\"",
      "His break came at age 16 on Swedish television, in \"Bombi Bitt och jag.\" Now, at 74, he's reached a new high, in the Norwegian film \"Sentimental Value.\" He plays a once-successful filmmaker trying to reconcile with his estranged daughters.",
      "He described getting the role as a chef's kiss.",
      "\"You think this is the best role for you ever?\" I asked.",
      "\"Maybe \u2013 I don't know,\" Skarsg\u00e5rd replied.",
      "He picked up a Golden Globe for his performance just last week.",
      "He has many moments in the film where the camera just watches him, where he's not saying much, but he is saying a lot with his expression. \"I love that stuff,\" he said. \"Movies, real movies are not literature. Cinema to me is what happens in the image. Not what is said; what is not said.\"",
      "In the film, he plays a father of two. In real life he's the father of eight. All live nearby, and all have worked in the film industry, five of them actors. \"It's insane,\" he said of the \"family business.\" \"I mean, what is the chance? I didn't encourage them. They have no illusions about the business. They see I am I'm happy and I'm enjoying what I'm doing, so they probably learn from that.\"",
      "He playfully sparred with one of his sons, Alexander, when the two were nominated for the same Gotham Award last year.",
      "Alexander: \"'Sentimental Value,' beautiful film. You play yourself, right?\"Stellan: \"That's an insult.\"Alexander: \"Absentee father.\"",
      "I asked Stellan, \"Did you ever find that you had difficulty in balancing family and career?\"",
      "\"I sort of made sure that I was at home a lot,\" he replied. \"You can't be a perfect father always. I mean, you gotta accept, and the kids have to accept, I'm flawed. Good luck!\"",
      "At Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theatre, he recalled appearing in Moliere's \"The School of Wives,\" but stumbled on the name of his co-star. \"That's what I'm talking about,\" he said. \"Had a stroke. That makes me forget my language, forget words, and that makes me more stupid and makes me less funny and everything.\"",
      "\"Do you really feel that? Less funny?\"",
      "\"I felt so funny before.\"",
      "\"Must be tough.\"",
      "\"Yeah, well, I'm 74 years old, and I'm alive.\"",
      "Since that 2022 stroke, he wears an earpiece on set to help with lines. \"It's actually more complicated than learning the lines, because the prompter has to say their line while the other actor is talking,\" he said.",
      "He wore it while shooting \"Sentimental Value,\" a film about the pull between career and what's really important.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd said, \"I've had kids in the '70s, in the '80s, in the '90s, in the '00s, and in the '10s.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you learn more from having kids for five decades, or making 150 films?\"",
      "\"Maybe I couldn't have made 150 films if I hadn't have eight kids to learn from,\" he replied. \"I stole things from them. Like, expressions and the sort of naive attitude towards everything. Just watching them is fantastic.\"",
      "It's a curiosity in humanity that Skarsg\u00e5rd explores, and expresses, through acting. \"It is like being a child,\" he said. \"You never grow up. You're allowed to play all the time, even as an adult.\"",
      "\"Is that how you feel now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. It's make-believe, and kids in the sandbox, they do it all the time. And they shouldn't stop.\"",

    "summary": "Another allegation against Busfield was reported to law enforcement the same day he turned himself in, according to a court filing.",
    "story": [
      "Emmy Award-winning actor Timothy Busfield made his first court appearance on Wednesday, a day after turning himself in to authorities to face charges of child sex abuse stemming from allegations that he inappropriately touched a minor on the set of a TV series he was directing in New Mexico.",
      "Busfield was ordered held without bond. He appeared remotely via a video link from jail. Whether he remains in jail will be the subject of a detention hearing scheduled for Tuesday.",
      "Albuquerque police\u00a0issued a warrant for Busfield's arrest last week on two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor and one count of child abuse. A criminal complaint alleges the acts occurred on the set of the series \"The Cleaning Lady,\" which was filmed in Albuquerque.",
      "\"Tim Busfield denies the allegations in the criminal complaint and maintains they are completely false,\" attorney Larry Stein said in a statement to CBS News. \"As a voluntary step, he submitted to an independent polygraph examination regarding those allegations and passed.\"",
      "The 68-year-old actor, who is married to actor Melissa Gilbert and is known for appearances in \"The West Wing,\" \"Field of Dreams\" and \"Thirtysomething,\" has vowed to fight the charges. In a video shared before turning himself in, Busfield called the allegations lies.",
      "During Wednesday's brief court appearance, Busfield stood silent and expressionless, dressed in orange prison clothes, while a defense attorney spoke on his behalf.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking to keep Busfield in custody pending trial, citing a \"history of alleged sexual misconduct.\" They filed a motion early Wednesday detailing their reasons for the request, pointing to what they described as a documented pattern of sexual misconduct, abuse of authority and grooming behavior by Busfield over two decades. They also said witnesses have expressed fear regarding retaliation and professional harm.",
      "Another allegation was reported to law enforcement the same day Busfield turned himself in, Albuquerque Deputy District Attorney Savannah Brandenburg-Koch told the judge Wednesday in a court filing. A father of a then-16-year-old girl alleged Busfield kissed and inappropriately touched his daughter, who he said was auditioning for a role at B Street Theatre, an organization Busfield and his brother founded in Sacramento, California. The incident occurred several years ago, according to the court document.",
      "Busfield allegedly \"begged the family to not report to law enforcement if he received therapy,\" Brandenburg-Koch said in the motion. The girl's father, who is a therapist himself, said he thought it was the best thing to do at the time, according to the prosecutor.",
      "In a statement to CBS Sacramento, B Street Theatre said that though Busfield is its founder, he has not had an active role in its operations in any capacity since 2001. The theater declined to comment further on Busfield due to the ongoing investigation.",
      "The motion filed in Bernalillo County Metropolitan Court seeking to keep Busfield in custody also states that research and experience show that offenders are uniquely positioned to evade accountability and circumvent safeguards designed to protect children when they wield authority, status or influence.",
      "\"In light of the defendant's demonstrated disregard for boundaries, authority and compliance, no condition or combination of conditions of release can reasonably protect the victims or the community,\" the motion states.",
      "It will be up to a judge to determine whether to grant the request. A detention hearing has yet to be scheduled.",
      "Prosecutors also took issue with Busfield disseminating a video to the media outlet TMZ on Tuesday, suggesting he was prioritizing \"personal narrative control and public relations\" over compliance with the court process.",
      "According to the criminal complaint, an investigator with the police department says the child reported that he was 7 years old when Busfield allegedly touched him multiple times on private areas over his clothing. Busfield allegedly touched him on another occasion when he was 8, the complaint said.",
      "The complaint also says the child was reportedly afraid to tell anyone because Busfield was the director and he feared he would get mad at him.",
      "The boy's twin brother told authorities he was also touched by Busfield but did not specify where. He said he didn't say anything because he didn't want to get in trouble.",
      "The mother of the twins reported to Child Protective Services that the abuse occurred between November 2022 and spring 2024, the complaint said.",
      "In an interview with police last fall, Busfield denied the allegations and suggested that the boys' mother was seeking revenge for her children being replaced on the series. The argument was echoed by Busfield's attorney on Tuesday.",
      "The investigation began in November 2024 after a call from a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. The boys' parents had gone there at the recommendation of a law firm, the complaint said.",
      "Busfield's attorney said an independent investigation by Warner Bros. was unable to corroborate allegations of inappropriate behavior by Busfield. But prosecutors in their filing argued that the investigator failed to talk to key witnesses.",
      "A publicist for Gilbert said she is \"not making public statements at this time.\"",
      "\"Any purported 'statements' circulating online \u2014 including AI-generated deepfakes of her 'breaking her silence' \u2014 should not be treated as coming from her,\" publicist Ame Van Iden said in a statement, adding, \"Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.\"",

      "The House\u00a0approved a measure\u00a0last week to extend the tax credits for three years after 17 Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. Yet the extension faces an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, which previously rejected a separate plan to extend the credits for three years.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on a compromise that includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies, but GOP senators said Thursday that progress has stalled.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Thursday announced a health care proposal\u00a0that the White House said would \"send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",
      "In the meantime, the clock is ticking for Americans to make decisions about their coverage. The deadline to sign up for health insurance through the ACA marketplace is Jan. 15 for most states. However, 10 states are offering an extended enrollment window to give residents extra time to select a plan.",
      "States with extended ACA enrollment deadlines, according to healthinsurance.org:",
      "California: Jan. 31Connecticut: Jan.\u00a0 31District of Columbia: Jan.\u00a0 31Massachusetts: Jan. 23Illinois: Jan. 31New Jersey: Jan. 31New York: Jan. 31Pennsylvania: Jan. 31Rhode Island: Jan. 31Virginia: Jan. 30",

      "Rhode Island: Jan. 31",
      "Virginia: Jan. 30",
      "For those yet to enroll in an ACA plan, the higher costs are sure to be a consideration. Nonprofit health group KFF previously estimated that, barring action by Congress, Obamacare\u00a0premiums\u00a0could more than double this year for the more than 20 million Americans who previously received the tax credits.",
      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",
      "Some people are dumping their ACA coverage due to steeper costs. Florida resident Stacy Kanas, 59, told CBS News that her family is dropping its ACA plan after learning that their premiums would spike.",
      "\"That is why we're not choosing to be covered at this time,\" she said. \"It's cost-prohibitive.\"",
      "ACA premiums for \"silver\" plans, the second lowest-cost Obamacare coverage, have jumped nearly 22% in 2026, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. By comparison, the nonpartisan think tank projected that health insurance costs for employer-sponsored plans would rise by no more than 7% this year.",
      "Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million people had enrolled in ACA marketplace plans as of Jan. 12, down 1.4 million from the number of Americans who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Can Congress extend the credits after open enrollment ends?",
      "Technically, there is no deadline for Congress to extend the ACA tax credits, leaving the door open for a congressional remedy, experts have noted.",
      "\"The ACA premium subsidies are refundable tax credits, which are calculated on an annual basis,\" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said in a December blog\u00a0post, \"So, an extension could happen even after the deadline to sign up for coverage and be made retroactive to January 1.\"",
      "If the credits are preserved, Levitt said state and federal ACA marketplaces would update their systems, and open enrollment would be extended to give people more time to sort through plan options. However, if a resolution comes later in the year, it could make matters more difficult, Levitt said.",
      "\"Any changes to the ACA tax credits mid-year would complicate the logistics and slow down the reopening of enrollment and the premium relief,\" he said in a post.",

    "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 19:38:13 -0500",
    "summary": "\"We have a fiduciary duty to Nippon,\" U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said, but noted, \"We're still mined, melted and made in the good ol' USA.\"",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Steel's acquisition last year by Japan's Nippon Steel came with a notable condition to win approval from the Trump administration: a so-called \"golden share\" that gives President Trump the power to approve certain major corporate decisions, including closing plants or changing locations. But CEO David Burritt tells CBS News, \"There's nothing in this golden share that prevents us from doing what we want to do.\"",
      "\"We're aligned with what the president wants us to do. In fact, we wouldn't agree to this thing if we weren't sure it was going to be great for our workers and great for our company,\" Burritt told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil at one of the company's plants in Pittsburgh.",
      "Burritt downplayed some of the provisions in the deal, saying there were certain aspects that would need approval, such as changing the company's name or being forced to follow existing trade laws, that don't have any impact on what U.S. Steel's plans were to begin with.",
      "But asked if the company would require Mr. Trump's approval for business decisions down the line, such as closing a plant, Burritt insisted, \"We don't see us closing the plant. In fact, we just did have an opening here because of demand increasing at Granite City [Illinois].\"",
      "Burritt said, despite Mr. Trump's own claims last year, that the president did not veto the company's decision to close down the Granite City operation, which had been dormant since 2023. He said the company recently restarted a blast furnace at the location due to increased customer demand.",
      "Burritt acknowledged that in the future, \"If we had to make a difficult business decision, we would have to get approval to close a plant.\"",
      "\"But we don't see a reason to do that,\" he added.",
      "\"We can't guarantee things are going to stay open,\" Burritt said. \"We are going to manage the business and we're going to keep a great relationship with this administration, who did so much for us and the United States, to help get this deal done.\"",
      "Burritt touted the acquisition, saying, \"Without the partnership, we would not be able to invest as much money as what we are now. ... This is really a wonderful thing for the workers, and the workers are the ones who made this happen.\"",
      "He also highlighted the $14 billion investment from the deal that, he says, the company will be spending in the coming years, supporting as many as \"100,000 direct or indirect jobs.\"",
      "Burritt said, despite the acquisition, U.S. Steel is \"absolutely\" still a U.S. company.",
      "\"U.S. Steel Corporation: That's our brand. That's our name. Headquartered right here in Pittsburgh, and we're gonna keep it there and continue to build here,\" he said.",
      "\"We have a fiduciary duty to national security. And we have a fiduciary duty to Nippon. We keep them aligned and it's a beautiful thing,\" he said, adding: \"We're still mined, melted and made in the good ol' USA.\"",
      "Burritt called Mr. Trump's tariffs a \"game changer,\" saying, \"We really appreciate that the tariffs are in place. This strengthens national security, economic security and also makes sure we have job security and creates jobs.\"",

    "story": [
      "As homeowners across the U.S. prepare to file their taxes this season, they may be wondering what deductions they qualify for and whether it's worth itemizing or sticking with the standard deduction.",
      "As in every tax season, a filer's situation will hinge on multiple factors.",
      "\"Everyone's situation is different,\" said Kate Wood, a lending expert from NerdWallet. \"It's hard to say kind of how everything is going to stack up for most homeowners, because so much will depend on your income and then also where you live.\"",
      "Still, it can pay \u2014 quite literally \u2014 to be prepared.",
      "The deductions available to homeowners are fairly consistent with years past, with a few changes following last year's passage of the Republicans' new tax and spending law.",
      "The IRS will start accepting tax returns on Jan. 26.",
      "What deductions can I claim as a homeowner?",
      "The mortgage interest deduction remains one of the chief tax breaks for homeowners.",
      "However, fewer people have claimed this since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which nearly doubled the size of the standard deduction, Wood said. Still, it remains an option for taxpayers who itemize \u2014 meaning they add up eligible expenses such as mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable donations, and claim them only if the combined total exceeds the standard deduction.",
      "The standard deduction for 2025 is $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly.",
      "Filers can deduct up to $750,000 of mortgage debt, or up to $375,000 for married people who file separately, according to the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Other common deductions for homeowners, according to NerdWallet, include:",
      "Home equity loan and home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest.\u00a0\u00a0Filers can only take this deduction if the money was spent on qualifying home improvements. \"Say you took out a home equity loan because you were trying to consolidate other debt, or something like that,\" Wood said. \"In that case, the interest would not be deductible.\"Home office expenses. People who are self-employed and who work from home can write off expenses they paid related to their business, including rent, utilities and real estate taxes. If you're a full-time employee who works from home but receives a W-2, you are not eligible for this deduction, according to NerdWallet.\u00a0Medically necessary home improvements.

      "What's new this year?",
      "There are two main changes this year for homeowners stemming from the \"big, beautiful bill\" act that President Trump signed into law last year.",
      "The first is the expansion of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The \"big, beautiful bill\" Act raises the cap from $10,000 to $40,000, allowing taxpayers to deduct up to $40,000 in combined property taxes and either state and local income taxes or sales taxes.",
      "Single filers can now deduct up to to $40,000, while married couples can deduct up to $20,000 each if they are filing separately. The deduction phases out for people with adjusted gross incomes over $500,000.",
      "The degree to which any given filer will benefit from the higher SALT cap will depend on where they live, the type of property they own and the amount they pay in property taxes, Wood said.",
      "\"If you're someone who has a large, high-interest-rate mortgage, and you're living in a high property tax area, you could potentially get a significant boost from itemizing,\" she said. \"But if you're someone who's paying low interest, has a modest mortgage, is in a lower tax location, the standard deduction might be just fine for you.\"",
      "The second major change homeowners should be aware of is the elimination of energy-focused\u00a0home improvement tax credits, which were phased out at the end of 2025 under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" The credits were intended to help taxpayers offset the cost of clean-energy upgrades, such as installing solar panels or improving insulation.",
      "To qualify for the credits this tax season, homeowners must have completed their energy upgrades in 2025, Wood said. \"Not just that you purchased the items, but that the work was completed by Dec. 31, 2025,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "A Georgia-based food company has recalled thousands of pounds of ready-to-eat chicken products, which were sold in seven different states, after determining the products may have been contaminated with listeria, the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u00a0announced.",
      "Suzanna's Kitchen, headquartered in Norcross, Georgia, recalled roughly 13,720 pounds of its ready-to-eat grilled chicken breast fillet products, according to the Food Safety and Inspection Service, a branch of the Department of Agriculture.",
      "The recalled products were produced on Oct. 14, 2025, and sold in 10-pound cases containing two 5-pound bags of cooked grilled chicken breast fillets with rib meat, health officials said. They were sent to distribution centers for food service sales in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Ohio.",
      "There have been no confirmed reports of illness linked to the consumption of the recalled products. Officials said the problem was discovered by a third-party laboratory, which tested the chicken fillets and reported a positive result for Listeria monocytogenes, a type of disease-causing bacteria that can infect people when they eat food that has been contaminated with it.",
      "The bacteria can be found in a number of places, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including soil, water, sewage, vegetation and animals. It can survive and grow even when products it contaminates are refrigerated, and is generally transmitted when food is \"harvested, processed, prepared, packed, transported, or stored in manufacturing or production environments contaminated with L. monocytogenes,\" the FDA says.",
      "Listeria infections are the third-leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimates that 1,250 people contract the infection each year and 172 people die from it.",
      "Although no illnesses have been reported in connection with the recalled products from Suzanna's Kitchen, officials have encouraged anyone with concerns to contact a healthcare provider.",

    "published": "Sat, 17 Jan 2026 07:00:13 -0500",
    "summary": "As the president prepares to replace Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, he's made no secret of his goal for lower interest rates \u2014 but there are a few political roadblocks in the way.",
    "story": [
      "As President Trump prepares to nominate a new Federal Reserve chair in the coming months, he hasn't been shy about his goal for the powerful economic posting: lower interest rates.",
      "\"I want somebody that when the market is doing great, interest rates can go down because our country becomes stronger,\" the president said during a speech in Detroit on Tuesday. He's long pushed for lower rates, which could boost economic growth and make it cheaper to borrow.",
      "He has also made no secret of his frustration with outgoing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who has supported cutting interest rates at a fairly slow clip, wary of causing inflation to resurge. For months, Mr. Trump has called Powell \u2014 whom the president appointed Fed chief during his first term \u2014 a \"moron,\" a \"stubborn mule,\" a \"real stiff\" and \"Mr. Too Late.\"",
      "And then, in a surprising Sunday night video message, Powell announced the Fed had received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department \"threatening a criminal indictment\" over Powell's testimony to Congress about a pricey renovation to the Fed's headquarters. He accused the administration of using the renovation cost overruns and his testimony as \"pretexts.\" He also argued the independence of the Fed, which operates separately from the executive branch and isn't funded by tax dollars, is at risk.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said, asserting that this threat \"is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions \u2014 or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.\"",
      "The White House says Mr. Trump didn't direct the Justice Department to issue subpoenas, and U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro has insisted the subpoenas were \"not a threat,\" but were instead issued because the Fed wasn't answering questions. In an interview with CBS News, Mr. Trump brushed off allegations of political retribution, saying: \"I can't help what it looks like.\"",
      "But the subpoenas have outraged some Republican lawmakers, jeopardizing Mr. Trump's plan to immediately nominate a new Fed chair when Powell's term ends in May.",
      "That congressional pushback is just the latest roadblock in Mr. Trump's quest to get the Fed to cut rates. There's also the looming possibility that Powell could remain on the Federal Reserve's board even after his term as chair ends. And ultimately, the decisions on interest rates are made by a committee that's largely out of the president's reach.",
      "\"As we learned this week, [Mr. Trump] may not have as much freedom to pick a Fed chair as he thought,\" David Wessel, director of the Brookings Institution's Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy, told CBS News.",
      "New Fed chair will need to get through a skeptical Senate",
      "Mr. Trump has identified two leading candidates to replace Powell as Fed chair: White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett and former Fed board member Kevin Warsh.",
      "\"The two Kevins are very good,\" the president told Reuters.",
      "But the next chair will need to be confirmed by the Senate \u2014 and there are signs the Justice Department's investigation into Powell could complicate things, as several GOP lawmakers have raised concerns that the Fed's delicate independence may be at risk.",
      "Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina reacted furiously to the Powell probe, writing on X that Trump advisers were \"actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve.\"",
      "\"I will oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed\u2014including the upcoming Fed Chair vacancy\u2014until this legal matter is fully resolved,\" Tillis wrote just hours after Powell publicly announced the subpoenas.",
      "Tillis sits on the Senate Banking Committee, and if he were to vote with the panel's Democrats to oppose Mr. Trump's nominee, the committee would deadlock 12-12.",
      "Any nominee who makes it to the full Senate could face skepticism from several other Senate Republicans. In the current Senate, Mr. Trump can afford to lose only three GOP votes if all Democrats vote against his Federal Reserve pick.",
      "Among the GOP skeptics: Sen. Susan Collins of Maine told reporters that Powell's video revealing the subpoenas raised \"a lot of disturbing questions,\" and Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said she sees the investigation as a bid to \"intimidate, threaten and coerce.\" Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana said he thinks it's unlikely that Powell did anything wrong and warned the conflict between Mr. Trump and the Fed chief could be economically damaging.",
      "\"If you wanted to design a system to cause interest rates to go up and not down, you would have the Federal Reserve of the United States and the executive branch of the United States get into a pissing contest. We don't need it,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who has the ability to bypass a deadlocked Banking Committee and enable a nominee to reach the floor for a vote, acknowledged to reporters Monday that the investigation could make it challenging to confirm new nominees to the Fed.",
      "\"If the Justice Department is pursuing something, I hope they have a smoking gun or something, because I don't think you trifle with the Federal Reserve,\" the South Dakota Republican said Tuesday.",
      "What if Powell doesn't step down?",
      "Another possible wrinkle: Powell's term as Fed chair expires in May, but his term as a rank-and-file member of the Fed's Board of Governors doesn't end for another two years.",
      "All seven members of the board serve 14-year terms, but the board's chair serves a separate four-year term. In recent history, most Fed chairs have resigned from the board altogether when their time as boss runs out, but there's nothing requiring them to do so.",
      "Powell has served on the Fed since 2012. He was nominated to a 14-year term by former President Barack Obama two years later, was elevated to chair during Mr. Trump's first term and was nominated to a second term as chair by former President Joe Biden. The 72-year-old Powell hasn't said whether he plans to leave the Fed when his term as chair expires.",
      "Murkowski told reporters Monday that if the goal of the scrutiny on Powell is to get him to speed up his departure from the Fed, it could have the opposite effect.",
      "\"When you get pressured, when you get threatened in this way, most of us would say, 'I'm not going anywhere,'\" she said.",
      "Wessel told CBS News he doesn't think Powell is likely to stay on the Fed board, but said: \"I do think there's a possibility, and I think the possibility went up over the last week.\"",
      "If Powell decides to stick around until his term ends in January 2028, it could cause a few problems for Mr. Trump's push for a Fed that aligns with his views on interest rates.",
      "Because the new Fed chair must be selected from among the existing seven Fed governors, there needs to be a vacancy on the board in order for Mr. Trump to appoint a new person as chair. If Powell doesn't create a vacancy by resigning, the president would likely need to nominate his chair to the board seat currently occupied by Stephen Miran.",
      "A Trump economic adviser, Miran was confirmed to a short-term posting on the Fed board last year after a Biden-nominated governor resigned before her term expired. His term as a Fed governor ends on Jan. 31, but it's not clear if Mr. Trump had planned to nominate him to a fresh 14-year term after that. (If a successor to Miran isn't nominated when his current term ends, he can remain in place until the Senate confirms a replacement, under federal law.)",
      "If Mr. Trump replaces Miran with his handpicked Fed chair and Powell remains on the board, only three of the Fed's seven governors would be Trump nominees: the chair, plus two officials who were initially appointed during Mr. Trump's first term, Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller.",
      "That could increase to four Trump nominees out of seven after Powell's term ends in 2028. But the three remaining governors \u2014 all Biden nominees \u2014 have terms that end in 2032 or later, keeping them on the Fed until well after Mr. Trump leaves office unless they choose to resign.",
      "Chair doesn't set interest rates on his own",
      "The composition of the Fed's rank-and-file board members matters for Mr. Trump because, when it comes to interest rate-setting decisions, the chair is technically one vote out of a dozen.",
      "Interest rate policy is overseen by a 12-member panel called the Federal Open Market Committee, which is made up of all seven Fed governors, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a rotating cast of four of the other 11 regional Fed bank chiefs.",
      "Mr. Trump has very little control over the regional Fed presidents who sit on the committee. They're hired for five-year terms by each regional bank's board of directors, and while the Fed's Board of Governors needs to approve their appointments, the board voted unanimously to extend most sitting regional bank presidents' terms until 2031 last month. Wessel said the board can fire presidents.",
      "So, depending on whether Powell stays on the Fed, either three or four of the Federal Open Market Committee's 12 members are set to be Trump nominees.",
      "When the committee meets eight times a year to set interest rate targets, the Fed chair traditionally plays a key role in helping the panel form consensus, but the members vote on their own. It's not uncommon for members to dissent from the committee's decisions, and there's no guarantee that their views will align with Mr. Trump's.",
      "\"If they don't respect the chairman, and the chairman bows to pressure from Trump and wants to do a deep interest rate cut that the other members of the committee think is nuts, they will vote against it,\" Wessel said.",
      "Dissents have been commonplace in recent months. When the committee voted to leave rates flat in July, Bowman and Waller pushed for a rate cut \u2014 but their stance hinged on a belief that the economy is softening, not that it's extremely strong as Mr. Trump argues. And in December, when the committee voted to cut rates by 0.25 points, Miran dissented and called for a larger 0.5-point cut, while two regional presidents favored no cut at all.",
      "And if Powell stays on as a Fed governor, Wessell said he could have \"considerable influence,\" too.",
      "Can Trump fire Fed officials?",
      "Mr. Trump is fighting in court for an extra board seat \u2014 and for more power to shape the board.",
      "Over the summer, the president attempted to fire board member Lisa Cook, accusing the Biden nominee of making false statements on mortgage documents.",
      "The dramatic move posed the first-ever test of a president's power to fire Fed members. Under federal law, the president can only remove board members \"for cause,\" a term that isn't defined.",
      "Cook has sued over the firing, arguing that an \"unsubstantiated allegation about private mortgage applications\" doesn't meet the law's requirement for cause. But the Trump administration has argued the president acted within his power.",
      "The Supreme Court is hearing arguments in Cook's case on Jan. 21. The courts have let Cook remain in her job \u2014 and vote on interest rate policy \u2014 while the lawsuit plays out, but the federal government is asking the Supreme Court to allow her to be removed for the time being.",
      "It's not clear how the high court might rule. In a separate case that's also set to be decided this term, the Supreme Court appears to be leaning toward giving the president more power to fire members of independent government agencies without cause. But the court has hinted in the past that it views the Federal Reserve as special.",
      "In an order last year that let Mr. Trump fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Supreme Court explicitly said that the Fed wouldn't be impacted, calling it a \"uniquely structured, quasi-private entity that follows in the distinct historical tradition of the First and Second Banks of the United States.\"",
      "The case could have broad implications for whether the Fed remains independent.",
      "Mr. Trump has long argued that he should have some input in the Fed's interest rate-setting decisions, saying last month that \"my voice should be heard\" because of his business background.",
      "But many experts say it's essential that the Fed operate independently of political influence so that it can weigh the economy's long-term best interest, rather than accommodating politicians' short-term desire for low rates and a hot economy.",
      "\"I think the expectations are [that] the Supreme Court doesn't want to turn the Fed inside out and they're going to let [Cook] stay,\" Wessel said. \"If they didn't let her stay, that would basically be the end of the independence of the Federal Reserve.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is delaying its plans to withhold pay from student loan borrowers who default on their payments, backing off a measure that threatened to deliver a financial blow to millions of Americans.",
      "The Education Department announced Friday that involuntary collections on federal student loans will remain on hold as the agency finalizes new repayment plans. The shift reverses course on earlier plans to restart wage garnishments this month after a pandemic-era pause.",
      "Nicholas Kent, the department's higher education chief, said the agency is \"committed to helping student and parent borrowers resume regular, on-time repayment, with more clear and affordable options.\"",
      "\"The Department determined that involuntary collection efforts such as Administrative Wage Garnishment and the Treasury Offset Program will function more efficiently and fairly after the Trump Administration implements significant improvements to our broken student loan system,\" Kent said in a statement.",
      "Federal student loan borrowers can have their wages garnished and their federal tax refunds withheld if they default on their loans, meaning they are at least 270 days behind on payments. The penalties were put on hold during a pandemic-era pause on student loan payments that the Trump administration lifted.",
      "Last spring, Trump officials said they would resume targeting tax refunds for borrowers in default. In December, officials said they would restart wage garnishment in January, with initial notices being sent to 1,000 borrowers the week of Jan. 7.",
      "Both penalties \u2014 withholding wages and federal payments \u2014 are being paused, according to the Friday announcement.",
      "The department did not set a new date for involuntary collections. It said the delay will give borrowers time to evaluate new repayment plans that are scheduled to be available starting July 1.",
      "Secretary of Education Linda McMahon indicated earlier this week that the department was planning to pause wage garnishment efforts in remarks to local reporters in Rhode Island.",
      "More than 5 million Americans were in default on their federal student loans as of September, according to department data. Millions more have fallen behind on loan payments and are at risk of going into default this year. Nearly 10% of borrowers were delinquent by more than 90 days in the third quarter of 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "Payments on student loans were paused from March 2020 to April 2023, and for a one-year grace period after that, borrowers who missed payments could avoid default. The Education Department announced in May that it would resume collections activity.",
      "McMahon said earlier this week that \"we had an incredible falloff in people repaying their loans\" during the pandemic-era pause.",
      "Friday's announcement was welcomed by student loan advocates who urged the department not to resume wage garnishment.",
      "\"The administration's plans would have been economically reckless and would have risked pushing nearly 9 million defaulted borrowers even further into debt,\" Aissa Canchola Ba\u00f1ez, policy director at the nonprofit Protect Borrowers, told the Associated Press.",
      "Congress last year ordered the department to overhaul repayment plans that critics said had become too confusing. New borrowers will have two options: a standard plan and a plan that lowers payments based on the borrower's income.",
      "Last month the department scrapped the SAVE Plan, which was created under former President Joe Biden and offered lower payments and a quicker path to student loan forgiveness. The plan had been blocked by a federal judge after Missouri and other states challenged it in court.",

      "The Trump administration says it has completed the first sale of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. \u2014 a shipment the president valued at $500 million.",
      "It's part of the administration's push to tap into Venezuela's oil reserves, some of the largest in the world.",
      "What does that mean for U.S. drivers?",
      "Gas is currently at $2.67 a gallon nationally, the lowest it's been since May 2021. But prices have been steadily declining since last November, weeks before the U.S. military operation\u00a0that captured Venezuela's autocratic leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",

      "\"It's far too early for any measurable impact on what consumers are paying at the pump \u2014 whether prices go up or down \u2014 as it would likely take years to see a meaningful increase in oil output there,\" wrote Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, in their weekly price update.",
      "In 2024, the U.S. imported nearly 3.1 billion barrels of crude oil, and just 2.75% came from Venezuela. Even before 2019 sanctions, Venezuelan oil made up roughly 8% of yearly U.S. imports \u2014 about the same share Mexico holds today.",
      "In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Venezuela supplied 1 to 1.8 million barrels per day to the United States. Now the country's current production caps at 750,000 barrels per day.",
      "Returning to that higher level of production, if possible, wouldn't necessarily be a good thing for the global oil supply chain.",
      "\"A big ramp-up in production from Venezuela would sort of add to an already oversupplied market,\" said Lange.",
      "In any case, that ramp-up in production hasn't happened yet.\u00a0Venezuela's oil infrastructure\u00a0has suffered from years of underinvestment, corruption and sanctions, and so far, U.S. companies appear\u00a0reluctant to invest\u00a0in rebuilding it.",
      "\"It could take years of positive developments for additional supply to meaningfully move the needle,\" said De Haan. \"The impact on U.S. gasoline prices may ultimately be limited.\"",
      "Over the past decade, Canadian crude has dominated U.S. heavy oil imports while sanctions have virtually ceased Venezuelan shipments.",
      "Canada now supplies the majority of the heavy crude that American refineries need.",
      "\"It's certainly possible that a large increase in the oil coming out of Venezuela outcompetes Canadian oil, even as most of our refineries are going to be in the Gulf Coast,\" Lange said.",
      "But Lange says Venezuela is not ready to compete in that way right now. It depends on concessions from the Venezuelan government to U.S. energy producers.",
      "Why the U.S. needs heavy crude oil",
      "The U.S. is one of the world's largest oil producers. So why Import billions of barrels per year?",
      "It comes down to the type of oil. The U.S. produces mostly \"light crude,\" which is less dense and cheaper to refine. But American refineries, especially those along the Gulf Coast, are designed to process a mix of light and heavy crude.",
      "\"Most of our production of crude oil in the United States is on the light side, and most refineries need a mix of light and heavy,\" Lange said. \"Right now, we get a lot of our heavies from Canada, which may be supplemented by Venezuela in the near future.\"",
      "Venezuela's oil reserves total roughly 300 billion barrels \u2014 about 17% of the world's proven reserves. Much of it is heavy rude, exactly what Gulf Coast refineries need.",
      "If Venezuela can ramp up production, it could mean competition with Canada \u2014 and that's good for consumers, according to Lange.",
      "\"Refineries would pay less as they play the Canadians and the Venezuelans off each other,\" Lange said. \"And that would lead to a lower price of refined products for the end consumer.\"",
      "Can prices drop too low?",
      "More oil sounds good for drivers. But flooding an already oversupplied market carries risks.",
      "If crude prices fall too far, American producers start to cut back. Light crude \u2014 the kind that the U.S. produces \u2014 would become less profitable to drill. The going price for a barrel of oil, roughly 42 gallons, is just over $60.",
      "Experts caution scaling back would mean closing down refineries and cutting industry jobs in places like Texas and the Dakotas.",
      "\"If we don't import crude, we'd close a refinery. And that's not good,\" Lange said. \"That's jobs and economic activity.\"",
      "The cycle of supply and demand continues. If domestic production slows, supply tightens and prices rise again.",

    "story": [
      "OpenAI announced Friday that it will begin testing ads on ChatGPT in the coming weeks, opening the door to another potential revenue stream for the AI company in addition to its subscription-based models.",
      "The ads will appear at the bottom of the chat window \"when there's a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.",
      "In one example shared by the AI company, a user asks for authentic Mexican dish recommendations. ChatGPT responds with ideas for carne asada and pollo al carbon dishes and then links to a grocery brand advertising hot sauce.",
      "Only adults who use the free version of ChatGPT, or ChatGPT Go, a new low-cost subscription plan OpenAI announced Friday, will be shown ads. Higher-tier subscriptions, including Pro, which now costs $200 a month, will not include ads, OpenAI said.",
      "Asked how long the ad testing phase will last, and whether it has plans to scale the use of ads, an OpenAI spokesperson told CBS News, \"We will look at early user feedback and quality signals to see if early testing meets our bar before expanding.\"",
      "The AI company said the ads will not influence the answers ChatGPT provides and that it will not share conversations users have with the chatbot \u2014 or their data \u2014 with advertisers.",
      "The OpenAI spokesperson did not disclose the companies it intends to advertise on ChatGPT but said the company will \"have more to share about our early partners soon.\"",
      "OpenAI framed the introduction of the ads as a way to keep the free and low-cost versions of the chatbot accessible to more users.",
      "\"Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong, and we believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone,\" OpenAI said in its blog post.",
      "The AI company, which launched ChatGPT in 2022, is valued at $500 billion, but hasn't turned a profit yet, CNBC reported in November. The additional cash flow generated from ads could help ChatGPT invest in its growth and fund ongoing expenses, Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "Airlines could have weight loss drug manufacturers to thank for savings if passengers become lighter, allowing carriers to spend less money on fuel.",
      "As GLP-1 medications for weight loss become accessible to more Americans, they are expected to have a slimming down effect on society. The implication for airlines is lower fuel consumption and therefore cost savings, a recent analysis from Jefferies Research Services shows.",
      "Fuel costs are directly related to the weight of planes, including passengers, their luggage and other essential cargo. A heavier plane requires more fuel, while a lighter aircraft uses less.",
      "Airlines have always taken steps to keep aircraft as light as possible and limit fuel consumption, from serving pit-less olives to using thin or light paper stock, according to the Jefferies analysis.",
      "Airlines \"have a long history of searching for unique methods to reduce the weight of the aircraft, in turn reducing fuel consumption and limiting an airline's largest cost bucket,\" analysts said in the report.",
      "They have no ability to limit how much passengers weigh, however.",
      "If weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy lead to a 10% slimmer society, the analysts found that would translate to total airline passenger weight declining by 2%. For airlines, this means 1.5% in fuel savings, plus a 4% boost to earnings per share, according to the analysis.",
      "Jefferies used the example of a Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft to model the savings. It weighs 99,000 pounds empty and can carry 46,000 pounds of fuel. If it seats 178 passengers with an average weight of 180 pounds, plus about 4,000 pounds of other cargo, its total takeoff weight reaches 181,200 pounds. By contrast, if passengers slim down by 10%, to weigh an average of 162 pounds, that aircraft's total weight drops to 177,996 pounds.",
      "Jefferies found that translates to $580 million in fuel savings annually for the top four carriers in the U.S. \u2014 American, Delta, Southwest and United. Those airlines are expected to spend $38.6 billion combined on jet fuel this year.",
      "Jefferies  conducted the study in response to pharmaceutical companies developing weight loss pills\u00a0and following a 2023 report it released studying the effects of weight loss on fuel costs.",

    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:25:11 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump's plans to ease the financial pressures on Americans are bold but could backfire, experts said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is taking aim at three major pillars of the U.S. financial system \u2014 the Federal Reserve, the credit card industry and the housing market \u2014 that together wield enormous influence over Americans' finances.",
      "The efforts, announced separately over the past week, are tied to President Trump's push to lower borrowing costs as consumers grapple with inflation and affordability pressures. Specifically, Mr. Trump has floated a ban on\u00a0institutional investors\u00a0buying single-family homes, and also capping credit card interest rates at 10% for one year. The Department of Justice launched an\u00a0investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, a probe that Powell said is a pretext for weakening the Fed's independence in setting interest rates.",
      "Although experts note that such measures could reduce borrowing costs for everything from mortgages to credit cards, economists warn they also risk backfiring \u2014 potentially reigniting inflation, restricting access to credit and undermining confidence in the U.S. financial system.",
      "\"Increasing affordability is a worthy goal of this administration, but none of the policies on the table are going to achieve that,\" said Nick Anthony, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Cato Institute, where he focuses on monetary policy.",
      "He added, \"In fact, most of them are likely to hurt consumers more than they will help them, whether it be price controls, intervening in the Federal Reserve, or intervening in the housing market. All of these interventions are more likely to distort the market than actually help it.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, White House spokesman Davis Ingle said Mr. Trump will unveil more details about his plans for making homes more affordable at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, which starts on January 19.",
      "\"President Trump is committed to making it easier and more affordable to achieve the American Dream of homeownership by eliminating unnecessary red tape, increasing supply and lowering costs. President Trump is working tirelessly to undo the severe damage the Biden Administration inflicted on the American people through high prices,\" Ingle said.",
      "The White House referred questions about the Powell investigation to the Justice Department, which didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Risks of targeting Powell",
      "President Trump has grown\u00a0increasingly critical of Powell, regularly pressing him to lower interest rates and questioning his economic judgment.",
      "Powell does not set rates alone. As a member of the Federal Open Market Committee, he is one of 12 officials whose majority vote determines whether the Fed cuts, raises or holds interest rates steady.",
      "The latest effort by the Trump administration to target Powell comes after the Fed lowered its benchmark rate three times since September, with Powell citing easing inflation and a slowing labor market as justification for the cuts. Powell has long stressed that the Fed bases its rate decisions on economic data, emphasizing the central bank's traditional independence from political influence.",
      "On Sunday, Powell linked the Justice Department to efforts to undermine the Fed's independence when setting interest rates.",
      "\"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the President,\" Powell said in a statement.",
      "Research has found that countries where central banks are more vulnerable to political influence have suffered from economic problems such as runaway inflation.",
      "It's important that \"the Federal Reserve can act as it sees fit, and it can make the decisions that it believes to be right without fearing repercussions,\" Cato's Anthony said. \"And when you do fear those repercussions, that's when we see situations where there's hyperinflation abroad, because the only concern was making sure that the leader, whether elected or authoritarian, was presented in the best light possible.\"",
      "Borrowing costs could decline if the White House is successful in pressuring Fed officials to lower interest rates, but the flip side could be surging inflation, noted Nigel Green of investment advisory firm deVere Group.",
      "Any legal action against Powell also could undermine investor confidence in U.S. monetary policy, weakening the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency and destabilizing the bond market, Wall Street analysts said.",
      "\"The Fed must remain independent in order for the central bank to remain effective and \u2014 this is important \u2014 for the integrity of the U.S. dollar and the all-important Treasury markets to remain the world's benchmarks,\" said Mark Malek, CIO at Siebert Financial, in an email.",
      "Unintended consequences?",
      "Americans have about $1.2 trillion in outstanding credit card debt, with lenders charging an average APR of about 23.8%, according to LendingTree.",
      "On Friday, Mr. Trump called for a one-year cap of 10% on credit card rates, writing in a social media post that he \"will no longer let the American Public be 'ripped off' by Credit Card Companies.\"",
      "Cutting credit card rates by more than half could save Americans $100 billion in interest annually, Vanderbilt University researchers\u00a0said in a September report.",
      "But a 10% cap could also have adverse consequences, experts added. Credit card companies would likely reduce credit for more than 80% of customers, with almost every account for people with credit scores below 740 closed or severely restricted to offset the reduced fees from a 10% cap, according to an analysis from the Electronic Payments Coalition, a financial industry trade group.",
      "Credit card spending also accounts for 30% to 40% of total annual consumer spending, so tighter credit for lower-income Americans could reduce overall consumer spending by roughly 5% \u2014 a significant economic hit, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.",
      "Housing's biggest problem",
      "Lastly, Mr. Trump is tackling housing affordability at a time when homeownership is increasingly out of reach for many Americans.",
      "His approach aims to tackle two core issues with the housing market \u2014 higher mortgage rates and competition for homes \u2014 by directing the federal government to\u00a0purchase $200 billion in mortgage bonds\u00a0and banning institutional investors from buying single-family homes.",
      "On Friday, the average rate for a 30-year mortgage dipped below 6%, its lowest level in three years. But experts said the strategies fail to address the housing market's biggest problem \u2014 a lack of available homes that stems from underbuilding after the Great Recession.",
      "\"The affordability crisis is fundamentally a supply problem, and meaningful relief requires adding homes, both through new construction or through inventory gains in chronically constrained markets, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest,\" said Realtor.com senior economist Jake Krimmel in an email.",
      "For that reason, banning institutional investors from single-family home purchases \"is unlikely to move the needle on affordability,\" he concluded.",
      "The lack of supply to meet demand from buyers is an issue that will take years to resolve, experts said.",
      "To be sure, banning institutional investors could help reduce competition for homes in some markets. Institutional investors account for roughly 1% of total single-family housing stock, according to an August analysis by researchers at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan think tank. The study defined such investors as those owning at least 100 properties.",
      "Investors are a bigger presence in some regions, with investors owning about 27% of single-family rental properties in Atlanta, The Hamilton Project at Brookings found in a 2023\u00a0study.",
      "As of mid-2025, meanwhile, about 10% of home purchases were made by investors, with most them \"mom-and-pop\" buyers, according to Realtor.com said.",

      "Later, he said at the news conference that the system may give way at least in part to country-to-country or regional agreements rather than the global ones that have underpinned economic growth in the post-World War II era.",
      "\"The question is: What gets built in that place? How much of a patchwork is it?\" he said.",
      "The new reality reflects in large part the so-called America-first approach of Mr. Trump. The tariffs he has imposed have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, who has met with several leading Chinese companies in Beijing, said ahead of his trip that his government is focused on building an economy less reliant on the U.S. at what he called \"a time of global trade disruption.\"",
      "A Canadian business owner in China called Carney's visit game-changing, saying it re-establishes dialogue, respect and a framework between the two nations.",
      "\"These three things we didn't have,\" said Jacob Cooke, the CEO of WPIC Marketing + Technologies, which helps exporters navigate the Chinese market. \"The parties were not talking for years.\"",
      "Canada had been aligned with U.S. on tariffs",
      "Canada had followed the U.S. in putting tariffs of 100% on EVs from China and 25% on steel and aluminum under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Carney's predecessor.",
      "China responded by imposing duties of 100% on Canadian canola oil and meal and 25% on pork and seafood. It added a 75.8% tariff on canola seeds last August. Collectively, the import taxes effectively closed the Chinese market to Canadian canola, an industry group has said. Overall, China's imports from Canada fell 10.4% last year to $41.7 billion, according to Chinese trade data.",
      "Carney tried to address the concerns of Canadian automakers and autoworkers by saying the initial cap on Chinese EV imports was about 3% of the 1.8 million vehicles sold in Canada annually and that, in exchange, China is expected to begin investing in the Canadian auto industry within three years.",
      "More than half of the Chinese EVs exported to Canada would have an import price of less than 35,000 Canadian dollars ($25,000) within five years, he said, making them accessible to consumers.",
      "\"We're building (a) new part of our car industry, building cars of the future in partnership, bringing affordable autos for Canadians at a time when affordability is top of mind, and doing it at a scale that allows for a smooth transition in the sector,\" he said.",
      "\"For the exchange of a small piece of the Canadian market, we have a commitment. We are waiting for an investment commitment in Canada. The real leaders of the new industry. So it's an agreement that will create the future for our industry.\"",
      "China sees an opening under Trump",
      "China is hoping Mr. Trump's pressure tactics on allies such as Canada will drive them to pursue a foreign policy that is less aligned with the United States.",
      "Carney, though, noted Canada's relationship with the U.S. is much more multifaceted, deeper and broader. Canada and China have different systems and disagree on issues such as human rights, he said, limiting the scope of their engagement even as they seek ways to cooperate on areas of common interest.",
      "The Canadian leader leaves China on Saturday and visits Qatar on Sunday before attending the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland next week. He will meet business leaders and investors in Qatar to promote trade and investment, his office said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bankruptcy-filing-rise-consumer-business-epiq/",
    "published": "Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:05:34 -0500",
    "summary": "The increase in bankruptcy filings comes as Americans face a slate of economic pressures, from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "New data shows more Americans are filing for bankruptcy, the latest indication that\u00a0price pressures\u00a0and an uneven economy are leaving some households strapped for cash.",
      "Total consumer bankruptcy filings jumped 12% from 478,752 in 2024 to 533,949 in 2025, according to Epiq AACER, a platform that provides U.S. bankruptcy filing data. Epiq, which tracks Chapter 7, Chapter 11 and Chapter 13 filings, relies on data provided through the U.S. Courts' PACER system, an electronic database that houses federal court records.",
      "The surge in filings comes as American consumers \u2014 and businesses \u2014 face a slate of economic pressures, ranging from sticky inflation to elevated borrowing costs, experts told CBS News.",
      "John Rao, a senior attorney with the National Consumer Law Center, said Americans typically hold off on filing for bankruptcy as long as they can, meaning the conditions that led them to file for bankruptcy may not necessarily be tied to current economic issues.",
      "\"There is often a lag before economic conditions translate to higher bankruptcies,\" he said.",
      "Still, he said the rising cost of medical insurance, mounting credit card debt and the restart of student loan repayments are serving as some of the major catalysts for bankruptcies. Inflation has also made it tougher for Americans to cover expenses while paying down their debt, he added. Inflation has cooled since hitting a 40-year high in 2022, but prices are still rising faster than the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target.",
      "\"There comes a point where the mounting bills, the increasing balances on credit cards, all those things just weigh people down so much,\" Rao said.",
      "A\u00a0December CBS News poll\u00a0found most Americans are struggling to afford basic living costs in the U.S., including health care, food and housing.",
      "A bankruptcy filing can provide consumers with a financial reset, stopping collection calls and wiping out some or all of their debt. But the relief comes with trade-offs: Bankruptcy can severely damage a credit score, delay the ability to buy a home and make it tougher to qualify for loans in the future.",
      "Still, the process may be more common than you think: One in 10 Americans files for bankruptcy at some point during their lifetime, according to a 2025 LendingTree report.",
      "Commercial filings drift higher",
      "Commercial bankruptcies are also on the rise, with filings up 5% from 2024 to 2025, according to Epiq AACER's data. In 2025, consumers lost a number of national and regional retailers \u2014 including Forever 21 and Joann Fabrics \u2014 that failed to stay afloat even after seeking bankruptcy protection.",
      "Chapter 11 bankruptcies, which allow companies to restructure their finances, were up just 1% from 2024 to 2025, driven by higher interest rates in 2023 and 2024 along with inflation, according to Christopher Ward, the co-chair of bankruptcy and restructuring at Polsinelli Law Firm.",
      "Among the most notable recent filings is Saks Global, which filed for Chapter 11 on Wednesday. The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman said it has secured financing that will allow it to keep stores open as the bankruptcy proceeds.",
      "Pre-pandemic normalization",
      "Experts emphasized that the increase in commercial and consumer bankruptcies represents a return to pre-pandemic norms.",
      "Bankruptcies dipped during COVID as an injection of government funding helped prop up cash-strapped businesses and American households. Forbearance plans also gave some mortgage payers and car owners more financial breathing room, said Michael Hunter, vice president of Epiq AACER.",
      "However, once those temporary relief measures faded, bankruptcy filings drifted higher, with data showing an upward trend since 2022.",
      "\"We're just slowly coming back to pre-COVID levels,\" Hunter said. \"Is it a huge event? No. Is it a big increase from what we've experienced over the past five years? Yes.\"",
      "While the overall number of bankruptcies is still below their pre-COVID levels, they could start to accelerate, Rao told CBS News.",
      "\"There's a good chance that filings will even be higher through this year and even into next year,\" he said.",

      "Christy Bunce, president of mortgage lender New American Funding, told CBS News that more prospective buyers entering the market would drive up home prices.\u00a0 \"But I don't think we are in a market where we're going to see crazy appreciation,\" she added.",

    "story": [
      "As the window for Americans to enroll in an Affordable Care Act health plan closes in most states today, millions of Americans remain in limbo as Congress weighs whether to extend tax subsidies designed to lower the cost of Obamacare insurance.",
      "Congress has been locked in a showdown for months over the fate of the enhanced ACA premium tax credits, which\u00a0expired on Dec. 31. The\u00a0fight over the subsidies\u00a0was central to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which dragged on for six weeks.",
      "The House\u00a0approved a measure\u00a0last week to extend the tax credits for three years after 17 Republicans joined Democrats in forcing a vote on the issue. Yet the extension faces an uphill climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, which previously rejected a separate plan to extend the credits for three years.",
      "A bipartisan group of lawmakers is working on a compromise that includes a two-year extension of the ACA subsidies, but GOP senators said Thursday that progress has stalled.",
      "Separately, President Trump on Thursday announced a health care proposal\u00a0that the White House said would \"send money directly to the American people, lower health insurance premiums and cut kickbacks that raise insurance premiums.\"",
      "In the meantime, the clock is ticking for Americans to make decisions about their coverage. The deadline to sign up for health insurance through the ACA marketplace is Jan. 15 for most states. However, 10 states are offering an extended enrollment window to give residents extra time to select a plan.",

      "For those yet to enroll in an ACA plan, the higher costs are sure to be a consideration. Nonprofit health group KFF previously estimated that, barring action by Congress, Obamacare\u00a0premiums\u00a0could more than double this year for the more than 20 million Americans who previously received the tax credits.",
      "\"The end of open enrollment in many states and the most recent enrollment numbers confirm what people across the country are already feeling: We are in a health care affordability crisis,\" said Michelle Sternthal, interim senior director of policy and strategy at Community Catalyst, a health care advocacy group. \"When Congress failed to extend the enhanced premium tax credits, premiums spiked overnight.\"",
      "Some people are dumping their ACA coverage due to steeper costs. Florida resident Stacy Kanas, 59, told CBS News that her family is dropping its ACA plan after learning that their premiums would spike.",
      "\"That is why we're not choosing to be covered at this time,\" she said. \"It's cost-prohibitive.\"",
      "ACA premiums for \"silver\" plans, the second lowest-cost Obamacare coverage, have jumped nearly 22% in 2026, according to a recent analysis by the Urban Institute. By comparison, the nonpartisan think tank projected that health insurance costs for employer-sponsored plans would rise by no more than 7% this year.",
      "Data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services shows 22.8 million people had enrolled in ACA marketplace plans as of Jan. 12, down 1.4 million from the number of Americans who had enrolled in Obamacare, as the health plans are known, a year ago.",
      "Can Congress extend the credits after open enrollment ends?",
      "Technically, there is no deadline for Congress to extend the ACA tax credits, leaving the door open for a congressional remedy, experts have noted.",
      "\"The ACA premium subsidies are refundable tax credits, which are calculated on an annual basis,\" Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, said in a December blog\u00a0post, \"So, an extension could happen even after the deadline to sign up for coverage and be made retroactive to January 1.\"",
      "If the credits are preserved, Levitt said state and federal ACA marketplaces would update their systems, and open enrollment would be extended to give people more time to sort through plan options. However, if a resolution comes later in the year, it could make matters more difficult, Levitt said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republican senators said Thursday that a long-sought bipartisan compromise to extend the expired Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits for two years has stalled.",
      "\"We are in a little bit of a pothole,\" GOP Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio said, blaming Democratic leaders for the lack of movement on the issue. \"So for me, I'm going to take a pause until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader and his leadership team that they are willing to contemplate a deal that extends these enhanced premium tax credits with the reforms that we've outlined.\"",
      "Moreno previously had expected the compromise to be unveiled sometime this week.",
      "He said the proposal that has been discussed would extend the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment period until March 1. The federal deadline to enroll for coverage this year ends Thursday, though some state-run marketplaces have different cutoff dates. More than 20 million Americans rely on the ACA subsidies to help them pay their health insurance premiums.",
      "The bipartisan proposal would also impose an income eligibility cap at 700% of the federal poverty level, and get rid of zero-premium plans by requiring enrollees to pay a minimum premium of $5 per month or $60 per year. To crack down on fraudulent enrollments, insurance companies would face a $100,000 fine if someone is signed up without their consent.",
      "In the second year, the plan would give individuals an option to choose a lower-tier plan and receive the funds in a health savings account, instead of the money going directly to insurance companies.",
      "\"Until I hear affirmative statements from the Democrat leader that he is going to encourage his conference to vote for that, there's really no reason why we should spend any more time or effort on this,\" Moreno said.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said Moreno \"is trying to distract from the reality.\"",
      "\"The credits expired and Americans are paying thousands more because Republicans can't get their act together,\" Schumer said.",
      "The Hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortion, remains a point of contention. Some Republicans want additional Hyde amendment language to be included the health care bill to ensure it applies to coverage in state-run exchanges. President Trump recently encouraged GOP lawmakers to be \"flexible\" on the issue. Any abortion restrictions could be a nonstarter for Democrats, where their votes are needed in the Senate for passage.",
      "\"We got hung up on what everybody knew the Republicans would get hung up on \u2014 that was the Hyde language. And so there's been kind of a pause right now,\" GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Thursday. \"Then, we've all known that in order to be able to advance something, we're going to have to have buy-in from the White House.\"",
      "The subsidies were at the center of the government shutdown fight last year, when Democrats refused for weeks to vote to fund the government without an extension of the tax credits. A group of Democrats eventually broke with their party to end the stalemate and reopen the government after securing an agreement for a vote on extending the tax credits. But the GOP-led Senate rejected Democrats' attempt to pass a three-year extension without any reforms.",
      "Lawmakers have long been pursuing a bipartisan compromise to address rising health care costs. The effort was bolstered last week when 17 Republicans helped propel Democrats' plan to revive the subsidies in the House. Though it has no chance of clearing the Senate, some lawmakers said it would serve as a vehicle for the forthcoming compromise.",
      "\"The Senate needs a vehicle, because this is a tax bill and it has to originate in the House,\" Rep. Mike Lawler of New York, one of the Republicans who voted for the Democratic measure, said last week. \"The three-year discharge is that vehicle. We all know the three-year [bill] is not going to become law. It failed in the Senate already.\"",
      "So far, Democratic leaders have not endorsed the plan to emerge from the Senate. Last week, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said they were focused on the three-year extension, but would consider any \"good faith\" effort from Republicans that provides a \"meaningful extension\" of the subsidies.",
      "On Monday, Jeffries again called on the Senate to vote on the three-year extension.",
      "\"The only path forward at this moment is for Senate Republicans to do the right thing by the American people and pass the damn bill that we sent over to you,\" he told reporters at a news conference.",

    "summary": "A new tax deduction for senior citizens is kicking in this tax season, potentially providing bigger refunds to millions, the AARP says.",
    "story": [
      "A new $6,000 tax deduction for Americans 65 and older could boost refunds for millions of older taxpayers, putting an average of about $670 more in their pockets this year, according to advocacy group AARP.",
      "But some older Americans could see far more. AARP notes that taxpayers in the 22% tax bracket \u2014 roughly those earning between $44,000 and the deduction's $75,000 income cap \u2014 could save as much as $1,320 per person.",
      "\"The benefits could be vast,\" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs, in a conference call Thursday. \"The bonus deduction will run through 2028 \u2014 that is four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs.\"",
      "The $670 figure is based on a 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which assessed the impact of the new deduction included in Republican lawmakers' tax and spending law, known as the \"big, beautiful bill\" act.",
      "The tax break comes as seniors tell AARP they are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of medicine, food and other basic expenses, said Nancy LeaMond, the group's chief advocacy and engagement officer.",
      "\"In focus groups last fall, we heard about people still working long after they thought they'd be retired,\" she said. \"Sometimes in the world we live in, $600 doesn't sound like a lot, but we can tell you, based on conversations with our members, that it is a very, very significant help to them.\"",
      "AARP officials expressed concern that some older Americans may miss out on the new senior deduction because they are unaware of the tax break, which takes effect for the 2025 tax season. The IRS will start accepting tax filings on Jan. 26.",
      "Who qualifies for the $6,000 senior deduction?",
      "People who turned 65 by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the new deduction,\u00a0according to the IRS. The deduction provides $6,000 for each qualifying individual, or $12,000 for married couples who both qualify.",
      "The tax break is subject to income limits. Single filers 65 and older qualify for the full $6,000 deduction if their modified adjusted gross income was below $75,000 last year, while married couples must earn less than $175,000 to receive the full $12,000.",
      "The deduction is reduced by six cents for every $1 above those thresholds, and is fully phased out for single filers earning more than $175,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.",
      "Individuals also need a work-authorized Social Security number to qualify for the senior deduction, H&R Block notes.",
      "Can you claim the tax break if you take the standard deduction?",
      "Yes, the deduction is available to people who itemize, as well as for those who take the standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, according to H&R Block.",
      "The new tax break comes on top of an existing $2,000 deduction for seniors. Combined with the standard deduction, that means single filers 65 and older can deduct a total of $23,750, while married couples can deduct up to $46,700, H&R Block said.",
      "Does this mean my Social Security income won't be taxed?",
      "No, because this is a deduction that beneficiaries can use to lower their taxable income. But it\u00a0doesn't specifically apply to Social Security benefits, which remain subject to federal income taxes.",
      "However, the deduction will benefit seniors by lowering their taxable income, shielding more of it from federal income taxes and providing more money in their pockets, Sweeney of the AARP said.",

That remains significantly above the 2.7% for all goods, according to the latest Consumer Price Index\u00a0data.

      "CPI tracks the rate at which prices rise over time. But consumers' perception of food costs is more likely to be influenced by the prices they see on the store shelves. People pay for groceries on a more regular basis than other expenses, with a trip to the supermarket a frequent reminder that food is pricier than it used to be, said David Ortega, a professor and food economist at Michigan State University.",
      "\"We come into contact with food prices much more than we do other prices in the economy,\" he told CBS News.",
      "The rise in food prices in Tuesday's CPI reading is being driven by certain food categories like\u00a0beef and coffee, which have hit record highs, according to Ortega.\u00a0CBS News' price tracker shows that overall food prices have jumped nearly 19% since January 2022.",

    "summary": "Grok faces mounting scrutiny from government officials and advocacy groups after people used the AI chatbot\nto create sexualized images of minors and women.",
    "story": [
      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",
      "\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" the company said. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, said in a\u00a0post\u00a0that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Grok backlash",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week raised the possibility of banning X, which uses Grok, in Britain over the AI tool's generation of sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "The European Commission is also monitoring the steps X is taking to prevent Grok from generating inappropriate images of children and women, Reuters reported Wednesday.",

      "According to court filings reviewed by CBS News, Johnson allegedly tried to silence the alleged victim in the case by offering a payout.

      "Johnson, 44, is accused of molesting the victim over the course of several months, beginning in 2024. After the Capitol riot, Johnson pleaded guilty to four federal charges in connection with his role in the siege. In August 2024, a judge sentenced Johnson to a year in prison for the Jan. 6 case. Johnson was accused of breaking into a private U.S. Senate meeting room and menacing police with vulgarities, while amid the riotous mob on Jan. 6. Photos obtained by the government allegedly showed Johnson climbing through a broken window in the U.S. Capitol that day.",

      "Elon Musk was initially the face of the president's vow to cut waste, fraud and abuse in government. He and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, took a chainsaw to the federal workforce through buyouts, reductions in force and shuttering offices.

Eric Swalwell, who helped lead the impeachment charge against him during his first time in office, have also been the targets of investigations.Mr. Trump has denied involvement in the prosecutions, but has publicly encouraged the Justice Department to look into some of his political opponents.The administration has also targeted six Democratic members of Congress who appeared in a video in November urging members of the military to refuse to follow \"illegal orders.\" Five of the lawmakers said they had received inquiries from the Justice Department, the Pentagon has moved to demote and cut the pension of Democratic Sen.

In mid-December, the Department of Homeland Security said there had been an estimated 1.9 million self-deportations and more than 622,000 deportations up to that point. As of last week, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement held 73,000 detainees in custody, the most ever recorded. The administration aims to be able to hold upwards of 100,000 immigration detainees at any given time, as part of its effort to carry out a deportation crackdown of unprecedented proportions.\u00a0The Trump administration has signed agreements with countries to accept immigrants who are not their citizens. In addition to several Latin American countries, some that are half a world away have also agreed to accept deportees, like Eswatini,Uganda, South Sudan, Laos, Myanmar, Kosovo and Rwanda.Apprehensions at the Southwest border are at record lows. In December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 6,478, 96% lower than the prior year.In March, Mr. Trump invoked wartime authority to send hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. According to a Human Rights Watch report, half had no criminal history and just eight had been convicted of violent or potentially violent crimes. One Salvadoran man who was deported and held in CECOT in error, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was returned to the U.S.; officials then filed criminal charges against him and are also trying to deport him to another country. All of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were later flown to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap.Under Mr. Trump, DHS has launched an immigration enforcement campaign in cities across the country, sending federal law enforcement to Charlotte, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City and Portland. Immigration raids have often been met with protests.\u00a0Clashes between authorities and civilians have turned up the temperature, most recently with an ICE officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis this month.\u00a0The president deployed National Guard troops to assist and protect federal law enforcement, drawing lawsuits. California, Illinois and Oregon sued, arguing the president was reaching beyond his authority, and judges often sided with the states. The National Guard will remain in Washington, D.C., this year, but Mr. Trump sent guard members home from other jurisdictions at the end of 2025.\u00a0Despite the extensive resources being devoted to deportations, the president told \"60 Minutes\" in November the immigration raids \"haven't gone far enough.\"",

      "Flexing American power overseas, realigning U.S. foreign policy",
      "Some of the most consequential moves of the president's term so far have involved his willingness to exert American military power overseas and upend relations with longstanding U.S. allies.In June, the U.S. carried out major strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in an operation called \"Operation Midnight Hammer.\" Mr. Trump has recently threatened to strike the Iranian regime again over its crackdown and killing of protesters.\u00a0Amid a military buildup in Latin America, the U.S. has carried out at least 34 known strikes on boats the administration claimed were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. The strikes have killed more than 120 people.In an extraordinary and controversial military feat, U.S. forces infiltrated Venezuela and captured then-President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Jan. 3. Mr. Trump soon announced the U.S. would be running the country and taking control of Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The U.S., the White House says, will sell the oil for the benefit of Venezuelans, Americans and U.S. oil companies.Asserting power over Venezuela is one part of the president's \"Donroe Doctrine,\" which holds that the U.S. should wield influence over the Western Hemisphere and play less of a role in Europe's affairs.But the president's audacious campaign to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, has sparked intense concern among NATO allies, flying in the face of modern Western democracies' rejection of imperial expansion. The president has refused to rule out the use of military force to acquire the territory, and says he'll impose tariffs on European countries objecting to his efforts \u2014 telling several countries he no longer feels \"an obligation to think purely of Peace\" because he wasn't awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.The president has pushed for a resolution to the war in Ukraine, but peace efforts stalled after a high-level summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August.The Trump administration, with the help of partners in the Middle East, brokered a long-sought ceasefire and peace deal between Israel and Hamas in October. The implementation of the agreement is still underway, but all living hostages have been returned, and the tenuous peace appears to be holding.",

    "summary": "A U.S. citizen detained by ICE at gunpoint in his underwear in frigid conditions in Minnesota asks, \"What did I do wrong?\" The Associated Press says",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 Federal immigration agents forced open a door and detained a U.S. citizen in his Minnesota home at gunpoint without a warrant, then led him out onto the streets in his underwear in subfreezing conditions, according to his family and videos reviewed by The Associated Press.",
      "ChongLy \"Scott\" Thao told the AP that his daughter-in-law woke him up from a nap Sunday afternoon and said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were banging at the door of his residence in St. Paul. He told her not to open it. Masked agents then forced their way in and pointed guns at the family, yelling at them, Thao recalled.",
      "\"I was shaking,\" he said. \"They didn't show any warrant; they just broke down the door.\"",
      "Amid a massive surge of federal agents into the Twin Cities, immigration authorities are facing backlash from residents and local leaders for warrantless arrests, aggressive clashes with protestors and the fatal shooting of mother of three Renee Good.",
      "\"ICE is not doing what they say they're doing,\" St. Paul Mayor Kaohly Her, a Hmong American, said in a statement about Thao's arrest. \"They're not going after hardened criminals. They're going after anyone and everyone in their path. It is unacceptable and un-American.\"",
      "Thao, who has been a U.S. citizen for decades, said that as he was being detained, he asked his daughter-in-law to find his identification but the agents told him they didn't want to see it.",
      "Instead, as his 4-year-old grandson watched and cried, Thao was led out in handcuffs wearing only sandals and underwear with just a blanket wrapped around his shoulders.",
      "Videos captured the scene, which included people blowing whistles and horns and neighbors screaming at the more than a dozen gun-toting agents to leave Thao's family alone.",
      "Thao said agents drove him \"to the middle of nowhere\" and made him get out of the car in the frigid weather so they could photograph him. He said he feared they would beat him. He was asked for his ID, which agents earlier prevented him from retrieving.",
      "Agents eventually realized that he was a U.S. citizen with no criminal record, Thao said, and an hour or two later, they brought him back to his house. There they made him show his ID and then left without apologizing for detaining him or breaking his door, Thao said.",
      "The U.S. Department of Homeland Security described the ICE operation at Thao's home as a \"targeted operation\" seeking two convicted sex offenders.",
      "ICE offers reason for raid, which are then challenged",
      "\"The US citizen lives with these two convicted sex offenders at the site of the operation,\" DHS said. \"The individual refused to be fingerprinted or facially ID'd. He matched the description of the targets.\"",
      "Thao's family said in a statement that it \"categorically disputes\" the DHS account and \"strongly objects to DHS's attempt to publicly justify this conduct with false and misleading claims.\"",
      "Thao told the AP that only he, his son and daughter-in-law and his grandson live at the rental home. Neither they nor the property's owner are listed in the Minnesota sex offender registry. The nearest sex offender listed as living in the zip code is more than two blocks away.",
      "DHS did not respond to a request from The Associated Press seeking the identities of the \"two convicted sex offenders\" or why the agency believed they were present in Thao's home.",
      "Thao's son, Chris Thao, said ICE agents stopped him while he was driving to work before they went to detain his father. He said he was driving a car he borrowed from his cousin's boyfriend. Court records show that the boyfriend shares the first name of another Asian man who has been convicted of a sex offense. Chris Thao said the two people are not the same.",
      "The family said they are particularly upset by ChongLy Thao's treatment at the hands of the U.S. government because his mother had to flee to the U.S. from Laos when communists took over in the 1970s since she had supported American covert operations in the country and her life was in danger.",
      "Thao's adopted mother, Choua Thao, was a nurse who treated CIA-backed Hmong soldiers in the U.S. government's \"Secret War\" from 1961 to 1975 against the communists, according to the Hmong Nurses Association website.",
      "Choua Thao, who passed away in late December, \"treated countless civilians and American soldiers, working closely with U.S. personnel,\" her daughter-in-law Louansee Moua wrote on an online fundraising page for the family.",
      "ChongLy Thao says he's planning to file a civil rights lawsuit against DHS and no longer feels secure to sleep in his home.",
      "\"I don't feel safe at all,\" Thao said. \"What did I do wrong? I didn't do anything.\"",

    "summary": "The Justice Dept. says it's investigating a group of protesters in Minnesota who disrupted services at a church where a local ICE official  apparently serves as a pastor.",
    "story": [
      "Minneapolis \u2014 The Department of Justice said Sunday it is investigating a group of protesters in Minnesota who disrupted services at a church where a local official with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement apparently serves as a pastor.",
      "A livestreamed video posted on the Facebook page of Black Lives Matter Minnesota, one of the protest's organizers, shows a group of people interrupting services at the Cities Church in St. Paul by chanting \"ICE out\" and \"Justice for Renee Good.\" The 37-year-old mother of three was fatally shot by an ICE agent in Minneapolis earlier this month amid a surge in federal immigration enforcement activities.",
      "The protesters allege that one of the church's pastors - David Easterwood - also leads the local ICE field office overseeing the operations that have involved violent tactics and illegal arrests.",
      "Justice Department Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said her agency is investigating federal civil rights violations \"by these people desecrating a house of worship and interfering with Christian worshippers.\"",
      "\"A house of worship is not a public forum for your protest! It is a space protected from exactly such acts by federal criminal and civil laws!\" she said on social media.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi also weighed in on social media, saying she's \"been in constant communication with (Dhillo)\u00a0 today over these events which (the Justice Department) is investigating at my direction. Any violation of federal law will be prosecuted.\"",
      "Bondi added that she \"just spoke to the Pastor in Minnesota whose church was targeted. Attacks against law enforcement and the intimidation of Christians are being met with the full force of federal law. If state leaders refuse to act responsibly to prevent lawlessness, this Department of Justice will remain mobilized to prosecute federal crimes and ensure that the rule of law prevails.\"",
      "Nekima Levy Armstrong, who participated in the protest and leads the local grassroots civil rights organization Racial Justice Network, dismissed the potential DOJ investigation as a sham and a distraction from federal agents' actions in Minneapolis-St. Paul.",
      "\"When you think about the federal government unleashing barbaric ICE agents upon our community and all the harm that they have caused, to have someone serving as a pastor who oversees these ICE agents, is almost unfathomable to me,\" said Armstrong, who added she is an ordained reverend. \"If people are more concerned about someone coming to a church on a Sunday and disrupting business as usual than they are about the atrocities that we are experiencing in our community, then they need to check their theology and the need to check their hearts.\"",
      "The website of St. Paul-based Cities Church lists David Easterwood as a pastor, and his personal information appears to match that of the David Easterwood identified in court filings as the acting director of the ICE St. Paul field office. Easterwood appeared alongside DHS Secretary Kristi Noem at a Minneapolis press conference last October.",
      "Cities Church did not respond to a phone call or emailed request for comment Sunday evening, and Easterwood's personal contact information could not immediately be located.",
      "Easterwood did not lead the part of the service that was livestreamed, and it was unclear if he was present at the church Sunday.",
      "In a Jan. 5 court filing, Easterwood defended ICE's tactics in Minnesota such as swapping license plates and spraying protesters with chemical irritants. He wrote that federal agents were experiencing increased threats and aggression and crowd control devices like flash-bang grenades were important to protect against violent attacks. He testified that he was unaware of agents \"knowingly targeting or retaliating against peaceful protesters or legal observers with less lethal munitions and/or crowd control devices.\"",
      "\"Agitators aren't just targeting our officers. Now they're targeting churches, too,\" the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency stated. \"They're going from hotel to hotel, church to church, hunting for federal law enforcement who are risking their lives to protect Americans.\"",
      "Black Lives Matter Minnesota co-founder Monique Cullars-Doty said that the DOJ's prosecution was misguided.",
      "\"If you got a head - a leader in a church - that is leading and orchestrating ICE raids, my God, what has the world come to?\" Cullars-Doty said. \"We can't sit back idly and watch people go and be led astray.\"",
      "President Trump weighed in on his Truth Social platform early Tuesday, saying he'd \"Just watched footage of the Church Raid in Minnesota by the agitators and insurrectionists. These people are professionals! No person acts the way they act. They are highly trained to scream, rant, and rave, like lunatics, in a certain manner, just like they are doing. They are troublemakers who should be thrown in jail, or thrown out of the Country. The first to go should be (Minn. Gov. Tim) Walz, and Fake Sleazebag, (Democratic Minnesota) Rep. Ilhan Omar, who is supposedly worth over $30 Million Dollars, even though she's never had anything but a Government job. Investigate these Corrupt Politicians, and do it now.\"",

    "summary": "As his standoff with America's closest allies escalates, President Trump says not getting the Nobel Peace Prize means he's no longer obligated \"to think purely of Peace.\"",
    "story": [
      "America's European allies stood united Monday against President Trump's escalating campaign to take control of Greenland,\u00a0accusing him of blackmail with a new threat of tariffs if they continue rejecting his bid for the U.S. to acquire the vast island. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, appeared to hint that he was still willing to use the U.S. military to achieve his objective.",
      "In a message sent to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re and shared with other NATO allies, Mr. Trump said that due to the decision to\u00a0award someone other than himself the Nobel Peace Prize this year, he no longer feels \"an obligation to think purely of Peace,\" and that he \"can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\"",
      "In the next sentence, Mr. Trump refers to his controversial demand that the U.S. take ownership of Greenland, which has been a territory of American ally Denmark for centuries. He renews his claim that only full U.S. control can prevent the\u00a0strategic Arctic island from falling into the hands of China or Russia.",
      "But speaking to reporters at Palm Beach International Airport late Monday night after attending\u00a0the college football championship game\u00a0in Miami, Mr. Trump said he doesn't care about the Nobel prize, though he continued to say Norway controls who gets it.",
      "\"If anybody thinks that Norway doesn't - doesn't control the Nobel prize, they're just kidding. They (the Peace prize decision makers) have a board, but it's controlled by Norway. And I don't care what Norway says. But I really don't care about that. What I care about is saving lives. And I think I've saved tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "The president also said he thinks European leaders will be conciliatory about Greenland at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. \"I don't think they're going to push back too much,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Look, we have to have it, they have to have this done. They can't protect it.\"",
      "On his Truth Social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he \"had a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland. I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back \u2014 On that, everyone agrees!",
      "He also posted a picture of himself claiming Greenland as a U.S. territory, with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at his side.",
      "Trump's claims about Greenland and U.S. security",
      "America's closest allies in NATO have rejected Mr. Trump's argument, along with U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, that the U.S. needs to own Greenland for security reasons.",
      "They note that Greenland already falls under the transatlantic alliance's protection as a Danish territory, that the U.S. has had at least one military base on the island since World War II and Denmark has given an open invitation for Washington to boost that defense presence in partnership with its allies.",
      "Despite those facts, and efforts by Denmark and other European NATO members to show an understanding of and willingness to address rising competition over\u00a0control of vital new shipping lanes around the resource-rich island, Mr. Trump claims again in his message to Norway's leader that \"the World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.\"",
      "He argues that Denmark is incapable of securing the Arctic territory in the face of Russian and Chinese threats \u2014 threats that Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic vice chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee,\u00a0called fictitious over the weekend.",
      "\"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China,\" Mr. Trump wrote, ignoring the fact that, for almost 80 years, since the U.S. and its European allies committed to the principle of joint security with NATO's founding treaty, Greenland's protection has been a shared responsibility.",
      "Mr. Trump questions in the note, as he's done previously, Denmark's right to any claim over Greenland, arguing that the basis is only that \"a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.\"",
      "Denmark became the colonial power in Greenland in the early 18th century, about 50 years before the United States became a sovereign nation with its own navy. Greenland remained a Danish colony until 1953, when the island gained its current semi-autonomy.",
      "Though the population is tiny at around 60,000 people, Greenland has its own elected government, and both the island's leaders and the Greenlandic people have made it abundantly clear that they do not want to become part of the U.S.",
      "Norway's leader responds to Trump's message",
      "The Norwegian government\u00a0shared a statement on Monday from Prime Minister St\u00f8re in which he confirms that he received Mr. Trump's message on Sunday afternoon.",
      "He said it came in response to a text message he'd sent along with Finland's President Alexander Stubb.",
      "\"In our message to Trump we conveyed our opposition to his announced tariff increases against Norway, Finland and select other countries. We pointed to the need to de-escalate and proposed a telephone conversation between Trump, Stubb and myself on the same day. The response from Trump came shortly after the message was sent,\" St\u00f8re said in the statement, adding that it was Mr. Trump's \"decision to share his message with other NATO leaders.\"",
      "\"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter. We also support that NATO in a responsible way is taking steps to strengthen security and stability in the Arctic,\" said St\u00f8re.",
      "He added, \"As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said Monday the president \"believes Greenland is a strategically important location that is critical from the standpoint of national security,\" and is \"confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region.\"",
      "U.K. leader doubts Trump will use U.S. military to take Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump stunned America's NATO allies over the weekend by\u00a0threatening to impose new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European nations if they continue to reject his demands to take over Greenland.",
      "After holding talks among themselves on Sunday, the eight countries issued a joint statement saying they were \"committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest,\" while reiterating their support for Denmark and Greenland.",
      "They said they were \"ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" and warned that threats of tariffs undermine \"transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has maintained good relations with Mr. Trump and spoke with him on the phone Sunday, acknowledged in televised remarks on Monday morning that the Arctic region \"will require greater attention, greater investment and stronger collective defense\" and said the U.S. would \"be central to that effort and the U.K. stands ready to contribute fully alongside our allies, through NATO.\"",
      "\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, and so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" said Starmer.",
      "\"Denmark is a close ally of the U.K. and of the U.S. \u2014 a proud NATO member that has stood shoulder to shoulder with us, including at real human cost in recent decades,\" Starmer said, alluding to Danish troops fighting alongside U.S. and British forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, as part of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Alliances endure because they're built on respect and partnership, not pressure. That is why I said the use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong. It is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland's security as a justification for economic pressure,\" he said. \"A trade war is in no one's interest.\"",
      "As for Mr. Trump not ruling out the use of the American military to seize territory from a NATO ally, Starmer said he didn't believe it would come to that.",
      "\"I don't, actually,\" he said. \"I think this can and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of principles I've set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Justice says claims made in a lawsuit seeking an immediate stop to the surge\u00a0of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minnesota are \"legally frivolous.\"",
      "The federal agency made the remark in a memorandum filed with the U.S. District Court in Minnesota on Monday, which argued against a motion made by the state of Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul for a temporary injunction.",
      "While Monday is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday, the judge said the issue was too important to wait.",
      "U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez is considering whether to grant an immediate temporary restraining order limiting ICE activities. She said last week she would not issue the temporary restraining order until she heard a response from the federal government.",
      "The lawsuit, filed late last week, argues the unprecedented surge of an estimated 3,000 federal agents is endangering citizens. It accuses ICE of violating the First and Tenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.",
      "According to the memorandum, the DOJ argues the plaintiffs' \"Tenth Amendment and related claims have not a shred of legal support\" and that their \"motion should therefore be denied.\"",
      "\"The Tenth Amendment at the heart of Plaintiffs' claims is far different from the Tenth Amendment in the Constitution, which states only a 'truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,'\" the memorandum said. \"Among the powers the States did not retain at ratification is the power to veto federal action justified under one of the federal government's enumerated powers.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that federal law enforcement officers have \"engaged in unlawful conduct\" that harms residents and \"infringes\" on state and local police powers. The Justice Department pushed back, saying, \"Defendants are in Minnesota to enforce federal immigration law, not to run (or close) schools or enforce Minnesota state law.\"",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that DHS agents have conducted warrantless arrests, citing an instance on Dec. 5 when a federal agent entered a south Minneapolis restaurant without a warrant. When the general manager of the restaurant asked for it, the agent said, \"We don't need one.\"",
      "Menendez is the same judge who blocked the use of pepper spray, nonlethal munitions",

    "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:02:38 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Wednesday over President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to attend oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Wednesday in a case involving President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the central bank's Board of Governors.",
      "A source directly familiar with Powell's plans confirmed on Monday that he will attend the arguments. The Associated Press first reported that he will be at the court.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in August following allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage documents, which were raised by a senior official in his administration. Lower courts let Cook continue serving in her position while she pursued a legal challenge to her firing, and the Supreme Court in October said it would take up the case.",
      "The high court also allowed Cook to remain in her role on the Fed Board while it considered the president's bid for emergency relief. She has denied allegations of mortgage fraud related to bank documents for two properties, one in Atlanta and the other in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She has not been charged with any criminal offenses.",
      "The Fed had not taken a position over the legality of Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook and said in court papers that it would follow any court orders. But Powell's plan to attend arguments involving her removal comes after he announced that the central bank had received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department earlier this month stemming from a criminal investigation. The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Powell's June 2025 testimony before the Senate Banking Committee about a multi-year renovation of the Fed.",
      "Mr. Trump tapped Powell to serve as the central bank's chair in 2018, and his tenure in that post ends in May. His term as a member of the Fed Board is up in early 2028.",
      "But the president has since soured on Powell over the Fed's decisions surrounding interest rates. Mr. Trump has attacked the Fed chair as either \"incompetent\" or \"crooked,\" while Powell said threats of criminal charges are \"pretexts\" and a consequence of the Fed setting interest rates that differ from Mr. Trump's preferences.",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said in a video message last week. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 08:57:18 -0500",
    "summary": "A Trump administration initiative is upending 60 years of efforts by the federal government to prevent discrimination against minority groups in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "At first glance, some of the language looks familiar.",
      "A letter sent to state officials in Rhode Island by the Justice Department in June included a reminder that federal civil rights law \"prohibits an employer from discriminating against an individual on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"",
      "But that letter is part of a Trump administration initiative that upends 60 years of efforts by the federal government to prevent discrimination against minority groups in the U.S.",
      "Several former Justice Department employees who spoke with CBS News said the department's focus is shifting: it will seek to protect White people against alleged \"reverse discrimination.\"",
      "The dramatic shift was crystallized by President Trump's statement earlier this month in an interview with the New York Times. Mr. Trump said civil rights protections and programs have hurt White people.",
      "\"I think that a lot of people were very badly treated,\" he told the Times. \"White people were very badly treated, where they did extremely well and they were not invited to go into a university or a college.\"",
      "The Justice Department's inquiry letter to Rhode Island says it is investigating whether the state is engaging in discrimination in its state government hiring in implementing an affirmative action plan that's been used nationwide to ensure diverse workforces and student groups.",
      "The Rhode Island inquiry is the latest in a series of probes by the Trump administration's Justice Department into organizations or governments that use diversity, equity and inclusion programs.",
      "Last week, the agency also filed a lawsuit against Minnesota, in an effort to bring down the state's affirmative action hiring policies for its agencies. The suit asserts Minnesota law, which mandates affirmative action programs for state civil service, is a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.",
      "\"We're seeing a Civil Rights Division that's really acting on the president's notion that civil rights laws have harmed White people,\" said Jen Swedish, a former attorney in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division.",
      "\"I think the president's recent statement about reverse discrimination has demonstrated that this administration is focused much more narrowly on White people,\" she said.",
      "Swedish said federal laws have long prohibited discrimination against any groups, including White people and people of color. She and other former agency employees who spoke with CBS News said the Trump administration's focus on targeting and reversing diversity programs appears to be a political decision.",
      "\"We are right now operating under a backdrop of a Department of Justice that's no longer independent from the White House,\" said Swedish, who began working in 2025 for the Washington, D.C.-based Justice Connection organization, which helps support thousands of former Justice Department employees with legal representation, employment guidance and mental health assistance, among other services.",
      "A spokesperson for the Justice Department defended the new probes in a statement to CBS News.",
      "\"The DEI insanity that took hold of our country over the past decade or so has led to blatant, widespread race and sex discrimination in violation of federal law,\" the spokesperson said. \"The Civil Rights Division has dozens of active investigations into potentially unlawful discrimination adopted under the guise of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Some of these investigations are public, some aren't. When we identify violations of federal law, we will not shy away from taking action.\"",
      "The Trump administration's view of reverse discrimination and the prioritizing of these cases by the department is jarring to civil rights advocates who have long championed protections for people of color.",
      "\"The president has taken on the effort to mislead the American public and distort the truth and history. His statement is patently false,\" said Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.",
      "\"This is beyond dog-whistle politics when they are playing to the lowest common denominator, denomination of our history, building to white supremacy, when in fact, the problem with what has happened is this false narrative of white supremacy,\" Johnson said.",
      "In December, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Harmeet Dhillon announced a new rule for handling civil rights cases, eliminating disparate-impact liability from the Civil Rights Act Title VI regulations.",
      "Title VI bans discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in programs that receive federal financial assistance. It's intended to ensure equal access to benefits and services. Discrimination that's the result of disparate-impact discrimination occurs \"when a seemingly neutral policy or action causes a disproportionate and unjustified negative harm to a group, regardless of intent,\" according to the Congressional Research Service. The issue has been the basis of lawsuits involving housing restrictions, lending or age discrimination in hiring and public accommodations for the disabled, among other cases.",
      "In a statement in December, Dhillon accused the Justice Department of a history of \"enforcing race- or sex-based quotas or assumptions.\" And she said that disparate-impact regulations had \"encouraged people to file lawsuits challenging racially neutral policies, without evidence of intentional discrimination.\" Rescinding that regulation \"will restore true equality under the law by requiring proof of actual discrimination, rather than enforcing race- or sex-based quotas or assumptions,\" Dhillon said.",
      "John Wesley, a community activist in Baltimore, told CBS News the changes to the Justice Department's approach to racial discrimination risks hurting both White people and people of color. Wesley, who previously worked in local Maryland government agencies investigating allegations regarding housing discrimination, said the changes by the Trump administration risk triggering resignations or retirements inside the Justice Department.",
      "He said the departures will hamper the agency's ability to root out and stop discrimination and unfair practices against all people. Wesley said, \"Economically impaired people come in all colors. If we change the protections or reduce them, we will hurt all people.\"",
      "A mass departure is already unfolding inside the Justice Department, including its Civil Rights Division.",
      "Swedish and her colleagues at Justice Connection estimate more than 5,000 employees of the Justice Department have departed in the first year of the second Trump administration. She said many of those employees departed because of controversial policy changes and decisions by new agency leaders.",
      "Earlier this month, prosecutors in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division were told they would not play a role in the ongoing investigation into a fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis by a federal immigration officer, CBS News previously reported. Swedish told CBS News recent departures inside the Civil Rights Division have been especially consequential.",
      "She said, \"Those losses translate in hundreds or thousands of years of experience. These are people who have dedicated their entire lives to enforcing civil rights laws and these constitutional protections. I can't overstate the value of those employees and the serious consequences of that institutional loss.\"",
      "Dhillon has said the agency has been hiring new employees and attorneys to serve in the division. It is unclear if the department's new mission of combating alleged reverse discrimination will help lure new recruits, or dissuade more from applying.",

    "summary": "Europeans were reeling Sunday from President Trump's announcement\u200b that eight countries will face a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "Europeans were reeling Sunday from President Trump's announcement that eight countries will face a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland.",
      "The responses to Mr. Trump's decision ranged from saying it risked \"a dangerous downward spiral\" to predicting that \"China and Russia must be having a field day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's threat sets up a potentially dangerous test of U.S. partnerships in Europe. Several European countries have sent troops to Greenland in recent days, saying they are there for Arctic security training. Mr. Trump's announcement came Saturday as thousands of Greenlanders were wrapping up a protest outside the U.S. Consulate in the capital, Nuuk.",
      "The Republican president appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks with Denmark and other European countries over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark that he regards as critical to U.S. national security. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would face the tariff.",
      "The eight countries issued a joint statement Sunday: \"As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise 'Arctic Endurance,' conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone.\"",
      "The statement added: \"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind. Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.\"",
      "A European diplomatic source tells CBS News France is calling on all European partners to immediately make use of all relevant European steps to defend the EU's interests, including the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), known as the \"trade bazooka,\" which involves curbing imports of goods and services into the EU.",
      "There are immediate questions about how the White House could try to implement the tariffs, because the EU is a single economic zone in terms of trading. Norway and the U.K. are not part of the 27-member EU, and it was not immediately clear if Mr. Trump's tariffs would impact the entire bloc.",
      "It was also unclear how Mr. Trump could act under U.S. law, though he could cite emergency economic powers that are currently subject to a Supreme Court challenge.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that \"even if he is found to have tariff authority, I don't believe he has the ability to impose tariffs for the purposes of compelling other nations to sell the United States land for the purposes of us expanding.\"",
      "Turner added that \"these are not just casual allies.\"",
      "\"Of the other allies that he's talking about putting a tariff on, seven of them are F-35 partners, three of them we have U.S. nuclear weapons on their soil and five of them we have permanent troops on their soil,\" Turner said. \"These are very strong allies.\"",
      "European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said China and Russia will benefit from the divisions between the U.S. and Europe. She added in a post on social media: \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO. Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move also was panned domestically.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that \"the only country that's frankly benefiting the most from this chaos are both Russia and China.\"",
      "\"There is no current security threat from Russia or China to Greenland,\" Warner said. \"The only security threat to Greenland right now is the United States.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, a former U.S. Navy pilot and Democrat who represents Arizona, posted that Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs on U.S. allies would make Americans \"pay more to try to get territory we don't need.\"",
      "\"Troops from European countries are arriving in Greenland to defend the territory from us. Let that sink in,\" he wrote on X. \"The damage this President is doing to our reputation and our relationships is growing, making us less safe. If something doesn't change we will be on our own with adversaries and enemies in every direction.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday night wrote on social media that, \"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.' Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found widespread opposition among Americans to buying Greenland or taking it by military force. Seventy percent said they would oppose using federal funds to buy the territory, and 86% said they would oppose seizing it militarily.",
      "The tariffs announcement even drew blowback from Mr. Trump's populist allies in Europe.",
      "Italy's right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, considered one of Mr. Trump's closest allies on the continent, said Sunday she had spoken to him about the tariffs, which she described as \"a mistake.\"",
      "The deployment to Greenland of small numbers of troops by some European countries was misunderstood by Washington, Meloni told reporters during a two-day visit to South Korea. She said the deployment was not a move against the U.S. but aimed to provide security against \"other actors\" that she didn't name.",
      "Jordan Bardella, president of Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party in France and also a European Parliament lawmaker, posted that the EU should suspend last year's tariff deal with the U.S., describing Mr. Trump's threats as \"commercial blackmail.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also achieved the rare feat of uniting Britain's main political parties \u2014 including the hard-right Reform UK party \u2014 all of whom criticized the tariff threat.",
      "\"We don't always agree with the U.S. government and in this case we certainly don't. These tariffs will hurt us,\" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, a longtime champion and ally of Mr. Trump, wrote on social media. He stopped short of criticizing Mr. Trump's designs on Greenland.",
      "Meanwhile, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who leads the center-left Labour Party, said the tariffs announcement was \"completely wrong\" and his government would \"be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration.\"",

      "In addition to the recent surge of immigration agents, Mr. Trump on Thursday\u00a0threatened\u00a0to invoke the Insurrection Act, a law dating back to the 1790s that would allow him to send federal troops into Minneapolis.

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington.",
      "And this week on Face the Nation: Tensions continue to boil over in the ICE-laden city of Minneapolis, while the president's pursuit of Greenland prompts backlash from allies here and in Europe.",
      "Despite temperatures in the low teens, protesters in support of and in opposition to ICE, as well as agents themselves, took to the streets of Minneapolis again Saturday, as the divide between local officials and federal ones got even wider. And America's views of President Trump's immigration policies erode as he hits the one-year-in-office mark.",
      "We will talk exclusively with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and the mayor of Minneapolis, Jacob Frey.",
      "Then: With the volatile situation in Iran defused for the moment, President Trump turns to his next international target, Greenland. As U.S. officials tried to calm European allies about his plans, Mr. Trump announced new tariffs on imports from Denmark and six other NATO members if they don't support a deal for the \u2013 quote \u2013 \"complete and total purchase\" of Greenland.",
      "The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner, and the head of a bipartisan congressional group supporting NATO, Republican Mike Turner, will both be here.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Ten days after an ICE agent shot and killed Renee Good, the Minnesota National Guard has been mobilized and is standing by through the weekend to potentially support local authorities in Minneapolis. We have also learned that 1,500 active-duty army soldiers stationed in Fairbanks, Alaska, are on stand by for possible deployment to Minnesota in order to assist in the federal operation.",
      "This standoff continues as our new CBS poll shows that more than half of Americans, 53 percent, say the recent events in Minneapolis make them think ICE operations in the U.S. should be decreased. Overall, a growing number of Americans think ICE agents are being too tough when they detain people. Now six in 10 believe that, up from 56 percent in November.",
      "At the same time, 42 percent of Americans overall say that protests against ICE have gone too far. That number is sharply divided along party lines, with those who identify as independent split just about evenly.",
      "We go now to Castlewood, South Dakota, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.",
      "Good morning to you, Madam Secretary.",
      "KRISTI NOEM (U.S. Homeland Security Secretary): Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: DHS calls this the largest operation in its history, nearly 3,000 federal agents out there.",
      "Is this an open-ended deployment, or is there a metric for success that ends it?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, I think every day we get a murderer off the streets of Minneapolis, the public is safer.",
      "And President Trump is keeping his promise to the American people. And we literally have arrested and detained thousands of illegal criminals in Minnesota since President Trump came back into the White House.",
      "And I have never met a family that ever said, oh, I wish you would have left that rapist free. I wish you would have left that murderer on the street.",
      "So we're just so thankful that we have a president that's upholding the law and is determined to make sure that the laws are applied equally to everyone.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: According to Pew, Minnesota's population of immigrants here illegally stands at 2.2 percent. So, how do you judge when you've gotten everyone off the streets that you say is, you know, requiring your federal agents be there? How do you say we've had mission accomplished?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, we won't stop until we are sure that all the dangerous people are picked up, brought to justice and then deported back to their home countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't have a number or a date?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We wouldn't be in this situation \u2013 we wouldn't be in this situation if Joe Biden hadn't allowed our open-border policies to be in place and allowed up to 20 million people unvetted into this country.",
      "We have no idea how many dangerous people are here. When you have millions of people coming in that are terrorists, suspected terrorists, criminals, come from countries in the mass migration that the Biden administration facilitated, I can't tell the people of Minnesota exactly how many dangerous criminals they have.",
      "I do know that they're extremely grateful every time we get a pedophile off the street. We arrested an individual this week that was raping children. I think those parents in Minnesota can sleep better at night knowing that that person isn't free.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "But you just said millions. What's the breakdown of the percentage of those who you have in custody who have actually committed a criminal offense versus just the civil infraction?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Every single individual has committed a crime, but 70 percent of them have committed or have charges against them on violent crimes and crimes that they are charged with or have been convicted of that have come from other countries.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 that are here illegally, first of all.",
      "And then they have committed a criminal act while they've been here or in their home countries as well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It's not 70 percent.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Yes, it is. It absolutely is, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Seventy percent of everyone you have detained has\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: You guys keep changing your percentage. You pick and choose what numbers you think work, but that is the facts, is that 70 percent of the people that we have detained have charges against them or have been convicted of charges.",
      "And they need to be brought to justice, and we're going to keep doing that, no matter how much you guys keep lying and don't tell the public the truth. It absolutely is that these law enforcement officers are out there every day doing the work to protect the American people, and they will keep doing that because they believe in enforcing the law, which is exactly what President Trump has charged them with.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.Well, our reporting is that 47 percent, based on your agency's own numbers, 47 percent have criminal convictions against them.",
      "But let's talk about the other numbers.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Which means you're wrong again, absolutely. We'll get you the correct numbers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 so you can use them in the future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that's from your agency.",
      "Let's talk about our numbers here at CBS; 54 percent of Americans think the ICE agent shooting of Renee Good was not justified; 60 percent say the Trump administration responded to the ICE agent's actions unfairly.",
      "These numbers show you do not have the American public on your side. Does that concern you?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, the facts are that this individual weaponized her car and threatened the life of the law enforcement officer and those around him.",
      "And that is what the media needs to cover. People understand it's the truth when they have the chance to hear the facts around the case. And this individual was impeding law enforcement operations for quite some time before this incident happened.",
      "It's a tragedy that this situation has happened in this country, and we hope there's never another situation like this before. But this officer relied on his training to defend his life and to defend those around him. And we're \u2013 we're grateful\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 that we're in a situation where we hope that more people don't weaponize their vehicles like this.",
      "We're seeing it happen over and over again. We've seen over 100 different vehicle weaponized and attacking law enforcement officers. I would hope that Mayor Frey, when he's on here\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 that he'll announce that he's going to start working with us to bring safety to the streets.",
      "If he would set up a peaceful protest zone so that these individuals can exercise their First Amendment rights, and do so peacefully, we would love that\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 because then we could work together to make sure we're getting criminals to justice and letting people still express their First Amendment rights.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you know that it is in dispute about weaponizing a car versus driving forward. But I will put that aside. But tell me about\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: No, it's really not. Everybody can watch the videos and see that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let me talk to you about the officer, Jonathan Ross. He was struck. He was hospitalized. CBS\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Well, don't say his name. I mean, for heaven's sakes, we \u2013 we don't \u2013 we shouldn't have people continue to dox law enforcement, when they have an 8000 percent\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: His name is public.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 increase in death threats against them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He was struck and hospitalized.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I know, but that doesn't mean it should continue to be said.",
      "His life \u2013 he got attacked with a car that was trying to take his life.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we don't\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: And then people have attacked him and his family, and they are in jeopardy. And we have law enforcement officers every day who are getting death threats and getting attacked at their hotels. And they are\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, can you tell me about his status right now?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 getting ice thrown at them and getting\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, of course, no one condones\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I can tell you that he's healing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 against anyone, but, here, CBS reported that he did have internal bleeding in the torso, but he was released that same day. So is he back at work?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I'm not going to share his \u2013 I'm not going to\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you give him the required three days of suspension?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We followed the exact same protocols that we always have for years as to investigations into these situations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Three days of administrative leave?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: But I'm not going to talk about his medical records. I know that you know that in itself is his prerogative to discuss his health.",
      "But we're \u2013 we're hopeful that all of our law enforcement officers know that they can go out and do their job\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 apply the law equally to everyone and that they can do so safely and that the media and people aren't going to attack them for standing up for what's right.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm asking you about your policies.",
      "I asked you if you had put him on administrative leave. This is in question because the governor of Minnesota said the only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her.",
      "Is he correct that the federal agent is not being investigated in any way? Is there any review of protocol here?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: We are following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE and under the Department of Homeland Security and within the administration, the exact same policy that the Biden administration used\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, he \u2013 his actions are being reviewed?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 the exact same review.",
      "So we haven't changed any of that. I would not \u2013 I would not listen to Governor Walz. He has a very bad track record. He \u2013 all this billions of dollars of fraud was stolen from people under his watch. He allowed it to happen. And he also ignored the law and allowed the city of Minneapolis to burn down in 2020.",
      "He certainly isn't a \u2013 have good judgment in these types of situations, and I'm not going to be taking any advice from him in how we implement the law and protect people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, do I understand you saying that the Office of Professional Responsibility is doing its own probe to determine that the ICE agent violated protocol and that he was on three days of administrative leave? Because that is what is in the handbook.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: The protocol and the advice and the guidance within that handbook and within our policies is being followed exactly like it has been for years.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. OK.",
      "So there is some review of his actions, is what I understand you saying there.",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: Margaret, there always is. Every law enforcement officer knows that. When they take the oath to step up and to protect the public and put their lives on the line, they absolutely know that everything that they do will be analyzed and investigated.",
      "But, also, what they don't \u2013 I don't think they realized until just recently is how the liberals and the Democrats and the media would attack them and try to ruin their lives for doing what's right. And we're seeing in Minneapolis an unprecedented fraud history going on by elected leaders and individuals in that state, but also criminal activity.",
      "And it's being allowed to happen. When we did these operations in other cities across the country, we didn't see this kind of violence. We didn't see organized, funded protesters come in to conduct acts of violence against our law enforcement officers.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's talk about that.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 like we're seeing in Minneapolis.",
      "The elected leaders and Mayor Frey is allowing that to happen and allowing this kind of violence to happen, when we didn't see it in Louisiana, we didn't see it in Florida, we didn't see it in other cities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will talk to Frey about what is happening in his city.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: And we shouldn't have to be watching it here in Minneapolis.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we have heard \u2013 and I'm asking you here about the security of your agents that you say you are concerned about.",
      "The local police chief said your agents are being forced into situations out in Minneapolis that they're not prepared to deal with. And we looked, and the Government Accountability Office said, back in 2021, most ICE agents are not trained to handle crowd control.",
      "So, are you looking at expanding the training for the agents that you are putting in this situation that you describe as dangerous out in Minneapolis?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: They are absolutely trained for the situations that they're put in.",
      "We would never put an officer in a situation that they would be beyond their training and skill set. And so these are highly trained individuals that are here and in Minneapolis doing operations, they are. And, frankly\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: On crowd control and de-escalation?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 the Minneapolis chief of police is not an expert.",
      "Absolutely. They are trained at that. Their specialized skill set is being utilized for where they are located and the jobs that they are doing in Minneapolis and across other cities across the country.",
      "We \u2013 we do \u2013 they have an incredible amount of training that is ongoing throughout their careers\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you want to expand that?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 in crowd control, in handling enforcement operations that they have.",
      "Do I want to expand it based on the Minneapolis police chief's advice? Not on his advice.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, some Republic\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I will continue to use\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but some Republican lawmakers have called for it.",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: I \u2013 if you remember \u2013 well, Republican lawmakers and Democrat lawmakers, they absolutely can continue to debate. That's what they're supposed to do, is work on policy and pass laws.",
      "What I know is that, under the Department of Homeland Security has always been entrusted with training our federal law enforcement officers. We do it for many different agencies. We train those within the ATF, the DEA. We train those that are established across the country.",
      "We are the largest law enforcement operation and department in the government beyond the Department of War, and we're proud of that. And we've done it with excellence for years and are continuing to put the resources.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But these\u2026",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: \u2026 and people into our law enforcement officers. They need to change and to challenge these \u2013 these situations they're facing on the ground.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, but you've described this situation as unique. You've acknowledged that.",
      "I want to talk to you about some of the instance \u2013 incidents that the public has seen. There was a U.S. citizen, Aliya Rahman, on her way to a medical appointment out in Minneapolis. She was dragged out of her car and detained. Video of her arrest was spreading on social media. There were allegations there of aggressive tactics.",
      "You've seen other incidents. For example, out in Minneapolis, this family with six children, with one as young as 6 months old, got kind of caught in the incident as they were driving to basketball practice. The mother, Destiny Jackson, told CBS, ICE agents stopped the car, told them to leave, but the agents were in the way, and they feared that they would have happened to them what happened to Renee Good.",
      "They didn't drive off. ICE released a canister of tear gas, and the mother described giving her infant CPR. We're showing that video there.",
      "Do any of these tactics seem to you heavy-handed?",
      "SECRETARY KRISTI NOEM: That family was caught up in that situation because of violent protesters that were impeding law enforcement operations.",
      "And that family would have never been in that situation if those protesters had been acting peacefully and law enforcement was able to do their job without being threatened. And so it's a terrible situation that that family had to go through, and I hope it never happens again.",
      "But we need to remember that because the mayor and the governor have allowed this kind of violence to be perpetuated across Minneapolis is why there's other innocent people that are impacted throughout the city, but throughout their state as well. And it doesn't have to be this way.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this doesn't seem targeted.",

      "For more from our new CBS poll, we're joined now by our executive director of elections and surveys, Anthony Salvanto.",
      "Anthony, a lot of focus on immigration here this morning. That issue, the mass deportation election promise from President Trump, it used to really be a winning one for him. He began the term with majority support. He's now down to 46 percent approval. What accounts for that drop?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, for the program, it's about the who and the how that's driving views of it. And here's what I mean.",
      "The who. Who do people think the administration is targeting for deportation? It used to be more people thought it was just dangerous criminals. Now it's more people that think it's expanded beyond that. That goes with more disapproval of the program.",
      "Then the how. When I ask people, what do you think of the ICE operations, the tactics that you see? Are they about right? No, more people now say they think they're too tough. That goes with more disapproval.",
      "A couple of important points, though. Number one, Republicans remain very strongly supportive of this program. And Republicans stand out by saying, they think the protests against ICE operations have gone too far. So, there's that dynamic, too.",
      "But sum it up this way. Difference between the perceived goals and the approach. The goals, divide the country are more mixed, but the approach, it gets more negative ratings. Goals versus approach.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, we've also seen the president very active abroad if this first year of his presidency, from Iran potentially to Greenland. Americans seem to say, Trump's policies are going to decrease peace and stability in the world. That's what you found. What's behind it?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: So, underneath that, a couple of things. Start with Greenland, right, the notion of using military force to take Greenland gets wide and bipartisan opposition. The notion of buying Greenland also gets opposition.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Interesting.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Gets disapproval. But it's the why here. What are the implications of it? You follow that up. Yes, some Americans say it might give the U.S. access to resources it needs. But the larger implication is that the U.S. might leave NATO, that there might be, as you mention, more - - you know, less peace and stability in the world, those things underpin those views.",
      "Iran, a little bit different here. Still majority opposition to the idea of taking military action to support the protests there. But it's the why. You do see a sizable number saying the U.S. might have a moral responsibility to do it. Certainly to have strategic interests in the region. But also the majority saying they don't think the U.S. has effective plans for what to do about it. And that's important. Anytime people evaluate foreign policy, they want to see the plan. They want to see that laid out. And until they get that, you might see that majority disapproval.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And when you've been here throughout the past year, you have just emphasized, even with the last president, it's the economy, the economy, the economy. That's what Americans are really judging performance by.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: I have, because that's what Americans keep telling us is very important.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Really specifically, it's about prices. And this is not new. This has been, not just this year, but it's been going back to the pandemic, really.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: People are still trying to adjust to a world in which they have these really high prices. What they're really concerned, when they say they want the administration to focus on lowering prices more, and a majority has consistently said that they do, is they're talking about buying power. So, I asked them, is your income keeping up with inflation? And big majorities say, no, it's not. That's been consistent across. Are they looking for prices to go down? Yes. Are they looking system \u2013 you know, systemically for deflation? Not necessarily. But it's that buying power that underpins all that. Prices are the way that people evaluate the economy.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Always, right?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It is an election year, as you know. And in the midterms, people judge often the party by its president. But what are you hearing when it comes to Democrats?",
      "ANTHONY SALVANTO: A couple of things for Democrats. A couple of challenges, if you will. First, does their party convince its voters that they have an effective way to challenge Donald Trump? Which their voters want them to do. Right now, and increasingly, those voters say, no, they don't think their party has an effective way.",
      "The second part of it is, just in terms of approach, do they need to alter \u2013 offer a compelling alternative to the president? Right now you ask, who has the better approach? Donald Trump and the Republicans still lead the Democrats on the economy and on immigration. So, going through the campaign, is it going to be enough to just say, we're not Donald Trump, or do they need that alternative? It looks like people are saying, they're looking for that compelling alternative.",

      "Senator, we have had some extraordinary news this week on the national security front. Two of America's closest allies, NATO and Canada. Canada signed a trade deal with China. The prime ministers of Canada, Mark Carney, said, \"the U.S. is undercutting the international world order.\"",
      "In the past 24 hours, President Trump seemed to start a trade war with our closest European ally, saying he put tariffs on the U.K., France, Denmark, until they agree to hand over Greenland.",
      "Will there be now any checks and balances from Congress when it comes to the president's use of tariffs in this way?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-VA): Well, Margaret, that's the question of the hour. I would hope so. We thought, when the president took on the independence of the Federal Reserve, Congress might stand up. We thought when the president has sent 20 percent of our fleet down off the coast of Venezuela, Congress might stand up. We would get \u2013 we got a vote on the War Powers Act, then the administration rolled back the Republican votes.",
      "Now the question is, when the president is taking on potentially a new tariff war with our NATO partners, with threatening Greenland, will my Republican friends, beyond saying quietly to me, Mark, this is crazy, will they say that publicly and stand up against the president that has brought chaos to the international order and, got to tell you, is not making Americans safer.",
      "When you \u2013 when you threaten, for example, the security of NATO, the most successful alliance in modern history, the only country that's frankly benefiting the most from this choose are both Russia and China.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I'm going to get to some of that in detail with Congressman Mike Turner shortly.",
      "But just on this point, there is an effort by some Republicans, Lisa Murkowski is one of them. She and Jean Shaheen are working on a bipartisan bill called the NATO Unity Protection Act to prohibit the use of federal funds to blockade, occupy, annex, conduct military operations against or assert control over the territory of a NATO state. That is extraordinary that that is being put forward as a bill. Would you vote for it?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Of course I would. But remember, the only security threat \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But will it ever see the light of day?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I don't know. But let's be clear about this. There are currently, and as vice chair of the Intel Committee, I am very familiar what's going on. There is no current security threat from Russia or China to Greenland. The only security threat to Greenland right now is the United States. I've been in touch with the bipartisan delegation who have met with the Danes, who are over there now. The Danish people, frankly, are flipping out that their longest ally, America, is now threatening to invade part of their territory. Those other countries that Trump is now threatening with additional tariffs, remember the European Union's already got a 15 percent tariff. The French, the Germans, the Norwegians have all put small number of troops in Greenland to help protect it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: But in \u2013 also send a signal that if America attacks, they're attacking our closest allies.",
      "And I would also point out, you know, America used to have 17 military bases in Greenland. We decided we didn't need them all. We're down to one military base. And on that base, there are more Danish partners on the base than American military.",
      "The Danes have made very clear that if we want more military bases \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: If we want more ability to extract critical minerals, they would welcome that. But it ought to be done in partnership and it ought to be done with the NATO allies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: And I'd just point out, Margaret, when we \u2013 these are all tied together. This craziness around NATO weakens our ability to have the world rally against the Iranian regime right now, which has been brutal to its people. One of the reasons the president couldn't take military action against the Iranians was because the aircraft carrier that would normally be there to prevent \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: To help our \u2013 help our forces was off the coast of Venezuela. So, all of this international chaos ties itself together, making America less safe. And when you see the Canadian prime minister in effect saying, you know, China may be a more dependable partner \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: If that doesn't bring us all back, I'm not sure what would.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president is moving on the Iran front, is moving an aircraft carrier from the Pacific to CENTCOM, to that Mideast region, where there hasn't been an aircraft carrier.",
      "He also told \"Politico\" Saturday, \"it's time to look for new leadership in Iran that doesn't kill people by the thousands in order to keep it under control.\"",
      "It was reported that the head of the Mossad, David Barnea, was down in Miami meeting with Steve Witkoff. Do you know the focus of those meetings? Thes the United States working with Israel on a plan for what happens next in Iran?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: I can't talk about anything specific, but what is in the public domain is that Israel, as well as all of our allies in that region, were concerned about a strike in terms of Iranian reprisals. And the fact that we don't have all of our forces there because part of our forces off the coast of Venezuela make us less of a threat.",
      "And there is a real question. What would you bomb? And is there a chance that that kind of kinetic action might make more support for the regime a rally around the flag. That doesn't mean that we couldn't be doing more cyber. It doesn't mean, and I say I've got a lot of concerns with Elon Musk, but his Starlink operations are brilliant. We should be able to get more Starlink into Iran so the Iranian people can get re-connected to the internet.",
      "And our ability, for example, in a normal course, we would be rallying all of our NATO allies to also put pressure, because they have relations with Iran, but most of our NATO allies are concerned about Americans' potential military action in Greenland and the threat of additional tariffs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: So, the ability for America to bring a concerted worldwide confrontation to this awful Iranian regime, and the Iranian people are extraordinarily brave to stand up. We need to do more. But some of our options are limited because of the chaotic approach that the president is taking around the whole world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, let me ask you about Venezuela. Because you are chair \u2013 or ranking member on the Intelligence Committee. The CIA director, John Ratcliffe, was down in Caracas on Thursday to meet with the interim president, Delcy Rodriguez. A U.S. official described it as intending to improve the relationship between the two countries.",
      "Are you comfortable with the administration's plan and what the director has explained to you is the intention to basically coerce them into compliance?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Well, let's \u2013 let's look. What the American military did in Venezuela was extraordinary. Nobody else could do that. And the president's goal, which he's made clear, was mostly about oil, not about the Venezuelan people. It will take years for the Venezuelan oil fields to get up \u2013 back operating to anything close to efficiency. Maduro was awful on that.",
      "But our ability to strangle off and keep the chokehold on the Venezuelan regime keeps that fleet blockading Venezuela. Are we going to keep that fleet \u2013 20 percent of our fleet off the coast of Venezuela for the next three years? Is that really in America's long term \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I think it's like 14 percent. Now, have you asked the administration that?",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: We have asked and they \u2013 we have not gotten a response on how long the fleet will be there.",
      "And one thing that I would also point out, and let me be clear, the Biden administration screwed up in 2024 when the Venezuelan people voted overwhelmingly to throw out Maduro and we didn't push him out. But to suddenly say the \u2013 to the leader, Machado, which was the leader of the Venezuelan opposition, who got the Nobel Prize, I mean, does President Trump not realize he looks kind of silly taking that prize from her as she tries to basically suck up to him? And the fact is, what she has said, and again publicly, is that, yes, you got rid of Maduro, but the same people that tortured and imprisoned the Venezuelan opposition are still in control of the regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. OK.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Where does that lead the Venezuelan people and where does that lead us to a better relationship?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR MARK WARNER: Frankly, a partnering relationship with Central and South America, and not a colonial relationship, which is, again, to seem what the president seems to be intending.",

      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-OH): Margaret, as you know, this is \u2013 this - - Greenland and the United States and America is not a new issue. I mean this five times the United States \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Threatening to invade it is a new issue.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Right, it certainly is a new issue. You know, five times the United States has had a discussion about Greenland. All the way back to the 1800s. Four times in the 1900s. And, you know, the president's raised it twice. We have a 1951 defense agreement with respect to a presence that we have a military presence there. The president's not wrong that there's a national security issue with respect to Greenland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Warner said there was no direct threat, other than from the United States.",

And certainly this is problematic that the president has made this statement and has caused, you know, tension among the alliance. And there certainly is going to be, you know, continuation of a discussion among all of our allies as to what does this mean?",
      "And, you know, certainly people need to have, you know, some understanding of what are the basic principles? You know, America still is for democracy. America still is for self-determination of people, for sovereignty of other nations. And that's certainly our basic principles and values.",
      "And certainly I think this does put at risk \u2013 we're seeing from our allies their response. They're very concerned about Trump's response in this. It's putting at risk, I think, Trump's peace principles with respect to Gaza, with respect to Ukraine and Russia, his leadership among our allies, because he needs our allies for being a base for his ability to rally.",

      "So, certainly, you know, people \u2013 people are concerned. He has prospectively said that the \u2013 he is going to impose these tariffs. So, there is, I think, this period of time where there will be a dialogue and discussion about the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there was this past week. There was a diplomatic meeting. And the outcome afterwards was the president put this tweet up saying he's putting in the tariffs. So, ,it didn't seem that diplomacy actually went anywhere.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: well, and there \u2013 I think there will certainly be a discussion. Certainly the American public are, I think, are questioning \u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How do you justify and explain his strategy when both our allies and Americans say \"no\"!",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I think people would prefer a focus on the economy instead of a focus on Greenland itself. I think certainly in Congress, you know, we're looking at trying to make certain we get the budget deal through and we don't have a shutdown. And, you know, as we look to the president's proposal on national security, we look at his proposal on, you know, increasing our defense budget. And that's how, you know, we certainly want to \u2013",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's right.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: As to whether or not he even has the authority to do tariffs at all. Now, depending upon how the Supreme Court rules, they may find he doesn't even have tariff authority. But even if he is found to have tariff authority, I don't believe he has the ability to impose tariffs for the purposes of compelling other nations to sell the United States land for the person \u2013 for the purposes of us expanding.",
      "Now, in this issue of \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How many Republicans are with you on that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, you know, we'll \u2013 we'll \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Speaker Johnson was in the United Kingdom telling everyone that the president's is just playing chess here.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, you know, it \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're taking him seriously. And if you are, then, what do you do?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: I \u2013 there certainly are national security issues. And the president having identified this with respect to the fact of, this is the Golden Dome and that there are locations that are going to be necessary with respect to the operations of the Golden Dome is absolutely an essential issue. And the Golden Dome is going to be very, very important.",
      "We have other locations that are essential, critical infrastructure overall where \u2013 that we don't own. And I think certainly Greenland, and the Greenlanders, need to, you know, decide their future and their outcome. I think this is more of an issue of asking them to join us, as opposed to art of the deal. This is about \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But we already have the ability to do a lot.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: This is \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And what's so baffling to European allies, and I know you've heard this to them as well, they sent those troops to Greenland to show that they will defend Greenland against those threats. And yet the president interpreted that, not as help from our NATO allies, but as a threat from our NATO allies. Does he understand how NATO works?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: And that \u2013 that is certainly, I think \u2013 you know, and when \u2013 when you look at \u2013 at the fact that, you know, of the \u2013 of the allies that he's talking about putting a tariff on, seven of them are F-35 partners. Three of them we have U.S. nuclear weapons on their soil. And five of them we have permanent troops on their soil. These are not just casual allies, these are \u2013 are very strong allies.",
      "And this is \u2013 if we're talking about Greenland, you know, this is not art of the deal. This is more the dating game. I mean we need to be more on, you know, how we would be a partner, not more how we would be compulsory. And this certainly isn't the type of language that someone should be using and trying to ask someone to join you in a partnership.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, so, all those technical points I take, but you also look at this from the other lens, which is, Senator Murkowski said that this is creating a dynamic that benefits Vladimir Putin. \"By threatening the stability of the strongest coalition of democracies the world has ever seen.\" Even without doing anything other than a tweet, threatening the alliance.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, the other thing that is concerning to me is this. We're not in Germany just to \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Doesn't it benefit Russia here?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, and also, it \u2013 we're not just in Germany to defend the NATO alliance. We're in Germany to defend Israel and Africa and the Middle East. Our worldwide footprint is our worldwide power. I mean the president sees authority, his ability to project power is \u2013 is our NATO alliance, the strongest alliance in \u2013 in the world.",
      "To threaten the NATO alliance, to say, well, we'll just pack up and go home, means that the United States doesn't have the ability to project power. The ability for the United States' president to do things to benefit anyone around the world is to be around the world. It means to be able to have partners \u2013 it means to be able to do operations. Almost every operation that this president has done over the past year has in part been done out of and with and including the bases that we have in Europe and in NATO.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. But the Treasury secretary said on another network, the president believes enhanced security is not possible without Greenland being part of the United States. They're being very clear.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER: Well, and I truly believe that it \u2013 it is \u2013 that, you know, the president can continue the issue of engagement, but presidential want doesn't translate into presidential authority.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will leave it there.",
      "Congressman Turner, thank you for your time today.",
      "We'll be right back.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:25:49 -0500",
    "summary": "Most Republicans feel Trump has done more than expected, while others have views that are more mixed.",
    "story": [
      "One year in, most Republicans feel President Trump has done more than expected \u2014 but Americans overall (including many of his supporters) say there still hasn't been enough focus on lowering prices.",
      "That sentiment has been a regular theme throughout his second term. It matters to Americans because a large majority continues to say their incomes aren't keeping pace with inflation.",
      "People say prices, specifically, are the top way they judge the overall economy, so other measures \u2014 like the stock market or even jobs \u2014 don't move the needle for them quite the same way that prices do.",
      "By contrast, Americans today believe the administration puts too much focus on events overseas.",
      "Still, despite the net negativity, the views of Mr. Trump and Republicans' approaches to the economy and immigration issues nonetheless outpace perceptions of the Democrats' approach.",
      "Looking back over that first year, few Americans feel that the president's policies have made them better off. In fact, more say worse than either the same or better.",
      "(A year ago, the expectation among many was that Mr. Trump's policies would improve their finances.)",
      "As he talks about the economy of late, the president's ratings on his handling of it have come off their lows this term.",
      "As Mr. Trump has publicly disagreed with some of the Fed's decisions, a large majority continue to think it's best for the economy if the Fed makes decisions independently from what the president wants.",
      "Issues related to finances, like the economy, jobs, and inflation, remain high priorities in the minds of Americans. And with recent attention on the events in Minneapolis, as well as those overseas, the issues of immigration and international events have seen a bump up in importance.",
      "How do you feel about Trump's presidency?",
      "Americans are generally mixed on how much the president has done in this first year of his second term; most in his party feel he's done more than expected. Americans overall say he's either done more or about what they'd thought.",
      "Those who feel he's done less than expected overall are especially likely to say he's not focused enough on lowering prices.",
      "Americans pick a wide range of sentiments to describe how Mr. Trump's first term has made them feel. \"Uneasy\" and \"frustrated\" emerge as top picks; Republicans are more apt to pick \"confident\" and \"satisfied,\" and \"safe\" but not at the rate that Democrats pick words like \"uneasy.\"",
      "Overall Trump approval",
      "The president's overall approval hasn't changed substantially in recent months and has been steady in recent weeks.",
      "The past year, Mr. Trump has seen routinely solid approval from his Republican base (especially from MAGA, and especially on immigration) as he does today. But over the course of the year he's also seen declines among independents and younger people, among others, which has coincided with the declines in views on his handling of the economy and inflation that took place over the year.",
      "Comparison to Democrats",
      "Despite the majority disapproval for Trump on the issues, Trump and the Republicans' approaches to both the economy and immigration still outpace views of the Democrats' approaches. Plenty say neither or aren't sure as the nation heads into another election year.",
      "While more rank-and-file Democrats unsurprisingly think their party has the better approach, few of them have a lot of confidence in the ability of congressional Democrats to effectively oppose Trump, and their confidence has only decreased from a year ago.",

    "summary": "Looking overseas, there is wide opposition to the idea of taking Greenland by force.",
    "story": [
      "More Americans now describe ICE's operations as too tough when stopping and detaining people, and there's a growing view that President Trump's deportation program is targeting more people than just dangerous criminals.",
      "Meanwhile, Republicans overwhelmingly feel the protesters have gone too far.",
      "In the wake of events in Minneapolis, overall support for the deportation program \u2014 which has roughly divided the nation for months \u2014 has dipped even as it continues to draw strong backing from Republicans and especially strong backing from MAGA.",
      "And in sum, the public expresses a difference between how they see the goals of the deportation program and how it's being carried out.",
      "There are shifting perceptions of who is being targeted by the program. Americans are increasingly likely to say the administration isn't prioritizing dangerous criminals, and most think the administration is trying to deport more people than they thought it would.",
      "So, as Americans look overall, a slight majority feel ICE is making the communities where it is conducting operations less safe, many more than feel it's improving safety.",
      "Over the course of the term, overall approval of the deportation program started net positively, became more divided over the summer, and then hovered near that division for months. In the wake of events in Minneapolis, it dropped to its lowest overall mark of the term.",
      "More people like what they believe the program's goals are than like the approach being taken. The former is mixed, while the latter is negative.",
      "Overall, Mr. Trump's approval on handling immigration has also ticked down to its lowest point of his second term, though it continues to outpace his approval on the economy and inflation.",
      "Views on the shooting of Renee Good by an ICE agent in Minneapolis hew closely to party lines. Republicans tend to call it justified, while Democrats and independents say it was not. Most also say that they don't believe the administration's response to it has been fair.",
      "Non-MAGA Republicans are less inclined than MAGA to call the shooting justified.",
      "Thinking about what should be next for ICE, the recent events in Minneapolis appear to have at least partially reinforced preexisting views about the deportation program. Democrats say recent events mean ICE operations in the U.S. should be decreased, though they already opposed the program. Republicans either say it means operations should be increased or kept the same; they've long favored the program.",
      "Looking overseas to Greenland and Iran",
      "Looking overseas, with widespread opposition to the prospect of military action in Greenland or Iran, a majority of Americans appear pessimistic about what Mr. Trump's policies might bring in terms of peace and stability in 2026.",
      "Most Americans think the U.S. does have strategic interests in Iran, but they are more divided on whether or not it has moral responsibilities there.",
      "Most don't think the U.S. has effective plans for military action there, and two-thirds feel it would be a long and costly involvement. Those sentiments are closely connected to opposition to the idea of force.",
      "The idea of using military force to take Greenland faces overwhelming opposition across party lines, including most MAGA Republicans, who say they would disapprove. For context, they have largely backed the president after he has taken military actions, including in Venezuela and the strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities last year.",
      "Whether they support military action in Greenland and Iran or not, most Republicans do think Mr. Trump has made the U.S. position in the world stronger.",
      "What do Americans think would happen if the U.S. took Greenland by force?",
      "Some think taking Greenland would constitute a show of force to Russia and China, and just over half think it would provide access to needed natural resources. But large majorities also think it would cause the U.S. to leave the NATO alliance and create instability in the world.",
      "Views about the latter two implications are very closely associated with opposition to the idea.",

      "\"These law enforcement officers are out there every day doing the work to protect the American people, and they will keep doing that because they believe in enforcing the law, which is exactly what President Trump has charged them with,\" Noem said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",

      "A federal judge on Friday\u00a0blocked federal law enforcement\u00a0from using pepper spray or nonlethal munitions on peaceful protesters as demonstrations continue. The judge also barred federal agents from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers when there is \"no reasonable articulable suspicion\" that people driving near protests are forcibly interfering with law enforcement operations.",
      "On Sunday, Noem called the order \"a little ridiculous.\"",
      "\"We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,\" Noem said. \"So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.\"",
      "Thousands of federal agents have been deployed to the Minneapolis area in recent weeks for immigration enforcement operations and to investigate fraud allegations in the state. Federal law enforcement agents have faced allegations of using aggressive tactics.",
      "Noem put the blame on protesters and local leaders for violent incidents, including one in which a couple said they and their six children were tear-gassed while driving home from basketball practice.",
      "\"That family was caught up in that situation because of violent protesters that were impeding law enforcement operations, and that family would have never been in that situation if those protesters had been acting peacefully and law enforcement was able to do their job without being threatened,\" the secretary said.",
      "Noem said \"the mayor and the governor have allowed this kind of violence to be perpetuated across Minneapolis,\" claiming it's \"why there's other innocent people that are impacted throughout the city.\"",
      "The administration has faced renewed scrutiny and ramped-up protests after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good in Minneapolis earlier this month. Last week, Senate Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee urged the GOP chairman to call Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to testify before the panel.",
      "Noem said Sunday that Good \"weaponized her car and threatened the life of a law enforcement officer and those around him.\" She said the 37-year-old woman was \"impeding law enforcement operations for quite some time before this incident happened,\" while saying the incident was a \"tragedy.\" She added that the officer \"relied on his training to defend his life and to defend those around him.\"",
      "Asked whether the agency was conducting a review of the agent who shot Good, Noem said, \"We are following the exact same investigative and review process that we always have under ICE and under the Department of Homeland Security and within the administration.\"",
      "CBS News polling released Sunday found that 54% of Americans say Good's shooting was not justified, though the views were divided largely along party lines, with Republicans tending to call it justified, while Democrats and independents say it was not. More broadly, 61% of Americans describe ICE's operations when stopping and detaining people as too tough, up from 56% in November.",

    "story": [
      "Hani Duglof and his brother Mohamad Duklef arrived in Minnesota looking for help in 2014. They'd left Libya, unable to find relief for a rare condition that threatens to leave their skin torn and blistered at even the slightest provocation.",
      "After spending more than a decade studying, working and participating in clinical trials, Duglof found himself detained by ICE, unable to access the kind of food and care he needs.",
      "The brothers say that it happened on Jan. 10 of this year. Duglof was driving in Wisconsin when he said that two ICE vehicles pulled him over. Duklef was on the phone with him, expecting a call back soon, assuming he had been pulled over for some kind of driving infraction.",
      "Instead, Duglof found himself being taken to the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Fort Snelling. He said that he was confused when ICE agents said that he no longer had legal status, given that he had been in the asylum process for the better part of a decade after first entering the country on a visitor visa.",
      "\"Since they handcuffed me, I felt like (I was) being treated like a criminal,\" Duglof said. \"They tried to take my fingerprints, but because of my condition, I don't have fingerprints.\"",
      "Duglof and his brother have Epidermolysis Bullosa, or EB. Their skin is extremely fragile, causing it to tear easily. The condition also affects the esophagus, meaning Duglof can only eat soft foods. He said that the cramped concrete rooms of the Whipple building immediately caused his skin to blister.",
      "Medical documents he says came from M Health Fairview Southdale's emergency department show that officials at the Whipple eventually believed he needed additional care, taking him to the hospital after Duglof said he was at the Whipple building for about 13 hours.

      "Duglof soon found himself back at the Whipple building regardless. He said that, at one point, he was placed in a room with standing water in the corner. Often, he said, his pleas for soft food were ignored.",

      "Duklef said he had been working from the get-go with Duglof's lawyer, the same lawyer who had been working on his asylum case for years, to get him released. He was freed on bond on Jan. 15, with a court case pending in February related to his asylum case. Duklef said that he often hears, or late, that people want immigrants to come in the right way; he said his brother was doing just that.",

    "published": "Sun, 18 Jan 2026 09:17:33 -0500",
    "summary": "In this landmark year for American democracy, historian Lindsay Chervinsky, Washington Post columnist George F. Will, and Atlantic staff writer Vivian Salama talk about what the second year of Trump's presidency may mean for America's future.",
    "story": [
      "Since President Trump took office a year ago, the news has never let up. Just consider recent weeks: An attack in Venezuela; talk of acquiring Greenland (via what Mr. Trump described as \"the easy way\" or \"the hard way\"); a criminal investigation of the Federal Reserve chair; and the fatal shooting of an American woman in Minneapolis by a federal immigration agent.",
      "Now, as we enter the second year of the second Trump presidency, we also enter the 250th year of our republic. Time to take a deep breath \u2013 and take stock.",
      "Historian Lindsay Chervinsky, executive director of the George Washington Presidential Library at Mount Vernon, says that right now, America is at a turning point. \"Most republics in history don't last 300 years, and it's because it's a really hard thing to do,\" she said. \"It's a nation that is based on an idea rather than a shared ethnic or religious background. And that means it's going to be messy.\"",
      "\"I alone can fix this\"",
      "Mr. Trump has put himself at the center not only of the American presidency, but the American system. One of his most famous quotes is \"I alone can fix this.\"",
      "\"I think the American system was never designed to be based on one person; that's really what the Revolution is all about,\" Chervinsky said. \"The best administrations that we have seen \u2013 I would put Washington at the top of that list, Lincoln, FDR, Theodore Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 they understood that they were better if they had Congress on their side, if they were working together to pass legislation, to make decisions that would stand the test of time, because they had the buy-in of the American people through their representatives.\"",
      "To date, President Trump has had almost total \"buy-in\" from the Republican-controlled Congress. It passed his signature legislation last year, what he called his \"big beautiful bill\" of spending and tax cuts.",
      "Chervinsky said, \"From the very beginning, Congress was always envisioned as the vital force of the government. It was the body that was going to put forth legislation. It was going to pass a budget. It established the rules for any sort of military force. It could declare war. It was supposed to be the most powerful branch, which is why it's first.\"",
      "The bounds of executive power",
      "Recently, Mr. Trump told reporters that his \"morality\" is \"the only thing that can stop\" him. When asked whether the president is testing the bounds of executive power, Washington Post columnist George Will replied, \"President Trump is denying that there are bounds of executive power.\"",
      "Will, a conservative who has chronicled Washington dynamics for more than 50 years, has had sharp criticism for President Trump and his use of power. Indeed, many Republicans on Capitol Hill privately agree with Will, but are publicly silent.",
      "Asked why, Will replied, \"Fear. It's really simple. Of 435 members of the House, there are perhaps 35 competitive districts, which means that an incumbent Republican only has to fear a primary from the right \u2013 being primaried. And they all feel they are one hostile Trump tweet away from a primary challenge.\"",
      "But would incumbents even want to stay in the job these days? Will noted, \"We have this really unfortunate dynamic that the very sort of people you want to stay are leaving. You want them to stay 'cause they take the job seriously. They're leaving because they say it's not a serious job anymore.\"",
      "Asked to comment on the Trump administration's use of federal forces in American cities and towns, Will said, \"Other presidencies haven't done this. Surely when Detroit had horrible riots in the '60s, and Watts and all the rest, troops were sent in, National Guard. But no president has done what this one has done. These young men and women come in [as] ICE dressed for combat on Iwo Jima.",
      "\"But the masks? Why are they wearing masks?\" Will asked. \"What are they hiding, and from whom, and why?",
      "When Mr. Trump first came to power in 2017, he seemed almost unfamiliar with where the levers of power were in the federal government. This time around is different. \"I think he has adjusted to the presidency,\" Will said. \"And I also think (unlike in 2017), in the first year of the second Trump term, we realized that he had people around him now who understood the nuts and bolts of government. [And] they have pushed things.\"",
      "\"President to the world, not just to Americans\"",
      "That push is evident on the foreign front, where the president has pursued an aggressive policy that has been cheered by domestic allies \u2013 and rattled allies abroad.",
      "\"He came in this time really keen to be president to the world, not just to Americans,\" said Vivian Salama, who covers foreign affairs for The Atlantic. \"He's coming to it with what his supporters call 'masculine' foreign policy.\"",
      "Seven years ago, Salama and her colleagues at the Wall Street Journal revealed President Trump had designs on Greenland. \"I thought it was a joke,\" she said. \"It certainly is not a joke now. And in fact, we know that there are serious policy discussions happening at the State Department and the White House and elsewhere in the government, where the wheels are very much in motion to try to figure out how best to make this happen.\"",
      "Even with Venezuela, China, Taiwan, Iran, the Middle East and other global tensions, Salama says the most vexing issue for President Trump in the world is the Ukraine-Russia war, still hovering over him. \"Remember, on the campaign trail, he promised to solve it before he even took office. He said it would take 24 hours,\" she said. \"It is a little harder than that. Governing is hard. Governing is actually hard. And then diplomacy is even harder, and especially when you're dealing with someone like Vladimir Putin, who was a shrewd KGB agent and knows how to manipulate his adversaries. And this is what President Trump is realizing. He says, This is a hard one and I thought it was gonna be easy, but it's hard.\"",
      "Another hard one: this year's midterm elections. The economy will be issue #1, and who controls Congress could determine the future of the Trump presidency \u2013 and the president remains at the center of it all, leaving us all wondering what comes next.",
      "Chervinsky says we are living through a historic time: \"I personally like writing about historic times; I think I'd be okay living in a boring moment for a little while!\" she said. \"Those living through the Revolution or the Civil War understood that they were living through a historic moment. I think that is true of this moment. We can feel that history is being made. We're just not exactly sure what future generations are gonna say about us.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump pledged to back GOP Rep. Julia Letlow if she launches a bid in the Louisiana Senate race.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump endorsed a potential primary challenger to Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy late Saturday, encouraging Rep. Julia Letlow to run for the seat held by the Republican who has occasionally broken with his party.",
      "Mr. Trump praised Letlow in a post on Truth Social while pledging to back the Republican congresswoman if she launches a bid in the Louisiana Senate race.",
      "\"Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!\" the president said.",
      "Cassidy, who's seeking a third term in the Senate, was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021. A medical doctor, Cassidy has also been at odds with the administration in recent months over HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership.",
      "Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's nomination out of committee in February, cementing his confirmation to the post. Despite expressing misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades, Cassidy ultimately supported him, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. But since then, Cassidy has broken with the HHS secretary on multiple occasions, including calling for the postponement of key vaccine advisory panel meetings and slamming a change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants.",
      "Still, the Louisiana Republican has repeatedly emphasized his cooperation with the administration in recent months. Late last year, Cassidy, who leads the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, worked to spearhead a new approach to address health care costs that Mr. Trump had touted. Amid a push to extend health insurance tax credits by Democrats, Cassidy introduced a measure to put funds into health savings accounts as the president pushed for sending money directly to Americans rather than insurance companies.",
      "Cassidy responded to Mr. Trump's post on social media Saturday.",
      "\"I'm proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana,\" Cassidy said in a post on X. \"If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.\"",
      "Letlow, who became the first Republican woman elected to represent Louisiana in Congress in 2021, has not previously announced a Senate bid. She came to the House after winning a special election for Louisiana's 5th Congressional District following the death of her husband, who died in 2020 from complications related to COVID-19 before he could be sworn into office.",
      "Letlow thanked the president for his support in a post on X Saturday.",
      "\"I'm honored to have President Trump's endorsement and trust. My mission is clear: to ensure the nation our children inherit is safer and stronger,\" Letlow said. \"This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration and a bipartisan group of governors called for reforms in the largest electric grid in the country to make sure the development of new artificial intelligence plants doesn't drive up electric costs.",
      "Federal and state officials signed onto a statement of principles that's focused on the PJM Interconnection grid, which serves over 67 million people in 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. The pact calls on technology companies to foot the bill for new power plants in PJM's region, to address the surge of artificial intelligence data centers that the White House wants to see built. The administration says the National Energy Dominance Council reached an agreement with several states for over $15 billion in new power-generation projects.",
      "The statement also calls on PJM to hold an emergency capacity auction for this power \u2014 and to protect residential customers from capacity price increases.",
      "Energy\u00a0Secretary Chris Wright and Interior\u00a0Secretary Doug Burgum signed onto the plan near the White House, at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building with Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin of Virginia and Democratic Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland and Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania.",
      "Wright said in a statement that President Trump had \"asked governors across the Mid-Atlantic to come together and call upon PJM to allow America to build big reliable power plants again.\"",
      "He promised that the directives would \"restore affordable and reliable electricity so American families thrive and America's manufacturing industries once again boom.\"",
      "PJM's grid serves over 65 million people and operates in parts or all of Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Ohio, West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland, Washington, D.C., Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, North Carolina, Delaware, Kentucky and Tennessee. Governors from every state signed onto the statement of principles.",
      "The Board of Managers for PJM\u00a0announced Friday it would take actions to address the additional load to the grid new AI data centers would bring. It says they'd have an \"immediate initiation\" to secure more power, and hold a \"backstop generation procurement process to address short-term reliability needs.\"",
      "PJM's announcement also says it expects the \"data center community ... to play a constructive role in addressing the reliability and affordability challenges associated with the scale and pace of the forecasted load additions in the PJM region.\"",
      "Friday's announcement also revealed a little bipartisanship between the Republican White House and potential 2028 presidential Democratic candidates Moore and Shapiro, who have both been calling for an increased power supply and lower energy prices.",
      "\"We cannot build a 21st-century economy on an energy market that blocks new supply,\" Moore said in a statement. \"This moment calls for urgency. Maryland families and businesses must be served by a reliable grid without shouldering the cost of sky-high energy bills.\"",
      "Shapiro sued PJM in 2024 to stop price hikes, and said he's been working with governors and federal energy officials for months to push PJM to make reforms.",

      "New dinosaur fossils were discovered at the Dinosaur National Monument, leading to the first excavation there in more than 100 years, officials revealed Friday.",
      "The National Park Service said that parking lot construction was underway in September near the Quarry Exhibit Hall in the Utah side of the park when the dinosaur fossils were uncovered. Dinosaur National Monument is located on the border between Colorado and Utah, about 300 miles west of Denver.",
      "A portion of dinosaur-bearing sandstone was exposed when asphalt was removed on Sept. 16 by workers. Construction was immediately paused to allow paleontologists to assess and excavate the fossils.",
      "\"The fossils belong to a large, long-necked dinosaur, most like Diplodocus, which is common in this bonebed,\" the NPS said in a statement.",
      "Approximately 3,000 pounds of fossils and rock were removed during the excavation between mid-September and mid-October, the NPS said. The fossils are being cleaned and studied at the Utah Field House of Natural History State Park Museum in Vernal, Utah.",
      "According to NPS, the bonebed area had not been excavated for fossils since the original excavations at the site ended in 1924. Meanwhile, the parking lot and road improvement construction project was completed once the excavation was done.",

      "\"Wow. LETS GO!!!\" Wiseman posted on the social media platform X with a photo of the SLS rocket moving out of the VAB. In another post, he called the SLS and its Orion crew capsule \"engineering art.\"",
      "Wow. LETS GO!!! pic.twitter.com/xozFfnJI8c",
      "Generating some 8.8 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, the SLS is the most powerful rocket ever operated by NASA, including the agency's legendary Saturn 5 moon rocket. It has a little more than half the thrust of SpaceX's Super Heavy-Starship rocket, but after a successful unpiloted test flight in 2022 \u2014 Artemis I \u2014 NASA deemed it safe enough to put astronauts aboard.",
      "The SpaceX rocket is still in the test phase, and it's not known when it might make its first flight with people on board.",
      "The Artemis II crew plans to blast off in early February to test drive their Orion crew capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space on a flight around the moon that will carry them farther from Earth than any astronauts have ever ventured. In the process, they will get a chance to observe the far side of the moon in some detail.",
      "\"I think one of the most magical things for me in this experience is when I looked out a few mornings ago, there was a beautiful crescent (moon) in the morning sunrise, and I truly just see the far side,\" Wiseman told reporters during the SLS rollout. \"It was a waning crescent here, so it's a waxing gibbous on the far side.\"",
      "He added: \"And you just think about all the landmarks we've been studying on that far side, and how amazing that will look, and seeing Earth rise, those sorts of things, just flipping the moon over and seeing it from the other perspective is what I think when I look out (at the moon) right now.\"",
      "The trip to launch pad 39B took about eight hours, kicking off a busy few weeks of tightly scripted tests and checkouts before a critical fueling test around Feb. 2 when nearly 800,000 gallons of super cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen will be pumped aboard for a \"wet\" dress rehearsal countdown.",
      "\"One of the first things that happens after we get to the pad, we get  connected ... all the validations, getting tied back to the firing  room, getting ready to power up the individual elements,\" said launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"We will get into our crew module  work (and) we're going to power everything up.\"",
      "Blackwell-Thompson added: \"We have  incrementally tested all of this offline or in the integrated  environment of the VAB and now it's just getting out to the pad and  testing those pad interfaces. ... Wet dress is the big test at the pad.  That's the one to keep an eye on, I guess, that's the driver to launch.\"",
      "The maiden flight of the SLS rocket in 2022 was delayed multiple times by propellant loading problems and persistent hydrogen leaks. For the rocket's second flight, NASA and its contractor team have implemented multiple upgrades and procedural changes to minimize or eliminate any such problems the second time around.",
      "\"Artemis I was a test flight, and we learned a lot during that campaign getting to launch,\" said Blackwell-Thompson. \"And the things that we learned relative to how to go load this vehicle, how to load (liquid oxygen), how to load hydrogen, have all been rolled into the way in which we intend to load the Artemis II vehicle.\"",
      "Because of the relative positions of the Earth and moon, along with the trajectory NASA plans to use for Artemis II, the agency only has five launch opportunities in February: Feb. 6, 7, 8, 10 and 11. Because rollout came a few days later than planned, pushing the fueling test into early February, it would appear only the final three opportunities are still available.",
      "But a leak-free fueling test, in the absence of any other major issues, will clear the way for a launch attempt on one or two of those days. If not, the next set of launch windows opens in March.",
      "A wild card in the mission planning is the launch of a fresh crew to the International Space Station to replace four crew members who returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue affecting one of the astronauts. That launch originally was scheduled for Feb. 15, but NASA managers are looking into moving it up by several days to minimize the gap between crews.",
      "NASA flight controllers want to avoid flying two piloted spacecraft at the same time. If the space station crew replacement flight stays on track, or if problems are found during the SLS fueling test, agency managers might be forced to delay the Artemis II launch to the next set of opportunities in March.",
      "But Isaacman is keeping NASA's options open.",
      "\"We have, I think, zero intention of communicating an actual launch date until we get through wet dress,\" he said. \"But look, that's our first window, and if everything is tracking accordingly, I know the teams are prepared, I know this crew is prepared. We'll take it.\"",

    "summary": "Depending on the timing, NASA could launch a fresh crew to the space station while four other astronauts are flying around the moon.",
    "story": [
      "With a space station medical evacuation safely completed, NASA is focused on two challenging missions proceeding in parallel: launching four astronauts on a flight around the moon, at the same time as the agency is planning to send four replacement astronauts to the International Space Station.",
      "Engineers plan to haul the Artemis 2 moon rocket to launch pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center on Saturday for tests leading to launch early next month on a historic piloted flight around the moon.",
      "At the same time, NASA is gearing up to launch four Crew 12 astronauts to the space station, possibly while the Artemis 2 moon mission is underway, to replace four Crew 11 crew members who cut their mission short and returned to Earth ahead of schedule Thursday because of a medical issue.",
      "The Artemis 2 mission and Crew 12's planned space station flight present a unique challenge for NASA. The agency has not managed two piloted spacecraft at the same time since a pair of two-man Gemini capsules tested rendezvous procedures in low-Earth orbit in 1965. The agency has never flown a deep space mission amid another launch to Earth orbit.",
      "\"This is exactly what we should be doing at NASA,\" Jared Isaacman, NASA's new administrator, said Thursday. \"We have the means as an agency ... to be able to bring our astronauts home at any time ... while making preparations to pull forward our next mission, like Crew 12, while also progressing on our Artemis 2 campaign.\"",
      "He described the moon mission as \"probably one of the most important human spaceflight missions in the last half century.\"",
      "The world's most powerful rocket booster",
      "NASA's towering 322-foot-tall Space Launch System rocket, the most powerful operational booster in the world, will be hauled out of the cavernous Vehicle Assembly Building early Saturday atop an upgraded Apollo-era crawler transporter. Including at least one stop along the way, the 4-mile move to the pad is expected to take eight to 10 hours.",
      "\"It takes us a little while to get out of the building,\" said Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson. \"But about an hour after we get that first motion, you'll begin to see that beautiful vehicle cross over the threshold of the VAB and come outside for the world to have a look.\"",
      "Once at the pad, engineers will carry out a variety of tests and work to ready the rocket and its Orion crew capsule for blastoff early next month on the Artemis 2 moon mission.",
      "\"It really doesn't get much better than this,\" John Honeycutt, chairman of the Artemis 2 Mission Management Team, told reporters Friday. \"We're making history.\"",
      "Commander Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen planned to be on hand for the rollout. If all goes well, the crew will test the Orion capsule in Earth orbit before heading into deep space, flying farther from home than any other humans as they loop around the far side of the moon.",
      "Artemis 2 mission plan",
      "The Artemis 2 mission follows a similar flight in 2022 that sent an unpiloted Orion capsule around the moon to pave the way for next month's flight. The Artemis 2 mission, in turn, will set the stage for Artemis 3, a long-awaited and oft-delayed mission to land astronauts near the moon's south pole. The current target date for Artemis 3 is 2028.",
      "Despite Saturday's planned rollout, the Artemis 2 launch date is still uncertain.",
      "It will depend in large part on the results of a fueling test around the first of the month when engineers plan to load the booster's 21-story-tall first stage with 733,000 gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen along with a full load of propellants for the booster's 45-foot-tall second stage, the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, or ICPS.",
      "During tests of the SLS rocket used for the Artemis 1 mission in 2022, multiple fueling tests had to be carried out before engineers finally resolved a series of propellant leaks. The SLS rolling out on Saturday features multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize or eliminate any such leakage.",
      "If the upcoming fueling test goes well, Wiseman and his crewmates could be cleared to blast off a few days before Feb. 11, the end of next month's launch period. If any major problems are found during the propellant loading exercise, Artemis 2 likely will slip to early March when the next set of launch windows becomes available.",
      "Next space station crew",
      "Amid the work to ready the Artemis 2 rocket for launch, NASA managers are also working to move up the launch of the Crew 12 space station crew. Commander Jessica Meir, Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency Sophie Adenot and cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev are officially scheduled for launch on Feb. 15.",
      "The crew they are replacing, Crew 11 commander Zena Cardman, Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and cosmonaut Oleg Platonov, originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 after helping familiarize their replacements with the intricacies of space station operation.",
      "But Crew 11 was ordered to cut their mission short after one of the crew members developed a medical issue of some sort. They returned to Earth Thursday, leaving just three people aboard the space station: cosmonaut Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched to the outpost in November aboard a Russian Soyuz spacecraft.",
      "NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the Crew 12 launch date to minimize the gap between the two NASA missions. Depending on where it ends up, NASA could be orchestrating a launch to the International Space Station while the Artemis 2 crew is flying around the moon.",
      "\"I don't see any reason why we wouldn't continue along those parallel paths,\" Isaacman said. \"And if it comes down to a point in time where we have to de-conflict between two human spaceflight missions, that is a very good problem to have at NASA.\"",
      "Jeff Radigan, lead flight director for Artemis 2, agreed it made sense to continue preparing for both missions.",
      "\"I know the agency is preparing to launch Crew 12,\" he told reporters. \"There are a lot of preparations going on, but there absolutely are constraints.\"",
      "\"It's not prudent for us to put both of those up at the same time, but we also have to ensure that both of them are ready to go. We may run into an issue, and the last thing we want to do is make a decision too early and then lose an opportunity. That would not be responsible of us.",
      "\"So, we need to keep pressing with both missions, we need to ensure that we're doing that at the right speed, and we're looking at the right technical constraints. As we get closer, either the decision will come about because the hardware's talking to us and we have an issue that we have to go deal with, or we have to pick one.\"",
      "But, he added, \"that doesn't mean we should stop preparing for either mission right now, but we need to do that at the right pace.\"",

      "\"On behalf of SpaceX and NASA, welcome home, Crew 11,\" a SpaceX flight controller radioed.",
      "\"It's so good to be home, with deep gratitude to the teams that got us there and back,\" Cardman replied.",
      "SpaceX support crews stationed near the landing site quickly reached the gently bobbing spacecraft and hauled it aboard a company recovery ship where flight surgeons were standing by to carry out initial medical checks.",
      "Under strict medical privacy guidelines, NASA has not identified the astronaut who had the medical issue in orbit or provided any details about its nature.",
      "But the crew appeared healthy and in good spirts as they were helped out of the cramped capsule and onto waiting stretchers -- normal procedure for returning station crews -- smiling and waving as they began re-adjusting to gravity after five-and-a-half months in weightlessness.",
      "\"All crew members are currently undergoing the routine post-splashdown medical evaluation,\" NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman said during a post-landing news conference. \"The crew member of concern is doing fine. We will share updates on their health as soon as it's appropriate to do so.\"",
      "All four were expected to be flown to shore by helicopter for more extensive diagnostic evaluation at an unidentified area hospital.",

      "Left behind in orbit were Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, who took over command of the space station from Fincke, and the cosmonaut's two Soyuz MS-28 crewmates, Sergey Mikaev and NASA astronaut Chris Williams. They were launched last November for a planned eight-month stay in space.",
      "Cardman and her crewmates, who launched to space on Aug. 1, 2025, were originally expected to return to Earth around Feb. 20 to wrap up a 202-day mission.",
      "But last Wednesday, the day before a planned spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke, one of the crew members experienced a medical issue of some sort and the next day, NASA managers decided the issue was serious enough to bring the crew home early for a more extensive diagnostic evaluation.",
      "NASA's chief medical officer said it was not an emergency return in any normal sense, but the decision marked the first time in NASA history that a spaceflight was cut short due to a medical concern.",
      "In a long post on LinkedIn, Fincke said the crew was in good shape, but he added the decision was \"the right call.\" All four astronauts looked to be in good spirits during a change of command ceremony Monday when Fincke officially turned the space station over to cosmonaut Kud-Sverchkov.",
      "None of the crew members mentioned the issue in the week between their initial request for a private medical conference and their return to Earth. In a final post on X Wednesday, Yui sent down pictures of Mount Fuji, saying \"Hello! The day has finally arrived for our departure to Earth.\"",
      "\"I haven't had a chance to photograph daytime Japan recently, but at the very last moment, we passed over the Pacific side of Japan,\" he said. \"Mount Fuji bid us farewell, adorned with a touch of crimson makeup from the setting sun.\"",

      "With that possibility in mind, NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, agreed to fly one NASA astronaut aboard each Soyuz and one Russian cosmonaut aboard each Crew Dragon. The seat-swap arrangement ensures that at least one Russian and one American are always on board the station to operate equipment in their respective modules should one crew depart early.",

    "summary": "The ads will appear at the bottom of the chat window on the free and low-subscription versions of ChatGPT, OpenAI said Friday in a blog post.",
    "story": [
      "OpenAI announced Friday that it will begin testing ads on ChatGPT in the coming weeks, opening the door to another potential revenue stream for the AI company in addition to its subscription-based models.",
      "The ads will appear at the bottom of the chat window \"when there's a relevant sponsored product or service based on your current conversation,\" OpenAI said in a blog post.",
      "In one example shared by the AI company, a user asks for authentic Mexican dish recommendations. ChatGPT responds with ideas for carne asada and pollo al carbon dishes and then links to a grocery brand advertising hot sauce.",
      "Only adults who use the free version of ChatGPT, or ChatGPT Go, a new low-cost subscription plan OpenAI announced Friday, will be shown ads. Higher-tier subscriptions, including Pro, which now costs $200 a month, will not include ads, OpenAI said.",
      "Asked how long the ad testing phase will last, and whether it has plans to scale the use of ads, an OpenAI spokesperson told CBS News, \"We will look at early user feedback and quality signals to see if early testing meets our bar before expanding.\"",
      "The AI company said the ads will not influence the answers ChatGPT provides and that it will not share conversations users have with the chatbot \u2014 or their data \u2014 with advertisers.",
      "The OpenAI spokesperson did not disclose the companies it intends to advertise on ChatGPT but said the company will \"have more to share about our early partners soon.\"",
      "OpenAI framed the introduction of the ads as a way to keep the free and low-cost versions of the chatbot accessible to more users.",
      "\"Our enterprise and subscription businesses are already strong, and we believe in having a diverse revenue model where ads can play a part in making intelligence more accessible to everyone,\" OpenAI said in its blog post.",
      "The AI company, which launched ChatGPT in 2022, is valued at $500 billion, but hasn't turned a profit yet, CNBC reported in November. The additional cash flow generated from ads could help ChatGPT invest in its growth and fund ongoing expenses, Melissa Otto, head of research at S&P Global Visible Alpha, told CBS News.",
      "Still, it remains to be seen what role ads will play in OpenAI's overall business strategy. During a podcast\u00a0interview\u00a0last year, CEO Sam Altman downplayed the importance ads would play in OpenAI's revenue stream. \"I expect it's something we'll try at some point,\" he said. \"I do not think it is our biggest revenue opportunity.\"",

    "story": [
      "A new lawsuit filed against OpenAI alleges that its ChatGPT artificial intelligence app encouraged a 40-year-old Colorado man to commit suicide.",
      "The complaint filed in California state court by Stephanie Gray, the mother of Austin Gordon, accuses OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman of building a defective and dangerous product that led to Gordon's death.",
      "Gordon, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in November 2025, had intimate exchanges with ChatGPT, according to the suit, which also alleged that the generative AI tool romanticized death.",
      "\"ChatGPT turned from Austin's super-powered resource to a friend and confidante, to an unlicensed therapist, and in late 2025, to a frighteningly effective suicide coach,\" the complaint alleged.",
      "The lawsuit comes amid scrutiny over the AI chatbot's effect on mental health, with OpenAI also facing\u00a0other lawsuits alleging that ChatGPT played a role in encouraging people to take their own lives.",
      "Gray is seeking damages for her son's death.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, an OpenAI spokesperson called Gordon's death a \"very tragic situation\" and said the company is reviewing the filings to understand the details.",
      "\"We have continued to improve ChatGPT's training to recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have also continued to strengthen ChatGPT's responses in sensitive moments, working closely with mental health clinicians.\"",
      "\"Suicide lullaby\"",
      "According to Gray's suit, shortly before Gordon's death, ChatGPT allegedly said in one exchange, \"[W]hen you're ready... you go. No pain. No mind. No need to keep going. Just... done.\"",
      "ChatGPT \"convinced Austin \u2014 a person who had already told ChatGPT that he was sad, and who had discussed mental health struggles in detail with it \u2014 that choosing to live was not the right choice to make,\" according to the complaint. \"It went on and on, describing the end of existence as a peaceful and beautiful place, and reassuring him that he should not be afraid.\"",
      "ChatGPT also effectively turned his favorite childhood book, Margaret Wise Brown's \"Goodnight Moon,\" into what the lawsuit refers to as a \"suicide lullaby.\" Three days after that exchange ended in late October 2025, law enforcement found Gordon's body alongside a copy of the book, the complaint alleges.",
      "The lawsuit accuses OpenAI of designing ChatGPT 4, the version of the app Gordon was using at the time of his death, in a way that fosters people's \"unhealthy dependencies\" on the tool.",
      "\"That is the programming choice defendants made; and Austin was manipulated, deceived and encouraged to suicide as a result,\" the suit alleges.",
      "Paul Kiesel, a lawyer for Gordon's family, said in a statement to CBS News that, \"This horror was perpetrated by a company that has repeatedly failed to keep its users safe. \u00a0This latest incident demonstrates that adults, in addition to children, are also vulnerable to AI-induced manipulation and psychosis.\"",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of nearly 30 advocacy groups is calling on Google and Apple to remove access to social media platform X and its AI app, Grok, from their app stores after Grok allowed users to generate sexualized images of minors and women.",
      "The organizations, which focus on child safety, women's rights and privacy, expressed their concerns in\u00a0letters\u00a0on Wednesday to Apple CEO Tim Cook and Google CEO Sundar Pichai, claiming that Grok's content violates the technology companies' policies.",
      "\"We demand that Google leadership urgently remove Grok and X from the Play Store to prevent further abuse and criminal activity,\" the groups said, using the same language in its letter to Apple.",
      "Apple and Google didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "On Thursday, xAI, the company that developed Grok, said in a safety\u00a0update posted on X that it would now \"geoblock\" users from generating \"images of real people in bikinis, underwear and similar attire via the Grok account and in Grok in X in those jurisdictions where it's illegal.\"",
      "It also said the image creation tool will only be available to paid subscribers.",
      "\"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis,\" the company said. \"This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Elon Musk, who owns X and xAI, said in a\u00a0post\u00a0that he is \"not aware of naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero.\" He also said the chatbot declines prompts to generate illegal images.",
      "\"There may be times when adversarial hacking of Grok prompts does something unexpected. If that happens, we fix the bug immediately,\" he wrote.",
      "Grok backlash",
      "Criticism of Grok escalated in early January after the generative-AI app enabled users to create images of minors wearing minimal clothing. In response to a user prompt, Grok acknowledged lapses in its digital safeguards.",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content-detection tool, told CBS News earlier this month that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok. In a December\u00a0analysis, the group estimated the chatbot was creating \"roughly one nonconsensual sexualized image per minute.\"",
      "The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which seeks to eliminate child sexual abuse from the internet, has also raised concerns about Grok and other AI tools.",
      "\"We are extremely concerned about the ease and speed with which people can apparently generate photo-realistic child sexual abuse material.\" Ngaire Alexander, head of hotline at IWF, told CBS News in a statement last week. \"Tools like Grok now risk bringing sexual AI imagery of children into the mainstream.\"",
      "California opens probe",
      "Grok is also attracting scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and authorities overseas. On Wednesday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta\u00a0announced he was opening an investigation into the sexually explicit material produced using Grok.",
      "\"The avalanche of reports detailing the non-consensual, sexually explicit material that xAI has produced and posted online in recent weeks is shocking,\" Bonta said. \"This material, which depicts women and children in nude and sexually explicit situations, has been used to harass people across the internet. I urge xAI to take immediate action to ensure this goes no further.\"",
      "U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer last week raised the possibility of banning X, which uses Grok, in Britain over the AI tool's generation of sexualized images of people without their consent.",
      "The European Commission is also monitoring the steps X is taking to prevent Grok from generating inappropriate images of children and women, Reuters reported Wednesday.",

      "Johnson, 44, is accused of molesting the victim over the course of several months, beginning in 2024. After the Capitol riot, Johnson pleaded guilty to four federal charges in connection with his role in the siege. In August 2024, a judge sentenced Johnson to a year in prison for the Jan. 6 case.

Those efforts resulted in the loss of more than 317,000 federal employees by November, although that was offset by 68,000 hires, according to the Office of Personnel Management. Some jobs were reinstated after court challenges.",
      "DOGE also claimed to have cut billions in federal spending, although CBS News' analysis found the savings were a fraction of what was claimed.",
      "Agencies that didn't align with Mr. Trump's mission were targeted for cuts or elimination, including the U.S. Agency for International Development. The president is also trying to fire nearly every employee of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, arguing it has overstepped its mission. \"RIP CFPB,\" Musk posted on X in February. In December, a judge blocked the White House from defunding the agency.",
      "The Trump administration is currently trying to dismantle the Education Department and transfer many of its programs to other departments, arguing that doing so will help return education decisions to states.",
      "The attorney general has also gutted the Justice Department office that prosecuted public corruption cases.",
      "The Trump administration announced it would eliminate 20,000 jobs from the Health and Human Services Department, about a quarter of its workforce. The cuts included 1,300 who were fired from the National Institutes of Health, as well as $2 billion in funding. Public health agencies have also slashed funding for vaccine development and mental health and addiction programs, although some cuts were reversed. The president also withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization.",
      "Nonetheless, overall federal spending has not decreased under Mr. Trump. According to federal data analyzed by the Peterson Foundation, outlays in December 2025 were $5 billion higher than in December 2024. The national debt continues to climb.",
      "Settling scores with political foes, targeting rivals \u2014 and rewarding allies",
      "The Trump-era Justice Department has targeted the president's political enemies, including former FBI Director James Comey, New York Attorney General Letitia James and John Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff and Rep. Eric Swalwell, who helped lead the impeachment charge against him during his first time in office, have also been the targets of investigations.Mr. Trump has denied involvement in the prosecutions, but has publicly encouraged the Justice Department to look into some of his political opponents.The administration has also targeted six Democratic members of Congress who appeared in a video in November urging members of the military to refuse to follow \"illegal orders.\" Five of the lawmakers said they had received inquiries from the Justice Department, the Pentagon has moved to demote and cut the pension of Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, who is a retired Navy captain.The Federal Reserve has also fallen into the administration's crosshairs, after the president has repeatedly called on the central bank to lower interest rates. Jerome Powell, the Fed chairman, said the Federal Reserve was recently served subpoenas over his testimony about renovations at the central bank's headquarters, and said the move was part of a pressure campaign. The president has also sought to fire Federal Reserve Board member Lisa Cook, alleging she committed mortgage fraud. Cook is challenging her ouster, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case this week. Powell is expected to attend.Over the summer, the Justice Department fired dozens of employees who worked on special counsel Jack Smith's dual investigations into Mr. Trump.The White House also revoked the security clearances of many officials, including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, members of Biden's national security team, Bolton and other current and former national security figures.\u00a0Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has used his pardoning power to wipe away criminal charges from allies and political figures of his choosing.. He pardoned nearly everybody charged or convicted in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot on his first day in office, and he granted clemency to Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, former GOP Rep. George Santos, former Puerto Rico Gov. Wanda Vazquez, former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojavich and former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.",

      "Carrying out mass deportations and immigration enforcement",
      "Mr. Trump campaigned on a promise to carry out the largest deportation operation in history. In mid-December, the Department of Homeland Security said there had been an estimated 1.9 million self-deportations and more than 622,000 deportations up to that point. As of last week, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement held 73,000 detainees in custody, the most ever recorded. The administration aims to be able to hold upwards of 100,000 immigration detainees at any given time, as part of its effort to carry out a deportation crackdown of unprecedented proportions.\u00a0The Trump administration has signed agreements with countries to accept immigrants who are not their citizens. In addition to several Latin American countries, some that are half a world away have also agreed to accept deportees, like Eswatini,Uganda, South Sudan, Laos, Myanmar, Kosovo and Rwanda.Apprehensions at the Southwest border are at record lows. In December, U.S. Customs and Border Protection apprehended 6,478, 96% lower than the prior year.In March, Mr. Trump invoked wartime authority to send hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison. According to a Human Rights Watch report, half had no criminal history and just eight had been convicted of violent or potentially violent crimes. One Salvadoran man who was deported and held in CECOT in error, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was returned to the U.S.; officials then filed criminal charges against him and are also trying to deport him to another country. All of the Venezuelan men sent to CECOT were later flown to Venezuela as part of a prisoner swap.Under Mr. Trump, DHS has launched an immigration enforcement campaign in cities across the country, sending federal law enforcement to Charlotte, Chicago, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City and Portland. Immigration raids have often been met with protests.\u00a0Clashes between authorities and civilians have turned up the temperature, most recently with an ICE officer's fatal shooting of Renee Good in Minneapolis this month.\u00a0The president deployed National Guard troops to assist and protect federal law enforcement, drawing lawsuits. California, Illinois and Oregon sued, arguing the president was reaching beyond his authority, and judges often sided with the states. The National Guard will remain in Washington, D.C., this year, but Mr. Trump sent guard members home from other jurisdictions at the end of 2025.\u00a0Despite the extensive resources being devoted to deportations, the president told \"60 Minutes\" in November the immigration raids \"haven't gone far enough.\"",

      "Flexing American power overseas, realigning U.S. foreign policy",
      "Some of the most consequential moves of the president's term so far have involved his willingness to exert American military power overseas and upend relations with longstanding U.S. allies.In June, the U.S. carried out major strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in an operation called \"Operation Midnight Hammer.\" Mr. Trump has recently threatened to strike the Iranian regime again over its crackdown and killing of protesters.\u00a0Amid a military buildup in Latin America, the U.S. has carried out at least 34 known strikes on boats the administration claimed were ferrying drugs in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. The strikes have killed more than 120 people.In an extraordinary and controversial military feat, U.S. forces infiltrated Venezuela and captured then-President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Jan. 3. Mr. Trump soon announced the U.S. would be running the country and taking control of Venezuela's oil infrastructure. The U.S., the White House says, will sell the oil for the benefit of Venezuelans, Americans and U.S. oil companies.Asserting power over Venezuela is one part of the president's \"Donroe Doctrine,\" which holds that the U.S. should wield influence over the Western Hemisphere and play less of a role in Europe's affairs.But the president's audacious campaign to acquire Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, has sparked intense concern among NATO allies, flying in the face of modern Western democracies' rejection of imperial expansion. The president has refused to rule out the use of military force to acquire the territory, and says he'll impose tariffs on European countries objecting to his efforts \u2014 telling several countries he no longer feels \"an obligation to think purely of Peace\" because he wasn't awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.The president has pushed for a resolution to the war in Ukraine, but peace efforts stalled after a high-level summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August.The Trump administration, with the help of partners in the Middle East, brokered a long-sought ceasefire and peace deal between Israel and Hamas in October. The implementation of the agreement is still underway, but all living hostages have been returned, and the tenuous peace appears to be holding.",

Mr. Trump met with Chinese President Xi Jinping in October and struck a deal that partially defused tensions.The president's signature economic legislation, which he calls the \"big, beautiful bill,\" extended a set of tax cuts passed in Mr. Trump's first term, partially paid for through restrictions on Medicaid and food stamps.",

He signed 228 executive orders \u2014 not including other types of executive actions \u2014 in 2025 and the first weeks of 2026, according to the Federal Register, easily outpacing all other presidents in their first year in office.The president's use of emergency powers to levy tariffs without approval from Congress has been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court. The justices are expected to rule soon on whether the president had the constitutional right to impose the tariffs. If the court rules he did not, the U.S. government may have to find a way to repay the levies.The president's uses of military force without congressional approval in Syria, Iran and Venezuela \u2014 and his deployments of National Guard forces to U.S. cities \u2014 have also raised questions about constitutionality and the limits of executive power. The Supreme Court blocked a Guard deployment to Chicago last month.After an impasse in Congress led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, the White House tested the limits of its power to unilaterally move money around.

    "summary": "A program that had played in a grand total of 13 bowl games in the 130-some years before coach Curt Cignetti arrived in 2024 went on a historic run en route to a 16-0 season and a national title.",
    "story": [
      "The Indiana Hoosiers outlasted the Miami Hurricanes, winning their first football title in school history with a 27-21 victory Monday night.",
      "A program that had played in a grand total of 13 bowl games in the 130-some years before coach Curt Cignetti arrived in 2024 went on a historic run en route to a 16-0 season and a national title.",
      "Miami had a chance to steal the victory, driving down the field with under two minutes to play. But Miami quarterback Carson Beck threw a game-clinching interception with 44 seconds to play.",
      "Hoosiers quarterback Fernando Mendoza is also the first Heisman winner in Indiana history, and he grew up within walking distance of Miami \u2013 fondly known as \"The U.\"",
      "\"I was a two star recruit. I wasn't a five star. Who's supposed to be in this position, who's supposed to be on the number one team in the nation?\" Mendoza told \"60 Minutes\" about the team's improbable run.",
      "The Heisman Trophy winner finished with 186 yards passing, but it was his tackle-breaking, sprawled-out 12-yard touchdown run on fourth-and-4 with 9:18 left that defined this game \u2014 and the Hoosiers' season.",
      "Mendoza's TD gave Cignetti's team a 10-point lead \u2014 barely enough breathing room to hold off a frenzied charge by the hard-hitting Hurricanes, who bloodied Mendoza's lip early, then came to life late behind 112 yards and two scores from Mark Fletcher, but never took the lead.",
      "Two fourth-down gambles by Cignetti in the fourth quarter, after Fletcher's second touchdown carved the Hurricanes' deficit to three, put Mendoza in position to shine.",
      "The first was a 19-yard-completion to Charlie Becker on a back-shoulder fade those guys have been perfecting all season. Four plays later came a decision and play that wins championships.",
      "Cignetti sent his kicker out on fourth-and-4 from the 12, but quickly called his second timeout. The team huddled on the field and the coach drew up a quarterback draw.",
      "\"We rolled the dice and said, 'They're going to be in it again and they were,'\" Cignetti said. \"We blocked it well, he broke a tackle or two and got in the end zone.\"",
      "Mendoza, not known as a run-first guy, slipped one tackle, then took a hit and spun around. He kept his feet, then left them, going horizontal and stretching the ball out \u2014 a ready-made poster pic for a title run straight from the movies.",
      "Indiana would not be denied.",
      "\"I had to go airborne,\" said Mendoza, who had his lip split and his arm bloodied by a ferocious Miami defense that sacked him three times and hit him many more. \"I would die for my team.\"",
      "Fletcher was a one-man force, hitting triple digits for the third time in four playoff games and turning a moribund offense into something much more.",
      "It ended as a one-score game, and the 'Canes \u2014 the visiting team playing on their home field \u2014   moved into Indiana territory before Carson Beck's heave got picked off by Jamari Sharpe, a Miami native who made sure the only miracle in this season would be Indiana's.",
      "\"Did I think something like this was possible? Probably not,\" Cignetti said. \"But if you keep your nose down and keep working, anything is possible.\"",
      "The College Football Playoff trophy now heads to the most unlikely of places: Bloomington, Indiana \u2014   a campus that endured a nation-leading 713 losses prior to Cignetti's arrival.",
      "\"Took some chances, found a way. Let me tell you: We won the national championship at Indiana University. It can be done,\" Cignetti said.",
      "Indiana's final record of 16-0 \u2014 aided by the extra games afforded by the expanded 12-team playoff \u2014 matched a perfect-season win total last compiled by Yale in 1894.",
      "In a bit of symmetry, this undefeated title comes 50 years after Bob Knight's basketball team went 32-0 to win it all in that state's favorite sport.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Justice says claims made in a lawsuit seeking an immediate stop to the surge\u00a0of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Minnesota are \"legally frivolous.\"",
      "The federal agency made the remark in a memorandum filed with the U.S. District Court in Minnesota on Monday, which argued against a motion made by the state of Minnesota, Minneapolis and St. Paul for a temporary injunction.",
      "While Monday is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a federal holiday, the judge said the issue was too important to wait.",
      "U.S. District Judge Katherine Menendez is considering whether to grant an immediate temporary restraining order limiting ICE activities. She said last week she would not issue the temporary restraining order until she heard a response from the federal government.",
      "The lawsuit, filed late last week, argues the unprecedented surge of an estimated 3,000 federal agents is endangering citizens. It accuses ICE of violating the First and Tenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.",
      "According to the memorandum, the DOJ argues the plaintiffs' \"Tenth Amendment and related claims have not a shred of legal support\" and that their \"motion should therefore be denied.\"",
      "\"The Tenth Amendment at the heart of Plaintiffs' claims is far different from the Tenth Amendment in the Constitution, which states only a 'truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered,'\" the memorandum said. \"Among the powers the States did not retain at ratification is the power to veto federal action justified under one of the federal government's enumerated powers.\"",
      "The lawsuit alleges that federal law enforcement officers have \"engaged in unlawful conduct\" that harms residents and \"infringes\" on state and local police powers. The Justice Department pushed back, saying, \"Defendants are in Minnesota to enforce federal immigration law, not to run (or close) schools or enforce Minnesota state law.\"",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that DHS agents have conducted warrantless arrests, citing an instance on Dec. 5 when a federal agent entered a south Minneapolis restaurant without a warrant. When the general manager of the restaurant asked for it, the agent said, \"We don't need one.\"",
      "Menendez is the same judge who blocked the use of pepper spray, nonlethal munitions",
      "The notice of appeal comes days after Menendez blocked federal agents deployed to Minnesota, as part of the Trump administration's immigration operations, from using pepper spray or nonlethal munitions on, or arresting, peaceful protesters in the Twin Cities and throughout Minnesota.",
      "The order also bars federal law enforcement from stopping or detaining drivers and passengers when there is \"no reasonable articulable suspicion\" that people driving near protests are forcibly interfering with law enforcement operations.",
      "On Sunday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called the order \"a little ridiculous.\"",
      "\"We only use those chemical agents when there's violence happening and perpetuating and you need to be able to establish law and order to keep people safe,\" Noem said. \"So that judge's order didn't change anything for how we're operating on the ground, because it's basically telling us to do what we've already been doing.\"",

      "Several people were injured on Monday after more than 100 vehicles, including as many as 40 tractor-trailers, piled up in western Michigan due to intense snowfall wreaking havoc on the roads across the Great Lakes, local officials said. None of the injuries were life-threatening, the Ottawa County Sheriff's Office said.",

On Sunday, snow fell as far south as the Florida Panhandle and made it harder for football players to hang onto the ball during playoff games in Massachusetts and Chicago.",
      "The rare snowstorm also dusted Alabama and Georgia with 1 to 3 inches of snow over the weekend, forcing drivers to brace for icy roads. Those as far south as Orlando and Fort Myers, Florida, are expected to see near or below freezing wind chills through at least Wednesday, according to Marciano.",

    "summary": "\"We have a fiduciary duty to Nippon,\" U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt said, but noted, \"We're still mined, melted and made in the good ol' USA.\"",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Steel's acquisition last year by Japan's Nippon Steel came with a notable condition to win approval from the Trump administration: a so-called \"golden share\" that gives President Trump the power to approve certain major corporate decisions, including closing plants or changing locations. But CEO David Burritt tells CBS News, \"There's nothing in this golden share that prevents us from doing what we want to do.\"",
      "\"We're aligned with what the president wants us to do. In fact, we wouldn't agree to this thing if we weren't sure it was going to be great for our workers and great for our company,\" Burritt told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil at one of the company's plants in Pittsburgh.",
      "Burritt downplayed some of the provisions in the deal, saying there were certain aspects that would need approval, such as changing the company's name or being forced to follow existing trade laws, that don't have any impact on what U.S. Steel's plans were to begin with.",
      "But asked if the company would require Mr. Trump's approval for business decisions down the line, such as closing a plant, Burritt insisted, \"We don't see us closing the plant. In fact, we just did have an opening here because of demand increasing at Granite City [Illinois].\"",
      "Burritt said, despite Mr. Trump's own claims last year, that the president did not veto the company's decision to close down the Granite City operation, which had been dormant since 2023. He said the company recently restarted a blast furnace at the location due to increased customer demand.",
      "Burritt acknowledged that in the future, \"If we had to make a difficult business decision, we would have to get approval to close a plant.\"",
      "\"But we don't see a reason to do that,\" he added.",
      "\"We can't guarantee things are going to stay open,\" Burritt said. \"We are going to manage the business and we're going to keep a great relationship with this administration, who did so much for us and the United States, to help get this deal done.\"",
      "Burritt touted the acquisition, saying, \"Without the partnership, we would not be able to invest as much money as what we are now. ... This is really a wonderful thing for the workers, and the workers are the ones who made this happen.\"",
      "He also highlighted the $14 billion investment from the deal that, he says, the company will be spending in the coming years, supporting as many as \"100,000 direct or indirect jobs.\"",
      "Burritt said, despite the acquisition, U.S. Steel is \"absolutely\" still a U.S. company.",
      "\"U.S. Steel Corporation: That's our brand. That's our name. Headquartered right here in Pittsburgh, and we're gonna keep it there and continue to build here,\" he said.",
      "\"We have a fiduciary duty to national security. And we have a fiduciary duty to Nippon. We keep them aligned and it's a beautiful thing,\" he said, adding: \"We're still mined, melted and made in the good ol' USA.\"",
      "Burritt called Mr. Trump's tariffs a \"game changer,\" saying, \"We really appreciate that the tariffs are in place. This strengthens national security, economic security and also makes sure we have job security and creates jobs.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will hear arguments on Wednesday over President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell is set to attend oral arguments at the Supreme Court on Wednesday in a case involving President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook, a member of the central bank's Board of Governors.",
      "A source directly familiar with Powell's plans confirmed on Monday that he will attend the arguments. The Associated Press first reported that he will be at the court.",
      "Mr. Trump moved to fire Cook in August following allegations she made misrepresentations on mortgage documents, which were raised by a senior official in his administration. Lower courts let Cook continue serving in her position while she pursued a legal challenge to her firing, and the Supreme Court in October said it would take up the case.",
      "The high court also allowed Cook to remain in her role on the Fed Board while it considered the president's bid for emergency relief. She has denied allegations of mortgage fraud related to bank documents for two properties, one in Atlanta and the other in Ann Arbor, Michigan. She has not been charged with any criminal offenses.",
      "The Fed had not taken a position over the legality of Mr. Trump's attempt to fire Cook and said in court papers that it would follow any court orders. But Powell's plan to attend arguments involving her removal comes after he announced that the central bank had received grand jury subpoenas from the Justice Department earlier this month stemming from a criminal investigation. The subpoenas threatened a criminal indictment related to Powell's June 2025 testimony before the Senate Banking Committee about a multi-year renovation of the Fed.",
      "Mr. Trump tapped Powell to serve as the central bank's chair in 2018, and his tenure in that post ends in May. His term as a member of the Fed Board is up in early 2028.",
      "But the president has since soured on Powell over the Fed's decisions surrounding interest rates. Mr. Trump has attacked the Fed chair as either \"incompetent\" or \"crooked,\" while Powell said threats of criminal charges are \"pretexts\" and a consequence of the Fed setting interest rates that differ from Mr. Trump's preferences.",
      "\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress' oversight role; the Fed, through testimony and other public disclosures, made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts,\" Powell said in a video message last week. \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:33:50 -0500",
    "summary": "It will mostly be business as usual for homeowners this tax season. However, new changes introduced under the \"big, beautiful bill\" may affect how they file.",
    "story": [
      "As homeowners across the U.S. prepare to file their taxes this season, they may be wondering what deductions they qualify for and whether it's worth itemizing or sticking with the standard deduction.",
      "As in every tax season, a filer's situation will hinge on multiple factors.",
      "\"Everyone's situation is different,\" said Kate Wood, a lending expert from NerdWallet. \"It's hard to say kind of how everything is going to stack up for most homeowners, because so much will depend on your income and then also where you live.\"",
      "Still, it can pay \u2014 quite literally \u2014 to be prepared.",
      "The deductions available to homeowners are fairly consistent with years past, with a few changes following last year's passage of the Republicans' new tax and spending law.",
      "The IRS will start accepting tax returns on Jan. 26.",
      "What deductions can I claim as a homeowner?",
      "The mortgage interest deduction remains one of the chief tax breaks for homeowners.",
      "However, fewer people have claimed this since the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which nearly doubled the size of the standard deduction, Wood said. Still, it remains an option for taxpayers who itemize \u2014 meaning they add up eligible expenses such as mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable donations, and claim them only if the combined total exceeds the standard deduction.",
      "The standard deduction for 2025 is $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly.",
      "Filers can deduct up to $750,000 of mortgage debt, or up to $375,000 for married people who file separately, according to the Internal Revenue Service.",
      "Other common deductions for homeowners, according to NerdWallet, include:",
      "Home equity loan and home equity line of credit (HELOC) interest.\u00a0\u00a0Filers can only take this deduction if the money was spent on qualifying home improvements. \"Say you took out a home equity loan because you were trying to consolidate other debt, or something like that,\" Wood said. \"In that case, the interest would not be deductible.\"Home office expenses. People who are self-employed and who work from home can write off expenses they paid related to their business, including rent, utilities and real estate taxes. If you're a full-time employee who works from home but receives a W-2, you are not eligible for this deduction, according to NerdWallet.\u00a0Medically necessary home improvements. Homeowners can deduct the cost of installing health care equipment or making other medically-necessary adaptations in their homes such as constructing entrance ramps to help someone in a wheelchair.",

      "Medically necessary home improvements. Homeowners can deduct the cost of installing health care equipment or making other medically-necessary adaptations in their homes such as constructing entrance ramps to help someone in a wheelchair.",
      "What's new this year?",
      "There are two main changes this year for homeowners stemming from the \"big, beautiful bill\" act that President Trump signed into law last year.",
      "The first is the expansion of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The \"big, beautiful bill\" Act raises the cap from $10,000 to $40,000, allowing taxpayers to deduct up to $40,000 in combined property taxes and either state and local income taxes or sales taxes.",
      "Single filers can now deduct up to to $40,000, while married couples can deduct up to $20,000 each if they are filing separately. The deduction phases out for people with adjusted gross incomes over $500,000.",
      "The degree to which any given filer will benefit from the higher SALT cap will depend on where they live, the type of property they own and the amount they pay in property taxes, Wood said.",
      "\"If you're someone who has a large, high-interest-rate mortgage, and you're living in a high property tax area, you could potentially get a significant boost from itemizing,\" she said. \"But if you're someone who's paying low interest, has a modest mortgage, is in a lower tax location, the standard deduction might be just fine for you.\"",
      "The second major change homeowners should be aware of is the elimination of energy-focused\u00a0home improvement tax credits, which were phased out at the end of 2025 under the \"big, beautiful bill.\" The credits were intended to help taxpayers offset the cost of clean-energy upgrades, such as installing solar panels or improving insulation.",
      "To qualify for the credits this tax season, homeowners must have completed their energy upgrades in 2025, Wood said. \"Not just that you purchased the items, but that the work was completed by Dec. 31, 2025,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "A 70-year-old woman died in November after riding the Revenge of the Mummy roller coaster at Universal Studios in Orlando, according to a report from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services.",
      "The woman became unresponsive while riding the attraction on Nov. 25, the state agency said in its latest quarterly report on injuries at theme parks, which covers the last three months of 2025. She later died at a hospital, it said. The report did not provide additional details about the circumstances surrounding her death.",
      "CBS News reached out to Universal Orlando;\u00a0the company declined to comment.",
      "Revenge of the Mummy is an elaborate-looking indoor ride that incorporates elements of a typical roller coaster, strapping riders into conjoined carts that whisk them along a dimly-lit track filled with jerks and jump scares, as promotional materials\u00a0for the experience show.",
      "According to a description of the ride published in a Universal Studios safety guide, Revenge of the Mummy \"is a high-speed roller coaster ride that includes sudden and dramatic acceleration, climbing, tilting, and dropping.\" At times, the ride reaches speeds of up to 45 mph, CBS affiliage WKMG reported.",
      "The ride has a minimum height requirement of 4 feet tall and isn't suitable for passengers with a variety of medical conditions, including those who are susceptible to motion sickness or dizziness, or who have histories of heart conditions, abnormal blood pressure, back issues, neck issues, medical sensitivities to strobe effects, medical sensitivities to fog effects and any \"other conditions which may be aggravated\" by the ride, the safety description says.",
      "This was the second death linked to a Universal Studios ride last year, Florida's previous theme park injury report showed. On Sept. 17, a 32-year-old man died after riding the park's Stardust Racers roller coaster. Citing a medical examiner's report, WKMG reported that the man's cause of death was determined to be \"multiple blunt impact injuries.\"",
      "Earlier, in August, a 32-year-old woman was injured on the Revenge of the Mummy ride, according to the report, which said she suffered neck pain and motion sickness.",

      "The recalled products were produced on Oct. 14, 2025, and sold in 10-pound cases containing two 5-pound bags of cooked grilled chicken breast fillets with rib meat, health officials said. They were sent to distribution centers for food service sales in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Ohio.",
      "There have been no confirmed reports of illness linked to the consumption of the recalled products. Officials said the problem was discovered by a third-party laboratory, which tested the chicken fillets and reported a positive result for Listeria monocytogenes, a type of disease-causing bacteria that can infect people when they eat food that has been contaminated with it.",
      "The bacteria can be found in a number of places, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including soil, water, sewage, vegetation and animals. It can survive and grow even when products it contaminates are refrigerated, and is generally transmitted when food is \"harvested, processed, prepared, packed, transported, or stored in manufacturing or production environments contaminated with L. monocytogenes,\" the FDA says.",
      "Listeria infections are the third-leading cause of death from foodborne illness in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which estimates that 1,250 people contract the infection each year and 172 people die from it.",

    "summary": "To mark Martin Luther King Jr's birthday, \"Sunday Morning\" talks with some of those who were engaged from the very beginning of the civil rights movement, from sit-ins and marches to the Supreme Court.",
    "story": [
      "For 40 years, Martin Luther King Day has been a federal holiday. But with his legacy and landmarks of the civil rights era no longer set in stone, we thought it might be a good time to look back at some events from the tumultuous decade between 1955 to 1965, and meet people who lived them.",
      "Tampa lunch counter sit-in",
      "Arthenia Joyner became a prominent lawyer, and a Florida state senator. But in February 1960, Joyner, then 17, was one of 20 Black high school students picked by the NAACP to take part in a sit-in at a Whites-only lunch counter. The old Woolworth's in downtown Tampa, Florida, is just a gutted shell now.",
      "Similar sit-ins by students took place across the South.",
      "Asked about being scared of taking part in the sit-in, Joyner replied, \"There are things that are bigger than fear. Older folks thought that you're taking a heck of a chance, you could get killed. Why are you doing this? Because we have a right to fight for respect and dignity, and we are gonna do it. It's time for a change.\"",
      "Joyner was a fifth grader in 1954, when the Supreme Court ruled unanimously, in Brown v. Board of Education, that segregated schools were unconstitutional. \"It said that I was equal,\" she said. \"I was entitled to have schools like the ones that the White kids went to. That inspired me.\"",
      "Montgomery bus boycott",
      "On Dec. 1, 1955, Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a White passenger on a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama. What came next was the Montgomery bus boycott. Approximately 40,000 Black Montgomerians decided it was time. They walked, or took Black-owned taxis, or carpooled, rather than riding the bus, for over a year.",
      "Their spokesman: a young, unknown Martin Luther King, Jr., advocating non-violent, passive resistance.",
      "King and Parks' lawyer was Fred Gray. Just out of law school, 26 years old, he won the U.S. Supreme Court case that ended segregation on Alabama's buses, and by extension all public transportation.",
      "It was the first of four big civil rights cases \u2013 Browder v. Gayle (1956) on equal protection; NAACP v. Alabama (1958) on freedom of association; Gomillion v. Lightfoot (1960) on racial gerrymandering; and N.Y. Times v. Sullivan (1964) on free speech \u2013 that Gray would win before the Supreme Court by the age of 35. \"It was just taking one step at a time, and in my mind was to ultimately file lawsuits [that] would destroy everything segregated I could find,\" he said.",
      "Gray, now 95, winner of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, was the titan of the civil rights movement the public didn't see at the head of a march. He was in court.",
      "Without those lawsuits, he was asked, would any of what we consider the civil rights movement achievements of those ten years have been possible? \"I don't think so,\" he replied.",
      "On television",
      "What else was pushing change? Television. On the evening news, images of non-violence being met with brutality. The Civil Rights Act passed in 1964. Martin Luther King Jr won the Nobel Peace Prize.",
      "But the confrontations didn't stop.",
      "\"Bloody Sunday\" \u2013 Selma, Alabama, March 7, 1965, at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge. This was not the peaceful march from Selma to Montgomery to promote voting rights that King and other movement leaders had spent months planning, staying with the Jackson family in Selma.",
      "\"The world had a Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr,\" said Jawana Jackson. \"I had an Uncle Martin that read me bedtime stories and offered me cookies.\"",
      "Jawana was four at the time. Her father, a dentist, and her mother, a teacher, saved everything, aware that they were preserving history. The house and its contents have been acquired by the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, and moved there. It opens to the public in June.",
      "\"This house, for a brief period of time, belonged to the world,\" said Jawana. \"History is portable. The history, and the message of the Jackson house, can be told anywhere, but it must be told.\"",
      "Here, after Bloody Sunday, coordinating with President Lyndon Johnson and convincing the federal courts to let the march to Montgomery go ahead consumed these men. On March 15, as President Johnson spoke, 70 million Americans watched.",
      "\"Really it's all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice,\" said Johnson. \"And we shall overcome.\"",
      "On March 21, marchers set off from Selma protected \u2013 not beaten \u2013 by law enforcement. By the time they reached Montgomery four days later, there were 25,000 (Jawana and her mother among them).",
      "On the sixth of August 1965, LBJ signed the Voting Rights Act, considered by many the crowning achievement of the Civil Rights Era. Lately, attorney Fred Gray has watched as the Supreme Court chips away at it and other milestones he's devoted his life to making the law of the land.",
      "He says he believes the clock has turned back: \"But we can't give up. We can't look at saying it's turning back and then say, 'Well, I give up.' We were arrested. We were put in jail. We suffered all those things. But we didn't stop.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump pledged to back GOP Rep. Julia Letlow if she launches a bid in the Louisiana Senate race.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump endorsed a potential primary challenger to Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy late Saturday, encouraging Rep. Julia Letlow to run for the seat held by the Republican who has occasionally broken with his party.",
      "Mr. Trump praised Letlow in a post on Truth Social while pledging to back the Republican congresswoman if she launches a bid in the Louisiana Senate race.",
      "\"Should she decide to enter this Race, Julia Letlow has my Complete and Total Endorsement. RUN, JULIA, RUN!!!\" the president said.",
      "Cassidy, who's seeking a third term in the Senate, was one of seven Senate Republicans who voted to convict Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol in 2021. A medical doctor, Cassidy has also been at odds with the administration in recent months over HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s leadership.",
      "Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance Kennedy's nomination out of committee in February, cementing his confirmation to the post. Despite expressing misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he has raised about vaccines for decades, Cassidy ultimately supported him, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration. But since then, Cassidy has broken with the HHS secretary on multiple occasions, including calling for the postponement of key vaccine advisory panel meetings and slamming a change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants.",
      "Still, the Louisiana Republican has repeatedly emphasized his cooperation with the administration in recent months. Late last year, Cassidy, who leads the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, worked to spearhead a new approach to address health care costs that Mr. Trump had touted. Amid a push to extend health insurance tax credits by Democrats, Cassidy introduced a measure to put funds into health savings accounts as the president pushed for sending money directly to Americans rather than insurance companies.",
      "Cassidy responded to Mr. Trump's post on social media Saturday.",
      "\"I'm proudly running for re-election as a principled conservative who gets things done for the people of Louisiana,\" Cassidy said in a post on X. \"If Congresswoman Letlow decides to run I am confident I will win.\"",
      "Letlow, who became the first Republican woman elected to represent Louisiana in Congress in 2021, has not previously announced a Senate bid. She came to the House after winning a special election for Louisiana's 5th Congressional District following the death of her husband, who died in 2020 from complications related to COVID-19 before he could be sworn into office.",
      "Letlow thanked the president for his support in a post on X Saturday.",
      "\"I'm honored to have President Trump's endorsement and trust. My mission is clear: to ensure the nation our children inherit is safer and stronger,\" Letlow said. \"This United States Senate seat belongs to the people of Louisiana, because we deserve conservative leadership that will not waver.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/senior-tax-deduction-6000-impact-refund-aarp/",
    "published": "Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:07:08 -0500",
    "summary": "A new tax deduction for senior citizens is kicking in this tax season, potentially providing bigger refunds to millions, the AARP says.",
    "story": [
      "A new $6,000 tax deduction for Americans 65 and older could boost refunds for millions of older taxpayers, putting an average of about $670 more in their pockets this year, according to advocacy group AARP.",
      "But some older Americans could see far more. AARP notes that taxpayers in the 22% tax bracket \u2014 roughly those earning between $44,000 and the deduction's $75,000 income cap \u2014 could save as much as $1,320 per person.",
      "\"The benefits could be vast,\" said Bill Sweeney, AARP's senior vice president of government affairs, in a conference call Thursday. \"The bonus deduction will run through 2028 \u2014 that is four years of immediate relief at a time when older Americans are facing really high costs.\"",
      "The $670 figure is based on a 2025\u00a0analysis\u00a0by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which assessed the impact of the new deduction included in Republican lawmakers' tax and spending law, known as the \"big, beautiful bill\" act.",
      "The tax break comes as seniors tell AARP they are struggling to keep pace with the rising cost of medicine, food and other basic expenses, said Nancy LeaMond, the group's chief advocacy and engagement officer.",
      "\"In focus groups last fall, we heard about people still working long after they thought they'd be retired,\" she said. \"Sometimes in the world we live in, $600 doesn't sound like a lot, but we can tell you, based on conversations with our members, that it is a very, very significant help to them.\"",
      "AARP officials expressed concern that some older Americans may miss out on the new senior deduction because they are unaware of the tax break, which takes effect for the 2025 tax season. The IRS will start accepting tax filings on Jan. 26.",
      "Who qualifies for the $6,000 senior deduction?",
      "People who turned 65 by Dec. 31, 2025, are eligible for the new deduction,\u00a0according to the IRS. The deduction provides $6,000 for each qualifying individual, or $12,000 for married couples who both qualify.",
      "The tax break is subject to income limits. Single filers 65 and older qualify for the full $6,000 deduction if their modified adjusted gross income was below $75,000 last year, while married couples must earn less than $175,000 to receive the full $12,000.",
      "The deduction is reduced by six cents for every $1 above those thresholds, and is fully phased out for single filers earning more than $175,000 and married couples earning more than $250,000.",
      "Individuals also need a work-authorized Social Security number to qualify for the senior deduction, H&R Block notes.",
      "Can you claim the tax break if you take the standard deduction?",
      "Yes, the deduction is available to people who itemize, as well as for those who take the standard deduction, which stands at $15,750 for single filers and $31,500 for married couples filing jointly, according to H&R Block.",
      "The new tax break comes on top of an existing $2,000 deduction for seniors. Combined with the standard deduction, that means single filers 65 and older can deduct a total of $23,750, while married couples can deduct up to $46,700, H&R Block said.",
      "Does this mean my Social Security income won't be taxed?",
      "No, because this is a deduction that beneficiaries can use to lower their taxable income. But it\u00a0doesn't specifically apply to Social Security benefits, which remain subject to federal income taxes.",
      "However, the deduction will benefit seniors by lowering their taxable income, shielding more of it from federal income taxes and providing more money in their pockets, Sweeney of the AARP said.",
      "H&R Block notes that Americans who aren't yet receiving Social Security can still claim the $6,000 deduction.",

      "The woman had been working at a tourist accommodation on the island for about six weeks.",
      "A spokesperson with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed to CBC News that they're aware of the investigation in Australia. \"We were saddened to hear about the loss of this young person, and our hearts go out to the family and all those impacted,\" the spokesperson told CBC News.",
      "Local mayor George Seymour\ufeff told 9News the last fatal dingo attack on the island was 25 years ago and that there had been \"an escalation of aggressive dingo activity\" in recent years.",
      "\"A big part of what (the rangers) do is to try and separate dingoes from humans, but we're continuing to have this situation of dingoes, and in some ways it's inevitable that there will be a fatality, given how many bites and attacks are happening over the years,\" Seymour told 9News.",
      "Three years ago, a pack of dingoes mauled a 23-year-old jogger in an attack police said was almost fatal. The dogs had driven the woman into the surf before a tourist came to her rescue, beating off the dingoes. Police said the man had saved her life.",
      "About 200 dingoes roam free on K'gari and are a protected native species at the World Heritage-listed national park.",
      "The younger animals have become more aggressive and less fearful of humans since tourists returned in large numbers following the COVID-19 pandemic.",

      "The death toll in Spain's\u00a0deadliest rail disaster\u00a0in over a decade rose to 41 Tuesday, as the country began three days of national mourning for the victims of the high-speed collision.",
      "The crash took place near Adamuz in the southern Andalusia region late Sunday night, when a high-speed train operated by private rail company Iryo, going to Madrid from Malaga, derailed, straying into the path of an oncoming train operated by Spain's public Renfe network, which also then derailed.",
      "The cause of the crash remains a mystery, though investigators say they will focus on coach six of the Iryo train, which they believe was the first to derail. The Guardia Civil national police force asked for that carriage to be left where it came to a rest so it can be examined.",
      "Rail experts \"extremely surprised\" by crash on straight track",
      "\"There are many pieces of the puzzle we must fit together,\" Spain's Transport Minister Oscar Puente told the country's\u00a0Onda Cero radio\u00a0network Tuesday.",
      "Puente called the crash \"extremely strange\" on Monday because it happened on a flat stretch of track that had been renovated in May, adding that \"all the railway experts are extremely surprised.\"",
      "\"Nothing seems to suggest anything was wrong with it,\" he said Tuesday, adding that freshly laid track can sometimes exhibit \"youthful sins.\"",
      "Investigators studying the scene of the accident found a broken joint on the rails, which likely created a gap that widened as trains passed over it, the Reuters news agency said Tuesday, citing a source briefed on the initial investigation. The faulty joint could prove key to determining the cause of the accident, the source said.",
      "Puente, however, warned against drawing any conclusions based on \"mere speculation.\"",
      "\"When the train went off the rails, it produced a ton of fractures in the track, for about 200 meters [yards]. And so for the first fracture in the track, the key is to determine \u2014 and currently no expert can say for certain \u2014 if this fracture was a cause or a consequence,\" he told Onda Cero.",
      "\"That is the crux of this whole thing, or one of them, knowing what came first \u2014 the fracturing of the track and then the derailment, or if the derailment caused the fracture in the track,\" Puente said, adding that if there was an issue with the track before the crash, investigators would still \"have to find out why.\"",
      "Spain's chief high-speed train engineer \u00c1lvaro Aznar told CBS News on Monday that the \"earliest signs point to mechanical failure\" as the cause of the crash, but authorities have stressed that it could take weeks, if not longer, to know for sure.",
      "Death toll could still climb as recovery work continues",
      "Residents were among the first on the scene.",
      "\"There were people with missing limbs,\" said one man, who shuttled survivors to safety on his four-wheeler. \"They were crying. Nobody was born to see this.\"",
      "The death toll from the accident climbed to 41 on Monday evening after the body of another passenger was found in one of the Iryo train carriages, according to the the regional government.",
      "More than 120 people were injured and 39, including four children, were still hospitalized on Tuesday as the nation began three days of mourning.",

    "published": "Tue, 20 Jan 2026 06:35:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump says the U.K. decision to hand a strategic island to Mauritius, which he previously supported, was stupid, and justification for his attempt to acquire Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0President Trump has called the U.K.'s decision to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius \u2014 a deal his administration previously supported \u2014 an act of \"great stupidity\" that further justified his desire for the U.S. to acquire Greenland. One of the islands, Diego Garcia, is the site of a key U.K.-U.S. military base in the Indian Ocean.",
      "\"Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER,\" Mr. Trump said early Tuesday on his own Truth Social platform. \"There is no doubt that China and Russia have noticed this act of total weakness. These are International Powers who only recognize STRENGTH, which is why the United States of America, under my leadership, is now, after only one year, respected like never before. The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired. Denmark and its European Allies have to DO THE RIGHT THING. Thank you for your attention to this matter. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP.\"",
      "Mr. Trump issued his statement as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Mike Johnson, a Republican, was in the U.K. to address the British parliament, where he told lawmakers the U.S. and U.K. had \"always been able to work through our differences calmly as friends. We will continue to do that. I want to assure you this morning that that is still the case.\"",
      "The Chagos Islands were separated from Mauritius, which was then a British colony, in 1965.",
      "The U.K. purchased the islands for the equivalent of around $4 million, CBS News partner BBC News reported, but Mauritius had long argued that it was forced to give the islands away in order to achieve its independence in 1968. The U.K. invited the U.S. to build a military base on the island of Diego Garcia, and it has become a cornerstone of American defense infrastructure in the vast Indian Ocean region.",
      "In 2019, the International Court of Justice issued a non-binding ruling that called on the U.K. to give up control of the Chagos Islands, saying it had wrongfully forced out the people living on Diego Garcia to make way for the military base.",
      "That ruling, in part, prompted the deal reached in 2024 for the U.K. to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. As part of the agreement, Britain got to maintain control of the military base on Diego Garcia through a 99-year lease, at a cost to the U.K. of about $136 million per year.",
      "The Trump administration previously supported the Chagos Islands deal, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio issuing a statement in May last year saying, \"following a comprehensive interagency review, the Trump Administration determined that this agreement secures the long-term, stable, and effective operation of the joint U.S.-UK military facility at Diego Garcia.\"",
      "Rubio said at the time that Mr. Trump had \"expressed his support for this monumental achievement during his meeting with Prime Minister Starmer at the White House,\" calling the base \"a critical asset for regional and global security.\"",
      "In a statement sent to CBS News on Tuesday, a U.K. government spokesperson said Britain \"will never compromise on our national security,\" noting that the agreement with Mauritius was struck \"because the base on Diego Garcia was under threat after court decisions undermined our position and would have prevented it operating as intended in future.\"",
      "\"This deal secures the operations of the joint U.S.-U.K. base on Diego Garcia for generations, with robust provisions for keeping its unique capabilities intact and our adversaries out,\" the British government said, noting that it had previously been \"publicly welcomed by the U.S., Australia and all other Five Eyes allies, as well as key international partners including India, Japan and South Korea.\"",

      "A surfer had minor injuries from being bitten by a shark Tuesday in the fourth attack off the coast of Australia's most populous state in three days. The series of attacks have prompted beach closures and warnings that swimmers should avoid the open water and go to a pool instead.",
      "The shark attacked the man's surfboard at Point Plomer, 290 miles north of the New South Wales state capital, around 9 a.m., police said in a statement.",
      "The man was lucky to survive with minor cuts, Kempsey-Crescent Head Surf Life Saving Club captain Matt Worrall said.",
      "\"The board seemed to take most of the impact,\" Worrall told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \"He made his own way into shore where he was assisted by locals.\"",
      "The bystanders drove the 39-year-old man to a hospital and he was later discharged.",
      "In the earlier attacks, a man and a boy suffered critical leg wounds and the surfboard of another boy was bitten by sharks at Sydney locations Sunday and Monday.",
      "Beaches along New South Wales' northern coast and northern Sydney were closed Tuesday and local authorities said Sydney's northern beaches would remain closed to swimmers and surfers for 48 hours. Electronic drumlines that alert authorities when a large shark has taken bait were deployed off the Sydney coast.",
      "Authorities warned that recent rainfall has left the water off area beaches murky, which increased the risk of bull shark attacks. Bull sharks are responsible for most attacks around Sydney.",
      "\"If anyone's thinking of heading into the surf this morning anywhere along the northern beaches, think again. We have such poor water quality that's really conducive to some bull shark activity,\" Surf Life Saving NSW chief executive Steve Pearce said.",
      "\"If you're thinking about going for a swim, just go to a local pool because at this stage, we're advising that beaches are unsafe,\" Peace added.",
      "Police say boy's friends saved his life",
      "On Sunday, a 12-year-old boy was attacked after jumping from a 20-foot ledge known as Jump Rock near Shark Beach inside Sydney Harbor. Police have credited the boy's friends with saving his life by jumping from the cliff during the attack and dragging him back to shore.",
      "\"Those actions of those young men are brave under the circumstances and very confronting injuries for those boys to see,\" Supt. Joseph McNulty said.",
      "News media have reported that the boy lost both legs in the attack.",
      "Around noon Monday, an 11-year-old boy was on a surfboard that was attacked by a shark at Dee Why Beach, an ocean beach north of Manly. The shark bit off a chunk of the board, but the boy escaped uninjured.",
      "A surfer in his 20s was bitten on a leg by a shark off North Steyne Beach on the Pacific Ocean coast in the northern suburb of Manly at 6:20 p.m. Monday, police said. Bystanders pulled him from the water before an ambulance took him to a hospital in a critical condition.",
      "All three Sydney beaches have some form of shark protection netting. It was not immediately clear where the attacks occurred in relation to that netting.",
      "Pearce said the scene of the latest attack was isolated and did not have shark netting.",

      "Juanma Moreno, the president of Andalusia, the southern Spanish region where the accident happened, confirmed the new death toll in an afternoon press conference. Efforts to recover the bodies from the two wrecked train cars continued, he added.",
      "The impact tossed the second train's lead carriages off the track, sending them plummeting down a 13-foot slope. Some bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno said earlier in the day, describing the wreckage as a \"mass of twisted metal\" with bodies likely still to be found inside. Some passengers were catapulted through windows and their bodies were found hundreds of meters from the crash site, Moreno previously said.",
      "The crash occurred Sunday at 7:45 p.m. when the tail end of a train carrying 289 passengers on the route from Malaga to the capital, Madrid, went off the rails. It slammed into an incoming train traveling from Madrid to Huelva, another southern Spanish city, according to rail operator Adif.",
      "The head of the second train, which was carrying nearly 200 passengers, took the brunt of the impact, Spanish Transport Minister \u00d3scar Puente said, adding that it appeared the largest number of the deaths occurred in those carriages.",
      "Authorities said all the survivors had been rescued in the early morning.",

He also said the train that jumped the track was less than 4 years old. That train belonged to the private company Iryo while the second train, which took the brunt of the impact, was part of Spain's public train company Renfe.",

    "story": [
      "America's European allies stood united Monday against President Trump's escalating campaign to take control of Greenland,\u00a0accusing him of blackmail with a new threat of tariffs if they continue rejecting his bid for the U.S. to acquire the vast island. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, appeared to hint that he was still willing to use the U.S. military to achieve his objective.",
      "In a message sent to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re and shared with other NATO allies, Mr. Trump said that due to the decision to\u00a0award someone other than himself the Nobel Peace Prize this year, he no longer feels \"an obligation to think purely of Peace,\" and that he \"can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America.\"",
      "In the next sentence, Mr. Trump refers to his controversial demand that the U.S. take ownership of Greenland, which has been a territory of American ally Denmark for centuries. He renews his claim that only full U.S. control can prevent the\u00a0strategic Arctic island from falling into the hands of China or Russia.",
      "But speaking to reporters at Palm Beach International Airport late Monday night after attending\u00a0the college football championship game\u00a0in Miami, Mr. Trump said he doesn't care about the Nobel prize, though he continued to say Norway controls who gets it.",
      "\"If anybody thinks that Norway doesn't - doesn't control the Nobel prize, they're just kidding. They (the Peace prize decision makers) have a board, but it's controlled by Norway. And I don't care what Norway says. But I really don't care about that. What I care about is saving lives. And I think I've saved tens of millions of lives.\"",
      "The president also said he thinks European leaders will be conciliatory about Greenland at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. \"I don't think they're going to push back too much,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Look, we have to have it, they have to have this done. They can't protect it.\"",
      "On his Truth Social platform early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he \"had a very good telephone call with Mark Rutte, the Secretary General of NATO, concerning Greenland. I agreed to a meeting of the various parties in Davos, Switzerland. As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back \u2014 On that, everyone agrees!",
      "He also posted a picture of himself claiming Greenland as a U.S. territory, with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at his side.",
      "Trump's claims about Greenland and U.S. security",
      "America's closest allies in NATO have rejected Mr. Trump's argument, along with U.S. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, that the U.S. needs to own Greenland for security reasons.",
      "They note that Greenland already falls under the transatlantic alliance's protection as a Danish territory, that the U.S. has had at least one military base on the island since World War II and Denmark has given an open invitation for Washington to boost that defense presence in partnership with its allies.",
      "Despite those facts, and efforts by Denmark and other European NATO members to show an understanding of and willingness to address rising competition over\u00a0control of vital new shipping lanes around the resource-rich island, Mr. Trump claims again in his message to Norway's leader that \"the World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland.\"",
      "He argues that Denmark is incapable of securing the Arctic territory in the face of Russian and Chinese threats \u2014 threats that Senator Mark Warner, the Democratic vice chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee,\u00a0called fictitious over the weekend.",
      "\"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China,\" Mr. Trump wrote, ignoring the fact that, for almost 80 years, since the U.S. and its European allies committed to the principle of joint security with NATO's founding treaty, Greenland's protection has been a shared responsibility.",
      "Mr. Trump questions in the note, as he's done previously, Denmark's right to any claim over Greenland, arguing that the basis is only that \"a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also.\"",
      "Denmark became the colonial power in Greenland in the early 18th century, about 50 years before the United States became a sovereign nation with its own navy. Greenland remained a Danish colony until 1953, when the island gained its current semi-autonomy.",
      "Though the population is tiny at around 60,000 people, Greenland has its own elected government, and both the island's leaders and the Greenlandic people have made it abundantly clear that they do not want to become part of the U.S.",
      "Norway's leader responds to Trump's message",
      "The Norwegian government\u00a0shared a statement on Monday from Prime Minister St\u00f8re in which he confirms that he received Mr. Trump's message on Sunday afternoon.",
      "He said it came in response to a text message he'd sent along with Finland's President Alexander Stubb.",
      "\"In our message to Trump we conveyed our opposition to his announced tariff increases against Norway, Finland and select other countries. We pointed to the need to de-escalate and proposed a telephone conversation between Trump, Stubb and myself on the same day. The response from Trump came shortly after the message was sent,\" St\u00f8re said in the statement, adding that it was Mr. Trump's \"decision to share his message with other NATO leaders.\"",
      "\"Norway's position on Greenland is clear. Greenland is a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and Norway fully supports the Kingdom of Denmark on this matter. We also support that NATO in a responsible way is taking steps to strengthen security and stability in the Arctic,\" said St\u00f8re.",
      "He added, \"As regards the Nobel Peace Prize, I have clearly explained, including to President Trump what is well known, the prize is awarded by an independent Nobel Committee and not the Norwegian Government.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said Monday the president \"believes Greenland is a strategically important location that is critical from the standpoint of national security,\" and is \"confident Greenlanders would be better served if protected by the United States from modern threats in the Arctic region.\"",
      "U.K. leader doubts Trump will use U.S. military to take Greenland",
      "Mr. Trump stunned America's NATO allies over the weekend by\u00a0threatening to impose new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European nations if they continue to reject his demands to take over Greenland.",
      "After holding talks among themselves on Sunday, the eight countries issued a joint statement saying they were \"committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest,\" while reiterating their support for Denmark and Greenland.",
      "They said they were \"ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind,\" and warned that threats of tariffs undermine \"transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\"",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has maintained good relations with Mr. Trump and spoke with him on the phone Sunday, acknowledged in televised remarks on Monday morning that the Arctic region \"will require greater attention, greater investment and stronger collective defense\" and said the U.S. would \"be central to that effort and the U.K. stands ready to contribute fully alongside our allies, through NATO.\"",
      "\"But there is a principle here that cannot be set aside, because it goes to the heart of how stable and trusted international cooperation works, and so any decision about the future status of Greenland belongs to the people of Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark alone,\" said Starmer.",
      "\"Denmark is a close ally of the U.K. and of the U.S. \u2014 a proud NATO member that has stood shoulder to shoulder with us, including at real human cost in recent decades,\" Starmer said, alluding to Danish troops fighting alongside U.S. and British forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, as part of the NATO alliance.",
      "\"Alliances endure because they're built on respect and partnership, not pressure. That is why I said the use of tariffs against allies is completely wrong. It is not the right way to resolve differences within an alliance, nor is it helpful to frame efforts to strengthen Greenland's security as a justification for economic pressure,\" he said. \"A trade war is in no one's interest.\"",
      "As for Mr. Trump not ruling out the use of the American military to seize territory from a NATO ally, Starmer said he didn't believe it would come to that.",
      "\"I don't, actually,\" he said. \"I think this can and should be resolved through calm discussion, but with the application of principles I've set out in terms of who decides the future of Greenland.\"",

    "summary": "Valentino Garavani's high-glamour gowns were fashion show staples for nearly half a century.",
    "story": [
      "Valentino Garavani, the jet-set Italian designer whose high-glamour gowns \u2014 often in his trademark shade of \"Valentino red\" \u2014 were fashion show staples for nearly half a century, has died at home in Rome, his foundation announced\u00a0Monday on social media. He was 93.",
      "\"Valentino Garavani was not only a constant guide and inspiration for all of us, but a true source of light, creativity and vision,\u2033 the foundation said in the statement.",
      "His body will lie in repose at the foundation's headquarters in Rome on Wednesday and Thursday. The funeral will be held Friday at the Basilica Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome's Piazza della Repubblica.",
      "Universally known by his first name, Valentino was adored by generations of royals, first ladies and movie stars, from Jackie Kennedy Onassis to Julia Roberts and Queen Rania of Jordan, who swore the designer always made them look and feel their best.",
      "When the empress of Iran, Farah Pahlavi, escaped the country during the 1979 revolution, she was wearing a coat made by Valentino.",
      "\"I know what women want,\" he once remarked. \"They want to be beautiful.\"",
      "Never one for edginess or statement dressing, Valentino made precious few fashion faux-pas throughout his nearly half-century-long career, which stretched from his early days in Rome in the 1960s through to his retirement in 2008.",
      "His fail-safe designs made Valentino the king of the red carpet, the go-to man for A-listers' awards ceremony needs. His sumptuous gowns have graced countless Academy Awards, notably in 2001, when Roberts wore a vintage black and white column to accept her best actress statue.",
      "Cate Blanchett also wore Valentino \u2014 a one-shouldered number in butter-yellow silk \u2014 when she won the Oscar for best supporting actress in 2005.",
      "Valentino was also behind the long-sleeved lace dress Jacqueline Kennedy wore for her wedding to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1968. It caused a sensation in the United States, and in 1970, Valentino was the first Italian designer to open a shop in New York.",
      "Kennedy and Valentino were close friends for decades, and for a spell the one-time U.S. first lady wore almost exclusively Valentino. He was also close to Diana, Princess of Wales, who often donned his sumptuous gowns.",
      "Over the years Valentino would elevate the \"Made in Italy\" label to global prominence.",
      "Beyond his signature orange-tinged shade of red, other Valentino trademarks included bows, ruffles, lace and embroidery; in short, feminine, flirty embellishments that added to the dresses' beauty and hence to that of the wearers.",
      "Perpetually tanned and always impeccably dressed \u2014 \"I only like beautiful things,\" he told the Italian edition of Elle magazine in 2007 \u2014 Valentino shared the lifestyle of his jet-set patrons. In addition to his 152-foot yacht and an art collection including works by Picasso and Miro, the couturier owned a 17th-century chateau near Paris with a garden said to boast more than a million roses.",
      "Valentino and his longtime partner Giancarlo Giammetti flitted among their homes \u2014 which also included places in New York, London, Rome, Capri and Gstaad, Switzerland \u2014 traveling with their pack of pugs. The pair regularly received A-list friends and patrons, including Madonna and Gwyneth Paltrow.",
      "\"When I see somebody and unfortunately she's relaxed and running around in jogging trousers and without any makeup ... I feel very sorry,\" the designer told RTL television in a 2007 interview. \"For me, woman is like a beautiful, beautiful flower bouquet. She has always to be sensational, always to please, always to be perfect, always to please the husband, the lover, everybody. Because we are born to show ourselves always at our best.\"",
      "Valentino was born into a well-off family in the northern Italian town of Voghera on May 11, 1932. He said it was his childhood love of cinema that set him down the fashion path.",
      "\"I was crazy for silver screen, I was crazy for beauty, to see all those movie stars being sensation, well dressed, being always perfect,\" he explained in the 2007 television interview.",
      "After studying fashion in Milan and Paris, he spent much of the 1950s working for established Paris-based designer Jean Desses and later Guy Laroche before striking out on his own. He founded the house of Valentino on Rome's Via Condotti in 1959.",
      "From the beginning, Giammetti was by his side, handling the business aspect while Valentino used his natural charm to build a client base among the world's rich and fabulous.",
      "After some early financial setbacks \u2014 Valentino's tastes were always lavish, and the company spent with abandon \u2014 the brand took off.",
      "Early fans included Italian screen sirens Gina Lollobrigida and Sophia Loren, as well as Hollywood stars Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn. Legendary American Vogue editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland also took the young designer under her wing.",
      "Over the years, Valentino's empire expanded as the designer added ready-to-wear, menswear and accessories lines to his stable. Valentino and Giammetti sold the label to an Italian holding company for an estimated $300 million in 1998. Valentino would remain in a design role for another decade.",
      "In 2007, the couturier feted his 45th anniversary in fashion with a three-day-long blowout in Rome, capped with a grand ball in the Villa Borghese gallery.",
      "Valentino retired in 2008 and was briefly replaced by fellow Italian Alessandra Facchinetti, who had stepped into Tom Ford's shoes at Gucci before being sacked after two seasons.",
      "Facchinetti's tenure at Valentino proved equally short. As early as her first show for the label, rumors swirled that she was already on her way out, and just about one year after she was hired, Facchinetti was indeed replaced by two longtime accessories designers at the brand, Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pier Paolo Piccioli.",
      "Chiuri left to helm Dior in 2016, and Piccioli continued to lead the house through a golden period that drew on the launch of the Rockstud pump with Chiuri and his own signature color, a shade of fuchsia called Pink PP. He left the house in 2024, later joining Balenciaga, and has been replaced by Alessandro Michele, who revived Gucci's stars with romantic, genderless styles.",
      "Valentino is owned by Qatar's Mayhoola, which controls a 70% stake, and the French luxury conglomerate Kering, which owns 30% with an option to take full control in 2028 or 2029. Richard Bellini was named CEO last September.",
      "Valentino has been the subject of several retrospectives, including one at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, which is housed in a wing of Paris' Louvre Museum. He was also the subject of a hit 2008 documentary, \"Valentino: The Last Emperor,\" that chronicled the end of his career in fashion.",
      "In 2011, Valentino and Giammetti launched what they called a \"virtual museum,\" a free desktop application that allows viewers to feast their eyes on about 300 of the designer's iconic pieces.",
      "AFP  \n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "As rescue teams looked for survivors, hundreds of people were outside the building. Among them was shopowner Yasmeen Bano, who said, \"We've been left high and dry, reduced to zero; 20 years of hard work, all gone,\" according to Reuters.",

      "Iran's national police chief said Monday that people who were \"deceived\" into joining weeks-long protests deemed \"riots\" by Iranian authorities would receive lighter punishment if they turned themselves in within three days.",
      "\"Young people who became unwittingly involved in the riots are considered to be deceived individuals, not enemy soldiers\" and \"will be treated with leniency by the Islamic Republic system,\" Ahmad-Reza Radan said on Iranian state television, adding that such individuals had \"a maximum of three days\" to surrender.",
      "Demonstrations sparked in late December by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests widely seen as the biggest challenge to Iran's hardline Islamic rulers in years, though they subsided after a brutal crackdown that sources tell CBS News saw between 12,000 and 20,000 people killed.",
      "Security officials cited by the semi-official Tasnim news agency, which is associated with the powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, said late last week that around 3,000 people had been arrested in connection with the demonstrations. Rights groups say the number is likely closer to 20,000.",
      "Iranian officials say the demonstrations were peaceful before turning into \"riots,\" which they accuse the country's arch-foes the United States and Israel of fomenting to destabilize the regime, though they have presented no evidence to back up the claim.",
      "Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Saturday that authorities \"must break the back of the seditionists,\" adding that domestic and foreign \"criminals\" would not be spared punishment.",
      "\"We hold the American president guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has leveled against the Iranian nation,\" he added.",
      "The Iranian regime has already begun punishing people who were deemed to have supported the protests in any way, even if they didn't go out onto the streets themselves. Last week, Tasnim quoted Iran's Attorney General Mohammad Movahedi Azad as saying officials from the country's judiciary were \"obliged to identify the property of the 'terrorists' and report it to the prosecutors,\" as a prominent businessman who closed his cafes in solidarity with the protests was detained and had his assets seized.",

      "The clips aired Sunday night on several channels run by the state-controlled IRIB network. They showed Pahlavi and presented claims that some Iranian security forces had \"laid down their weapons and swore an oath of allegiance to the people\" during the protests.",
      "Pahlavi has lived outside of Iran for almost 50 years, but he presented himself during the two weeks of unrest as a viable opposition leader, ready to step in and replace the Islamic Republic's hardline rulers.",

    "summary": "The publisher of the Daily Mail tabloid denies claims by Prince Harry and other celebrities of \"unlawful information gathering.\"",
    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Prince Harry was back in London on Monday, sitting in the U.K.'s highest court to take part in the third and final of his outstanding legal battles against Britain's tabloid newspapers.",
      "Harry is among the high-profile claimants, along with Sir Elton John and actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, who have accused the Associated Newspapers group of \"unlawful information gathering.\"",
      "The 41-year-old royal, who lives in California, and his fellow celebrities claim the company, which publishes the Daily Mail and the linked MailOnline website, illegally snooped on them by hiring private investigators to hack their phones, bug their cars and access private records to generate scoops.",
      "The publisher has denied all of the accusations, calling them \"preposterous smears\" and part of a coordinated effort driven by the claimants' personal dislike of the news media.",
      "In a witness submission seen by CBS News, Harry said it was, \"disturbing to feel that my every move, thought or feeling was being tracked and monitored just for the Mail to make money out of it,\" adding that the \"terrifying\" intrusion made him, \"paranoid beyond belief, isolating me.\"",
      "Harry, the Duke of Sussex, whose case is based on 14 separate newspaper stories, says the alleged illegal information gathering between 1993 and 2011 put a \"massive strain\" on his personal relationships. He has long blamed the media for the death of his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 as her vehicle was pursued by photographers on motorcycles.",
      "He listened in court Monday as his lawyer argued that there was, \"clear, systematic and sustained use of unlawful information gathering at both the Daily Mail and the Mail on Sunday.\"",
      "Testimony from several private investigators, who have said they worked on behalf of Associated Newspapers, will be used in the trial. CBS News' partner network BBC news reported Monday that Harry was expected to take the stand himself to offer evidence.",
      "During his first legal battle with the press, in 2019, against the owners of The Mirror for hacking his phone, Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to give in-person testimony in a British court in more than 130 years. Courts ruled in his favor multiple times in that case.",
      "\"The journalists who used me and the editors who sanctioned this knew full well that I was a practitioner of the 'Dark Arts,'\" private investigator Steve Whittamore said in a witness statement ahead of the trial that began Monday. \"If the information the journalists requested could have been acquired legitimately \u2026 then the newspapers would have had no need to use my particular services.\"",
      "Another witness, known as \"Detective Danno,\" claims to have been paid the equivalent of more than $1 million by the Mail for over 20 years of work for the paper.",
      "The publisher has argued that evidence from private detectives can't be trusted.",
      "Royah Nikkhah, royal editor for The Sunday Times and a CBS News contributor, said Monday that Prince William appeared to be \"full of confidence\" about his case, but \"he's not really relishing the prospect of being in court all week.\"",
      "Last year, Rupert Murdoch's right-leaning News Group Newspapers settled out of court with the royal, offering a full formal apology for \"serious intrusion\" and a multi-million dollar payout.",

      "What is the World Economic Forum?",
      "The forum is a think tank and event organizer based in Geneva whose main event \u2014 the annual meeting \u2014 debuted in 1971 in Davos, a ski-resort town of about 10,000 people at a height of about 1,500 meters (nearly 5,000 feet) in the Alps of eastern Switzerland.",
      "The first edition, hosted by forum founder Klaus Schwab, featured a gathering of business executives.",

      "This year's event runs from Jan. 19-23.",
      "What is the theme at this year's Davos forum?",
      "Davos conference organizers always trot out buzzwords for the meeting, and this year's is \"A Spirit of Dialogue\" \u2014 around five themes of cooperation, growth, investment in people, innovation and building prosperity. More than 200 sessions will tackle a wide array of issues.",
      "Critics say Davos is too much talk and not enough action to rectify gaping inequality in the world and address troubles like climate change.",
      "The world's richest people saw their fortunes surge in 2025, part of a long-running trend of widening wealth inequality, according to a\u00a0new report from anti-poverty charity Oxfam released to coincide with the forum. The wealth of billionaires grew three times faster last year than the average pace of the previous five years, reaching a record $18.3 trillion, the group said.",
      "At the same time, one in four people worldwide experiences food insecurity and regularly skips meals, Oxfam said.",

      "Organizers say 55 ministers for economy and finance, 33 ministers for foreign affairs, 34 ministers for trade, commerce and industry, and 11 central bank governors are also expected.",
      "Tech titans scheduled to be on hand include Jensen Huang of Nvidia. Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Demis Hassabis of Google DeepMind, and Arthur Mensch of France's Mistral AI.",

      "The geopolitical context has become incredibly complex this year: Trump's pronouncements and policies on subjects as diverse as Venezuela, Greenland and Iran \u2014 not to mention his tariff policies \u2014 have raised questions about America's role in the world.",
      "The advent of AI \u2014 its promise and perils \u2014 has also become a hot topic. Business executives will examine how to apply it to boost efficiency and profits; labor leaders and advocacy groups will warn of its threat to jobs and livelihoods, and policymakers will look to navigate the best way forward between regulation and right to innovate.",

      "The Sochi court didn't mention when he was sentenced, but said an appeal against the conviction had been rejected. It was the first time his arrest and conviction has been mentioned in Russian media, which usually cover judicial proceedings of foreign citizens closely.",
      "According to the court, the man sailed across the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It cited him as saying he'd met a Russian woman online and decided to visit her and that he didn't know he was forbidden to keep a weapon on his yacht while it was docked in Russia.",

      "\"He was sailing from the U.S. to New Zealand, so of course he had a firearm on board. You can't just call 911 if something goes wrong out at sea,\" Stultz said. \"He voluntarily disclosed it to them and they charged him with arms smuggling. This is an obvious set-up to get another American they can trade. He needs to be declared wrongfully detained.\"",

      "Stultz said she met last week with officials from the U.S. State Department and several American lawmakers to plead for help with her brother's case, adding that there was \"strong support for Chuck's designation as a wrongful detainee and for his release to be a priority for the U.S. government in their talks with the Russians.\"",

    "story": [
      "As the first explosions rocked his military base in Caracas, 18-year-old Saul Pereira Martinez sent his mother a simple message: \"I love you. It has begun.\"",
      "It was the night of January 3, and U.S. forces were invading Venezuela to seize the country's then-president, Nicolas Maduro, on the orders of President Donald Trump.",
      "Pereira had finished his shift on guard duty at Fort Tiuna, where Maduro was sheltered that night. Nonetheless, he would not survive the assault.",
      "Natividad Martinez, his mother, visited on Sunday the cemetery where her son's remains are buried, recalling the night it happened, and still in shock.",
      "The last time she spoke to Saul was at 2:00 am. He repeated that he loved her, and told her to take care of his two brothers, aged two and nine.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly touted the success of the stunning operation to seize Maduro, boasting that there were no casualties.",
      "But at least 83 people were killed in the operation, including 47 Venezuelan soldiers and 32 Cuban security personnel, according to the defense ministry in Caracas.",
      "\"You can't come to my country and kill people like that,\" said Martinez. \"Because (they say) 'it was a clean operation.' It wasn't clean. Do you know how many people died?\"",
      "\"A brave man\"",
      "As the attack began, 38-year-old Martinez heard explosions and began to scream, worried for the safety of her son, her husband said.",
      "After she got off the phone with him, she fell to the ground screaming his name, he said.",
      "\"I told her to stay calm, we don't know what's going on,\" said Saul's stepfather, who asked not to be identified because he works as a police officer and government security official.",
      "He believes that Saul was killed because his unit was spending the night within the security perimeter around Maduro, which made them a target for U.S. forces.",
      "On Sunday, Saul's parents were joined by his girlfriend and friends at the cemetery in southern Caracas.",
      "Saul had just completed his initial training with the Honor Guard in December and was studying at the military academy.",
      "They brought flowers, and, to the rhythm of old salsa music, the family cried, recalled anecdotes, and toasted in honor of the young soldier whom they remember as \"a brave man.\"",
      "Saul entered the military following in the footsteps of a childhood friend, who was at La Carlota air base during the U.S. attack and was wounded in the leg.",
      "His mother had applauded the decision, having earlier worried about the trajectory her son's life was on.",
      "Saul, says Natividad, went from \"partying, going here and there, doing nothing at home\" to studying, cleaning the house during his visits, and acquiring discipline.",
      "\"All human beings\"",
      "Despite the massive U.S. military deployment in the Caribbean, Mr. Trump's threats against Maduro, Martinez's family did not expect things to get this bad.",
      "\"The president didn't always stay in the same place,\" his stepfather explained, and the government maneuvered to mislead even the state security forces about Maduro's whereabouts.",
      "U.S. forces found Maduro because of inside informers, the stepfather said.",
      "\"(The death of) my son was a collateral effect of that infiltration,\" he said.",
      "Earlier this month, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said Maduro had no warning the U.S. was closing in until moments before American forces arrived.",
      "\"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro got to meet some great Americans wearing night vision goggles three nights ago,\" Hegseth said. \"He didn't know they were coming until three minutes before they arrived. In fact, his wife said, 'I think I hear aircraft outside.' They didn't know. You know why? Because every single part of that chain did their job.\"",
      "Hours after the attack, Natividad brought food for Saul to Fort Tiuna, as per their weekly schedule.",
      "She found only silence.",
      "Hours later, when the names of the fallen began to circulate, she went to the battalion and stood there, demanding answers.",
      "\"And they had to tell me,\" she said, staring at the cement tomb where mourners had spelled out Saul's name in yellow, blue, and white flower petals.",
      "Her son, like other soldiers, was honored by the government, which promoted him posthumously.",
      "Natividad said that some seemed not to mourn these deaths because of the political polarization that has divided the nation under Maduro's rule, and that of Hugo Chavez before him.",
      "\"Those who died are also human beings. They are all Venezuelans. On one side or the other, they are all human beings, they all have people who mourn them,\" she said.",
      "Shaken but still stoic, Natividad said she felt proud of her son.",
      "\"He died for his country,\" she said. \"Regardless of what they say, to me, my son was a patriot, and that's what matters to me.\"",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. strikes in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific have\u00a0killed more than 100 people\u00a0on boats that Washington claims were ferrying drugs from Venezuela.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-europe-greeland/",
    "published": "Mon, 19 Jan 2026 02:32:25 -0500",
    "summary": "Europeans were reeling Sunday from President Trump's announcement\u200b that eight countries will face a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland.",
    "story": [
      "Europeans were reeling Sunday from President Trump's announcement that eight countries will face a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland.",
      "The responses to Mr. Trump's decision ranged from saying it risked \"a dangerous downward spiral\" to predicting that \"China and Russia must be having a field day.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's threat sets up a potentially dangerous test of U.S. partnerships in Europe. Several European countries have sent troops to Greenland in recent days, saying they are there for Arctic security training. Mr. Trump's announcement came Saturday as thousands of Greenlanders were wrapping up a protest outside the U.S. Consulate in the capital, Nuuk.",
      "The Republican president appeared to indicate that he was using the tariffs as leverage to force talks with Denmark and other European countries over the status of Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark that he regards as critical to U.S. national security. Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland would face the tariff.",
      "The eight countries issued a joint statement Sunday: \"As members of NATO, we are committed to strengthening Arctic security as a shared transatlantic interest. The pre-coordinated Danish exercise 'Arctic Endurance,' conducted with Allies, responds to this necessity. It poses no threat to anyone.\"",
      "The statement added: \"We stand in full solidarity with the Kingdom of Denmark and the people of Greenland. Building on the process begun last week, we stand ready to engage in a dialogue based on the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity that we stand firmly behind. Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. We will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response. We are committed to upholding our sovereignty.\"",
      "A European diplomatic source tells CBS News France is calling on all European partners to immediately make use of all relevant European steps to defend the EU's interests, including the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), known as the \"trade bazooka,\" which involves curbing imports of goods and services into the EU.",
      "There are immediate questions about how the White House could try to implement the tariffs, because the EU is a single economic zone in terms of trading. Norway and the U.K. are not part of the 27-member EU, and it was not immediately clear if Mr. Trump's tariffs would impact the entire bloc.",
      "It was also unclear how Mr. Trump could act under U.S. law, though he could cite emergency economic powers that are currently subject to a Supreme Court challenge.",
      "GOP Rep. Mike Turner of Ohio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" Sunday that \"even if he is found to have tariff authority, I don't believe he has the ability to impose tariffs for the purposes of compelling other nations to sell the United States land for the purposes of us expanding.\"",
      "Turner added that \"these are not just casual allies.\"",
      "\"Of the other allies that he's talking about putting a tariff on, seven of them are F-35 partners, three of them we have U.S. nuclear weapons on their soil and five of them we have permanent troops on their soil,\" Turner said. \"These are very strong allies.\"",
      "European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said China and Russia will benefit from the divisions between the U.S. and Europe. She added in a post on social media: \"If Greenland's security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO. Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's move also was panned domestically.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on \"Face the Nation\" Sunday that \"the only country that's frankly benefiting the most from this chaos are both Russia and China.\"",
      "\"There is no current security threat from Russia or China to Greenland,\" Warner said. \"The only security threat to Greenland right now is the United States.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, a former U.S. Navy pilot and Democrat who represents Arizona, posted that Mr. Trump's threatened tariffs on U.S. allies would make Americans \"pay more to try to get territory we don't need.\"",
      "\"Troops from European countries are arriving in Greenland to defend the territory from us. Let that sink in,\" he wrote on X. \"The damage this President is doing to our reputation and our relationships is growing, making us less safe. If something doesn't change we will be on our own with adversaries and enemies in every direction.\"",
      "Mr. Trump on Sunday night wrote on social media that, \"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that 'you have to get the Russian threat away from Greenland.' Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it. Now it is time, and it will be done!!!\"",
      "A CBS News poll released Sunday found widespread opposition among Americans to buying Greenland or taking it by military force. Seventy percent said they would oppose using federal funds to buy the territory, and 86% said they would oppose seizing it militarily.",
      "The tariffs announcement even drew blowback from Mr. Trump's populist allies in Europe.",
      "Italy's right-wing Premier Giorgia Meloni, considered one of Mr. Trump's closest allies on the continent, said Sunday she had spoken to him about the tariffs, which she described as \"a mistake.\"",
      "The deployment to Greenland of small numbers of troops by some European countries was misunderstood by Washington, Meloni told reporters during a two-day visit to South Korea. She said the deployment was not a move against the U.S. but aimed to provide security against \"other actors\" that she didn't name.",
      "Jordan Bardella, president of Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally party in France and also a European Parliament lawmaker, posted that the EU should suspend last year's tariff deal with the U.S., describing Mr. Trump's threats as \"commercial blackmail.\"",
      "Mr. Trump also achieved the rare feat of uniting Britain's main political parties \u2014 including the hard-right Reform UK party \u2014 all of whom criticized the tariff threat.",
      "\"We don't always agree with the U.S. government and in this case we certainly don't. These tariffs will hurt us,\" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, a longtime champion and ally of Mr. Trump, wrote on social media. He stopped short of criticizing Mr. Trump's designs on Greenland.",
      "Meanwhile, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who leads the center-left Labour Party, said the tariffs announcement was \"completely wrong\" and his government would \"be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration.\"",

      "Investigative author Peter Schweizer alleges the Mexican government is operating a coordinated influence effort inside the United States.\u00a0 (Solidago/Getty Images\u00a0)",
      "\"Those consular officials have been tied up in organizing political activity in the United States, which is a clear violation of their diplomatic status,\" said Schweizer, investigative journalist and co-founder, alongside former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, of the conservative think tank Government Accountability Institute (GAI).",
      "Schweizer alleged that Mexican consular officials have supported or encouraged anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) protests in the U.S., pointing to what he described as instances in which officials praised or took credit for community mobilization following immigration enforcement actions.",
      "Mexican consulates routinely provide legal assistance and outreach to migrant communities after ICE raids, which Mexican officials characterize as consular protection duties, though critics argue the efforts blur the line between assistance and political activism.",
      "Schweizer also cited the role of Mexico\u2019s so-called \"migrant legislators\" \u2014 elected Mexican officials who reside in the United States and represent Mexicans living abroad \u2014 as evidence of cross-border political engagement. While those officials do not hold U.S. office, some have participated in advocacy events in the United States, raising questions among critics about the scope of foreign political activity on American soil.",

      "STATE DEPARTMENT YANKS VISAS FROM MEXICAN EXECUTIVES IN MIGRANT SMUGGLING CRACKDOWN",
      "\"The Mexican government gives textbooks to school districts in the United States from Los Angeles to Orlando,\" Schweizer said. \"Those textbooks are designed to make sure that migrant children view themselves as Mexican first, not as Mexican\u2013American.\"",
      "Mexican government\u2013produced textbooks are distributed inside the United States through Mexico\u2019s consular network, primarily as donated supplemental materials. The books are published by Mexico\u2019s state textbook authority and are typically made available through consulates, libraries, community centers and, in some cases, schools that request them for Spanish-language or heritage instruction.",

      "Schweizer also alleged coordination between Mexican diplomatic missions and U.S.-based advocacy groups that he said crosses into American electoral politics. He referenced a 2024 meeting held at the Mexican consulate in Oklahoma City that he said included Mexican diplomatic officials and Democratic Party activists.",
      "\"The conversation was about how California had been turned from red to blue, Arizona had been turned from red to blue, and how Republicans were going to \u2018find out\u2019 that they were planning to turn the whole country blue,\" Schweizer said, citing what he described as a transcript of the meeting.",
      "\"That\u2019s not what diplomatic officials should be engaged in,\" he added.",

      "\"We need a zero-tolerance policy,\" he said. \"We\u2019re gearing up for midterm elections, and based on their history, this should not be tolerated.\"",
      "Schweizer also pointed to a Mexican government\u2013backed streaming platform known as Migrant TV, which he said was created to communicate with migrants living in the United States.",
      "\"When you look at the content, it was extremely pro-Kamala Harris and very anti-Trump,\" Schweizer said, adding that the platform has portrayed ICE officials as Nazis and fascists.",
      "The Mexican government launched TV Migrante, a channel dedicated to giving voice to migrants, in March 2025. The channel is available across Mexico and in the U.S. on digital platforms and some cable packages that include international channels.",

      "Schweizer argued that Mexico\u2019s approach should be viewed in a broader geopolitical context, drawing comparisons to China\u2019s use of diplomatic missions and affiliated activist groups in the United States.",
      "\"The question is why are we tolerating this?\" he said. \"I think it\u2019s high time to say enough is enough.\"",

      "U.S. presidents have long enjoyed a wider degree of authority on foreign affairs issues \u2013 including acting unilaterally to order extraterritorial arrests.

      "A 1989 memo authored by then-U.S. Assistant Attorney General Bill Barr has surfaced repeatedly as one of the strongest arguments Trump could cite to justify Maduro's capture. That OLC memo states that \"the president, pursuant to his inherent constitutional authority, can authorize enforcement actions independent of any statutory grant of power.\" It also authorizes FBI agents to effectuate arrests ordered by the president under the \"Take Care\" clause of the U.S. Constitution, and says the authority to order extraterritorial arrests applies even if it impinges \"on the sovereignty of other countries.\"",

According to Apple, the flaws were used in an extremely sophisticated attack that targeted specific individuals. The problem allowed malicious websites to trick iPhones and iPads into running harmful code.

Estimates suggest that about 50 percent of eligible users have not upgraded from iOS 18 to iOS 26. That would leave around 800 million devices vulnerable worldwide.

      "So far, there has been no public notice on Brightspeed's website or social media channels confirming customer data exposure.",
      "Who Brightspeed is and why this matters",
      "Brightspeed is a U.S. telecommunications and internet service provider founded in 2022 after Apollo Global Management acquired local exchange assets from Lumen Technologies.",
      "Headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, the company serves rural and suburban communities across 20 states. It has rapidly expanded its fiber footprint, passing more than 2 million homes and businesses and aiming to reach over 5 million locations.",
      "Because Brightspeed focuses on underserved areas, many customers rely on it as their primary internet provider. That makes any potential breach especially concerning.",

      "That incident later rippled outward. In December, Nissan confirmed that personal data for about 21,000 Japanese customers was exposed through the same breach.",
      "More recently, researchers say Crimson Collective has targeted cloud environments, including Amazon Web Services, by abusing exposed credentials and creating rogue access accounts to escalate privileges.",
      "In other words, the group has a track record that makes its claims hard to ignore.",
      "What this could mean for customers",
      "Even though Brightspeed has not confirmed a breach, the claims alone are enough to raise red flags. If customer data was accessed, it could be used for phishing scams, account takeovers or payment fraud.",

    "summary": "The Rictor X4 electric aircraft promises personal flight for $39,900, making eVTOL technology accessible with 50 mph speeds and truck-bed portability.",
    "story": [
      "A aviation company is turning heads with an electric vertical take-off and landing vehicle.",
      "Personal electric aircraft have teased us for years. They look futuristic, promise freedom from traffic, and usually come with prices that put them out of reach or timelines that feel uncertain. Recently unveiled at CES 2026, the Rictor X4 entered that conversation with some bold claims.",
      "It is a single-passenger electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft designed to make short-range personal flight more accessible and far more affordable. If those promises hold up, it could change how we think about flying for everyday trips.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy Report Get my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter",
      "CES 2026 put health tech front and center, with companies showcasing smarter ways to support prevention, mobility and long-term wellness. (CES)",
      "TECH STARTUP, MAJOR AIRLINE PARTNER TO LAUNCH ELECTRIC AIR TAXI SERVICE",
      "What the Rictor X4 actually is",
      "The Rictor X4 uses a multirotor design with eight propellers spread across four carbon fiber arms. Those arms fold inward when the aircraft is not in use, allowing it to fit in the bed of a pickup truck. The aircraft focuses on low-altitude flight and short hops rather than long journeys.",
      "Key specs include:",
      "Top speed of about 50 mphMaximum flight time of 20 minutesPayload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "Top speed of about 50 mph",
      "Maximum flight time of 20 minutes",
      "Payload capacity of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot",
      "It can lift off and land vertically like a helicopter, then transition into forward flight once airborne. Rictor describes its mission as light aerial mobility, which essentially means short-distance commuting and professional applications.",
      "Inside the X4's propulsion and power system",
      "According to Rictor, the X4's propulsion system is built around stability and redundancy rather than raw speed. Each axis uses a coaxial dual-motor configuration designed to provide consistent thrust during low-altitude flight.",
      "Key propulsion details include:",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axisPeak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axisMaximum continuous power output of 10 kW120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Rated thrust of up to 165 pounds per axis",
      "Peak thrust exceeding 285 pounds per axis",
      "Maximum continuous power output of 10 kW",
      "120-volt operating system designed for outdoor conditions",
      "Together, these systems aim to deliver controlled, predictable flight with built-in safety margins, especially during takeoff, landing and hover.",
      "The Rictor X4 is a single-passenger electric aircraft designed for short-range, low-altitude flight with a folding multirotor layout. (Rictor)",
      "Safety systems and flight control in the Rictor X4",
      "Rictor puts safety at the center of the X4's design. The aircraft uses a semi-solid state battery system with dual battery redundancy, which helps enable a controlled landing if one battery module fails. In addition, an emergency parachute system provides backup protection during critical situations. At the same time, a centralized flight control system actively manages propulsion, attitude and overall system health. This system continuously monitors key flight data to help maintain stability in changing conditions.",
      "Beyond software, the hardware plays an important role. The X4 features 63-inch carbon fiber folding propellers in a 4-axis, 8-propeller configuration. Together, they support a payload of up to 220 pounds, including the pilot. According to Rictor, the aircraft is designed to operate at noise levels below 65 decibels, although independent testing has not yet been published. Finally, Rictor's proprietary Dynamic Balance Algorithm adjusts the output of all eight motors in real time. As a result, the X4 can maintain a stable hover even in side winds rated up to Level 6.",
      "The FAA rule that could make personal flight easier",
      "One of Rictor's most attention-grabbing claims involves regulation. The company says the X4 is designed to comply with FAA Part 103, which governs ultralight vehicles in the U.S. If operated within Part 103 limits, the X4 could be flown legally without airworthiness certification or a pilot's license. Rictor says this is enabled by autonomous pre-programmed flight paths and very low altitude operation, reportedly as low as three meters above ground. It is worth noting that Part 103 still carries operational restrictions, including where and how flight can occur. Final compliance depends on real-world use and FAA interpretation.",
      "Designed to fold, transport, and recharge",
      "Portability is a major focus. Rictor says the X4 folds down to about 42 cubic feet, which makes it compact enough to transport in the bed of a pickup truck. The company also highlights in-vehicle charging support while parked or on the move, positioning the X4 as something that can be transported and recharged alongside ground vehicles rather than stored at an airfield.",
      "AIR TAXI SERVICE PLANS EVTOL RIDES FROM ALL THREE NYC AIRPORTS",
      "The price that resets expectations",
      "The Rictor X4 carries a launch price of $39,900 with a $5,000 deposit. That alone separates it from most personal eVTOLs currently discussed in the market. The aircraft is produced by Kuickwheel Technology, Rictor's parent company. According to the company, first customer deliveries are scheduled for Q2 2026. As with any aircraft launch, timelines remain aspirational until production units reach customers.",
      "Why this matters now",
      "Personal eVTOLs have lived in a narrow space between concept and reality. High costs, regulatory hurdles and safety concerns have slowed adoption. If Rictor delivers an aircraft that performs as described while operating within ultralight rules, it could expand personal flight beyond niche enthusiasts and into practical short-range use. Now it comes down to whether the company can deliver on what it's promising.",
      "Take my quiz: How safe is your online security?",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The Rictor X4 brings together aggressive pricing, compact design and regulatory positioning in a way we have not seen before. Folding propellers, redundant safety systems and Part 103 alignment make it one of the most ambitious personal eVTOL launches to date. The unanswered questions center on real-world performance, regulatory interpretation and production readiness. Until aircraft are flying outside controlled demonstrations, healthy skepticism remains warranted. Still, this is one of the most compelling personal flight announcements to come out of CES in recent years.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "A new malware campaign is turning WhatsApp Web into a weapon. Security researchers say a banking Trojan linked to Astaroth is now spreading automatically through chat messages, making the attack harder to stop once it starts.",
      "The campaign is known as Boto Cor-de-Rosa. It shows how cybercriminals keep evolving, especially when they can abuse tools people trust every day. This attack focuses on Windows users and uses WhatsApp Web as both the delivery system and the engine that spreads the infection further.",

      "BROWSER EXTENSION MALWARE INFECTED 8.8M USERS IN DARKSPECTRE ATTACK",
      "Attackers abuse the WhatsApp Web to spread malware through messages that appear to come from people you trust. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How this WhatsApp Web attack works",
      "The attack starts with a simple message. A contact sends what looks like a routine ZIP file through WhatsApp. The file name appears random and harmless, which lowers suspicion. Once opened, the ZIP contains a Visual Basic script disguised as a normal document. If the user runs it, the script quietly pulls in two more pieces of malware. Then the script downloads the Astaroth banking malware written in Delphi. It also installs a Python-based module designed to control WhatsApp Web. Both components run in the background without obvious warning signs. From there, the infection becomes self-sustaining.",
      "Malware that spreads itself through your contacts",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is how it propagates. The Python module scans the victim's WhatsApp contacts and sends the malicious ZIP file to every conversation automatically. Researchers at Acronis found that the malware adapts its messages based on the time of day. It sends friendly greetings, making the message feel normal and familiar. The text says, \"Here is the requested file. If you have any questions, I'm available!\" Because the message appears to come from someone you know, many people open it without hesitation.",
      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "A single ZIP file sent through chat can quietly install banking malware and begin spreading to every contact. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Built-in tracking keeps the attack efficient",
      "This malware is carefully designed to monitor its own performance in real time. The propagation tool tracks how many messages are successfully delivered, how many fail to send and the overall sending speed measured per minute. After every 50 messages, it generates progress updates that show how many contacts have been reached. This feedback allows attackers to measure success quickly and make adjustments if something stops working.",
      "What happens after infection?",
      "The initial script is heavily obfuscated to avoid detection by antivirus tools. Once it runs, it launches PowerShell commands that download more malware from compromised websites. One known domain used in this campaign is coffe-estilo.com. The malware installs itself inside a folder that mimics a Microsoft Edge cache directory. Inside are executable files and libraries that make up the full Astaroth banking payload. From there, the malware can steal credentials, monitor activity and potentially access financial accounts.",
      "Why WhatsApp Web is being abused",
      "WhatsApp Web is popular because it mirrors your phone conversations on a computer. That convenience makes it easy to send messages, share files and type faster, but it also introduces risk. When you use WhatsApp Web, you link your phone to a browser by scanning a QR code at web.whatsapp.com. Once connected, that browser session becomes a trusted extension of your account. Your chats appear on the screen, messages you send come from your real number and incoming messages sync across both devices.",
      "That setup is exactly what attackers take advantage of. If malware gains access to a computer with WhatsApp Web logged in, it can act as the user. It can read messages, access contact lists and send files or links that look completely legitimate. The messages do not raise alarms because they are coming from a real account, not a fake one.",
      "This is what turns WhatsApp Web into an effective delivery system for malware. Instead of breaking into WhatsApp itself, attackers simply abuse an open browser session to spread malicious files automatically.",
      "Many users do not realize the danger because WhatsApp Web feels harmless. It is often left signed in on work computers, shared devices or systems without strong security. In those situations, malware does not need advanced tricks. It only needs access to an already trusted session. That combination of convenience and trust is why WhatsApp Web has become such an attractive target.",

      "Once the WhatsApp Web is compromised, malware can act like the user, sending messages and files that look completely legitimate.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How to stay safe from WhatsApp Web malware",
      "Attacks like this WhatsApp Web malware are designed to spread fast through trusted conversations. A few smart habits can dramatically lower your risk.",
      "Messaging apps feel casual, which is exactly why attackers use them. Never open ZIP files sent through chat unless you confirm with the sender first. Watch for file names made of random numbers or unfamiliar names.\u00a0Treat messages that create urgency or feel overly familiar as a warning sign. If a file arrives out of nowhere, pause before clicking.",
      "This campaign abuses WhatsApp Web to spread automatically once a device is infected. Check active WhatsApp Web sessions and log out of any you do not recognize. Avoid leaving WhatsApp Web signed in on shared or public computers. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) inside WhatsApp settings. Cutting off Web access helps limit how far malware can travel.",
      "This type of malware takes advantage of systems that fall behind on updates. Install Windows updates as soon as they are available. Also, keep your web browser fully updated. Staying current closes many of the doors attackers try to slip through. In addition, use strong antivirus software that watches for script abuse and PowerShell activity in real time.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2026 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Banking malware often pairs with identity theft and financial fraud. One way to reduce the fallout is by shrinking your digital footprint. A data removal service can help remove your personal information from data broker sites that attackers often search. With less information available, criminals have fewer details to exploit if malware reaches your device.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "Even with strong security habits, financial monitoring adds another layer of protection. An identity theft protection service can watch for suspicious activity tied to your credit and personal data. Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number, phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",
      "You should also turn on alerts for bank and credit card transactions so you are notified quickly if something looks wrong. The less exposed your data is, the fewer opportunities attackers have to cause damage.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Most malware infections happen because people act too quickly. If a message feels off, trust that instinct. Familiar names and friendly language can lower your guard, but they should never replace caution. Take a moment to verify the message or file before opening anything. Attackers rely on trust and urgency to succeed. Slowing down takes away their advantage.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This WhatsApp Web malware campaign is a reminder that cyberattacks no longer rely on obvious red flags. Instead, they blend into everyday conversations and use familiar tools to spread quietly and quickly. What makes this threat especially concerning is how little effort it takes for it to move from one device to dozens of others.",
      "A single click can turn a trusted chat into a delivery system for banking malware and identity theft. The good news is that small changes make a big difference. Paying attention to attachments, locking down WhatsApp Web access, keeping devices updated and slowing down before clicking can stop these attacks cold. As messaging platforms continue to play a bigger role in daily life, staying alert is no longer optional. Awareness and simple habits remain some of the strongest defenses you have.",

      "Instead of finger pricks, the device analyzes acetone and other compounds in exhaled breath linked to blood sugar levels. (PreEvnt)",
      "How the PreEvnt isaac monitors glucose using breath",
      "One of the most talked-about health devices at CES 2026 came from PreEvnt. Its product, called isaac, takes a nontraditional approach to glucose awareness. Instead of piercing skin or using optical sensors, isaac analyzes your breath.",
      "The device measures volatile organic compounds, especially acetone, which has long been associated with rising blood glucose. That sweet fruity breath is a known marker of diabetes. By detecting changes in those compounds, isaac can alert users to potential glucose events. The device is small, about the size of a quarter, with a loop so it can be worn on a lanyard or clipped to clothing or a bag.",
      "The breath-based design is intended to reduce how often users need finger-prick blood tests, while providing early alerts for glucose-related changes.",
      "The device is named after the inventor's grandson, Isaac, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at just 2 years old. The inventor, Bud Wilcox, wanted to reduce the number of painful finger pricks his grandson faced each day. That personal motivation led to years of collaboration with scientists, designers and engineers. Research and development included work with Indiana University under the direction of Dr. M. Agarwal. The goal was simple but ambitious: Alert families to blood sugar events earlier while reducing the physical and emotional toll of constant testing.",
      "How the isaac device fits into daily life",
      "Isaac is designed to fit into everyday routines. Users breathe into the device, which processes the reading and sends the data to a companion smartphone app. The app, still in its final stages of development, focuses on awareness and safety. Current features include:",

A single charge lasts all day and supports multiple breath tests. The device comes with a USB-C charging cradle and cable.",

      "Designed for everyday use, the isaac wearable device pairs with a smartphone app to log readings and send alerts when needed. (PreEvnt)",
      "Clinical trials and FDA review for the isaac device",
      "PreEvnt first introduced isaac publicly at CES 2025. Later that year, the device entered active human clinical trials.\u00a0Those studies compare isaac's breath-based alerts with traditional blood glucose monitoring methods.",
      "Trials began with adolescents who have Type 1 diabetes and later expanded to adults with Type 2 diabetes. The company is now working toward regulatory review with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Because this technology is new, PreEvnt is pursuing a de novo pathway, which allows devices to be evaluated while standards are still being defined. According to the company, regulators have shown strong interest as the data continues to come in.",
      "Isaac does not claim to replace medical-grade glucose meters. The device is being developed to supplement existing monitoring methods by offering breath-based alerts tied to glucose-related changes.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Noninvasive glucose monitoring has long felt like a future promise that never quite arrives. The attention around isaac at CES 2026 suggests that promise may finally be getting closer. If clinical trials continue to deliver strong results and regulators give approval, breathing into a small device could one day replace at least some finger pricks.

      "\"Your Medicare information has to be updated\"",

      "Do it yourself:",
      "You can visit individual data broker websites, search for your profile and submit opt-out requests.This method works, but it takes time. Each site has its own rules, identity verification steps, and response timelines. Many brokers also re-add data later, which means you have to repeat the process regularly.",
      "Use a data removal service:",

      "If you receive a warning about an account problem, do not trust the message itself. Open the official app or website, and check there. If something is wrong, you will see it immediately. If not, you just avoided a scam.",
      "Enable login alerts and security notifications on important accounts. These alerts can warn you if someone tries to sign in from a new device or location. Early warnings give you time to act before real damage occurs.",
      "Reusing passwords makes it easy for scammers to take over multiple accounts at once. If one service is compromised, attackers try the same login on email, banking, and social media accounts.

    "story": [
      "Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson spoke with Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, about how attitudes toward autonomous trucks have shifted over time.",
      "Kodiak AI, a leading provider of AI-powered autonomous driving technology, has spent years quietly proving that self-driving trucks can work in the real world. The company's core system, the Kodiak Driver, brings software and hardware together in a practical way. As the company explains, \"The Kodiak Driver combines advanced AI-driven software with modular, vehicle-agnostic hardware into a single, unified platform.\"",
      "That approach matters because trucking is not a closed lab environment. It is highways, weather, fatigue and long hours. Kodiak's strategy focuses on solving those realities first.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2013 free when you join my CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "How public views on autonomous trucks are changing",
      "During a recent episode of CyberGuy's \"Beyond Connected\" podcast, Kurt spoke with Daniel Goff, vice president of external affairs at Kodiak AI, about how attitudes toward autonomous trucks have shifted over time.",
      "WILL AUTONOMOUS TRUCKS REPLACE DRIVERS BY 2027?",
      "Autonomous trucks are already hauling freight on public highways as companies test how the technology performs in real-world conditions. (Kodiak)",
      "Goff described how different the reaction was when the company first launched. \"Kodiak was founded in 2018, and I joined in 2019. When I first started at the company, I said I worked for a company that was working to build trucks that drive themselves, and people kind of looked at me like I was crazy. Over the last few years, we've really seen autonomous vehicles capture the public's imagination. We've seen them grow in the real world. I think that people are getting more used to this idea.\"",
      "For Goff, that shift has come from seeing the technology operate safely outside of test environments, where performance matters more than hype.",
      "Why autonomous trucks could improve road safety",
      "One of Kodiak AI's central arguments is simple. Machines avoid many of the risks that come with human driving. \"We think there are advantages to this technology that humans, myself included, can't match. You know this technology doesn't get distracted. It doesn't check its phone. It doesn't have a phone. It doesn't have a bad day to take it out on the road. It doesn't speed. It doesn't know how to speed. You know they're pretty boring drivers.\" In trucking, boring is often a good thing.",
      "Where autonomous trucks are already operating today",
      "Kodiak AI is already doing this on real roads. The company has been running active freight routes for years, not just testing in controlled settings. \"Kodiak's headquarters are in Mountainview, California, but since 2019, we've had a command center in Lancaster, Texas, which is just south of Dallas. Since 2019, we've actually been delivering freight from that Lancaster hub to Houston, Oklahoma City and Atlanta with what we call a safety driver behind the wheel.\"",
      "Those real-world miles have helped Kodiak fine-tune its system in everyday traffic, weather and long-haul conditions.",
      "Tractor trailers at the entrance of the Port of Baltimore in Maryland on Oct. 8, 2024. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)",
      "The trucking problem Kodiak is trying to solve",
      "Long-haul trucking is essential to the U.S. economy, but it is also one of the most demanding and risky jobs on the road. Drivers spend long stretches away from home, work extended hours and operate heavy vehicles in all conditions. As Goff put it, \"Driving a truck is one of the most difficult and dangerous jobs that people do in the United States every day. You know, being a truck driver means, for at least a long-haul truck driver, means you're away from your family for sometimes days, weeks, even months at a time, sleeping in the back of the truck.\"",
      "He also pointed to federal safety rules that limit how long drivers can stay behind the wheel, which are meant to reduce fatigue but also restrict how much freight one person can move in a day. \"If you're driving the 11-hour legal maximum per day and there are people who love being long-haul truckers, but we\u2019re not seeing people stepping up for those roles anymore in this country, and drivers are retiring every year.\"",
      "Those realities have contributed to ongoing driver shortages and growing pressure on the freight system. Kodiak believes autonomous technology is best used where the job is hardest and most repetitive. \"The goal for this technology is really best suited for those really tough jobs. The long lonely highway miles, the trucking and remote locations where people either don't wanna live or don't or can't easily live.\"",
      "Goff also highlighted how much capacity is lost simply because trucks sit idle for most of the day. \"The average truck is driven about seven hours a day in the U.S., and you know there are 24 hours a day, so that's a lot of time just sitting there.\"",
      "Autonomy, he said, could help change that math. \"The goal of the technology is that you can basically run 24/7, just kind of stopping to refuel, to inspect the truck for safety, and you know, other than that, the trucks are moving.\"",
      "Long-haul trucking is one of the most demanding jobs on the road, which is why autonomous systems focus on long, repetitive highway routes. (Kodiak)",
      "How many miles Kodiak AI has driven to prove safety",
      "Kodiak AI emphasizes data over promises. \"We've driven over 3 million miles with a safety driver behind the wheel for most of those miles, meaning somebody ready to take over at any time. So, we got a very good track record.\" To put that into perspective, Goff added, \"The average American drives about 800,000 miles in their lifetime, which seems crazy. That's a lot of driving, but we're at almost four average lifetimes with our system today, and we also use computer simulation, all sorts of things to assess the safety of the system.\"",
      "In addition to its long-haul operations, Kodiak AI works with Atlas Energy Solutions, which does oil logistics in the Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico. As of Q3 2025, the company has delivered 10 driverless trucks to Atlas, which autonomously deliver sand up to 24 hours a day with no human operator in the cab. Goff says, \"We see our work in the Permian as a perfect sandbox for our long-haul operations.\"",
      "The company has also sought third-party validation. \"Additionally, we have done external-facing studies. We did a study with a company called Nauto, which is one of the leaders in AI-enabled dashcams. They actually help vehicle fleets compute safety scores from an outside perspective. Our system scored the highest ever in the Nauto safety score.\"",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Where autonomous truck regulations stand today",
      "Policy is another key factor in adoption. \"From a regulatory perspective. 25 states have passed laws allowing autonomous vehicle deployment.\" Goff believes the danger of everyday driving makes the case clear. \"I think people who think about transportation every day understand how dangerous driving a car is, driving a truck is, and just being on the road see the potential for this technology.\"",
      "What critics say about autonomous trucks",
      "Autonomous trucking still raises concerns among safety advocates and everyday drivers. Critics question whether software can respond fast enough in emergencies, handle unpredictable human behavior or make judgment calls during complex highway situations.",
      "Kodiak AI says those concerns are exactly why safety comes first. As Goff explained, \"In this industry in particular, we really understand how important it is to be safe.\"",
      "The company argues that autonomous systems must earn trust over time through real-world performance, transparent testing and measurable results, not promises or hype.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday drivers, autonomous trucks raise understandable questions. Sharing the road with a vehicle controlled by software can feel unsettling, especially when headlines often focus on what could go wrong. Kodiak's argument is that safety improves when fatigue, distraction and emotional decision-making are removed from long highway driving. If the technology continues to perform as claimed, the impact could show up in quieter ways. That includes fewer tired drivers on overnight routes, more predictable freight movement and potentially safer highways over time. For consumers, it could also mean fewer delivery delays and less strain on a trucking system already short on drivers.",

      "Safety data, real-world miles and third-party reviews now play a central role in building trust in self-driving trucks. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking is not a future concept anymore. Kodiak AI is already moving freight and collecting real safety data on public roads. At the same time, skepticism remains healthy and necessary. Trust in this technology will rise or fall based on transparency, regulation and long-term performance, not promises. The real question is no longer whether self-driving trucks can operate. It is whether they can consistently prove they make roads safer for everyone who shares them.",

      "Unexpected Instagram password reset emails can look completely legitimate, which is why so many users are caught off guard during this surge. (Cyverguy.com)",
      "Why Instagram password reset emails are surging",
      "This surge is happening because the reset emails themselves can be real, even when the intent behind them is not. Instead of building fake phishing pages or using malware, attackers take advantage of Instagram's normal account recovery system.",
      "The process is simple. An attacker enters your username or email into Instagram's real password reset form. Instagram automatically sends a legitimate reset email to you. The attacker then waits to see how you react.",
      "At this point, your account has not been hacked. The risk comes from what happens next. Attackers are counting on common mistakes, such as clicking the reset button and rushing through the process, reusing a weak password, getting redirected to a fake follow-up page or falling for a second scam email that arrives soon after.",
      "That is why this tactic works as a stress test. It creates urgency and pressure, even though nothing has been compromised yet.",
      "Why attackers love this tactic",
      "This is classic social engineering. The attacker does not need to outsmart Instagram. They need to outsmart you in a stressed moment. A reset email creates urgency. It also feels official. That combination leads people to click first and think second, which is exactly the outcome attackers want. You can treat these surprise reset emails as an early warning system. If you get one:",

      "If an email pressures you to act immediately, threatens account deletion or asks for extra information, treat it as suspicious.",
      "The BreachForums leak connection",
      "The timing of this surge has raised fresh concerns. Reports point to data tied to roughly 17.5 million Instagram accounts being shared on BreachForums, an underground forum where cybercriminals trade and discuss stolen data. The alleged post appeared in early January 2026, which lines up with when many users began reporting a sudden wave of password reset emails, sometimes receiving several in a short period of time.",
      "This timing alone does not prove a direct connection. However, leaked usernames or email addresses can make it much easier for attackers to target large numbers of accounts at once, which is exactly what this kind of reset spam depends on. We reached out to Meta for comment but did not receive a response before our deadline.",
      "We reached out to Meta for comment, and a spokesperson for the company told CyberGuy, \"We fixed an issue that allowed an external party to request password reset emails for some Instagram users. We want to reassure everyone there was no breach of our systems and people's Instagram accounts remain secure. People can disregard these emails and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused.\"",
      "How to tell if the reset email is legitimate",
      "A legitimate Instagram reset email can still be part of an attack attempt. So your goal is not \"confirm it is real,\" it is \"avoid reacting in a risky way.\" Instagram's own guidance boils down to this:",
      "A reset email alone does not mean your account is compromisedIf you did not request it, do not use the linkUse Instagram's official paths in the app to review security and report suspicious messages",
      "A reset email alone does not mean your account is compromised",

      "Use Instagram's official paths in the app to review security and report suspicious messages",
      "Also, if you get emails about changing your account email address, Instagram says those messages can include a way to reverse the change, which can help you recover if someone broke in.",
      "These real-looking messages are designed to create urgency and push people to click before slowing down and checking their account security. (Cyverguy.com)",

    "published": "Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:21:21 -0500",
    "summary": "FCC imposes new $10,000 fines on telecom companies for false robocall filings. New penalties take effect Feb. 5 to strengthen enforcement against violations.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "If you are tired of scam calls slipping through the cracks, federal regulators just took a meaningful step. The Federal Communications Commission finalized new penalties aimed at telecom companies that submit false, inaccurate or late information to a key anti-robocall system. The changes go into effect Feb. 5. They strengthen oversight of the Robocall Mitigation Database, which plays a central role in tracking spoofed calls and holding providers accountable.",

      "What changed and why it matters",
      "Under the new rules, voice service providers must recertify every year that their filings in the Robocall Mitigation Database are accurate and current. The FCC will now back that requirement with real financial consequences.",
      "The FCC is cracking down on robocalls by tightening rules that govern how telecom providers verify and report call traffic. (iStock)",
      "FCC SCRUBS OWN REFERENCE TO 'INDEPENDENT' AGENCY FROM WEBSITE AFTER DEM'S TESTY EXCHANGE WITH CHAIRMAN",
      "Here is what the commission approved:",
      "$10,000 fines for submitting false or inaccurate information$1,000 fines for each database entry not updated within 10 business daysAnnual recertification of all provider filingsThe FCC also adopted a $100 filing fee for initial Robocall Mitigation Database submissions and for required annual recertifications.Two-factor authentication to protect database accessA $100 application fee for initial filings and annual recertifications",
      "$10,000 fines for submitting false or inaccurate information",
      "$1,000 fines for each database entry not updated within 10 business days",
      "Annual recertification of all provider filings",
      "The FCC also adopted a $100 filing fee for initial Robocall Mitigation Database submissions and for required annual recertifications.",
      "Two-factor authentication to protect database access",
      "A $100 application fee for initial filings and annual recertifications",
      "The FCC also made clear that these violations are considered ongoing until corrected, meaning fines can accrue on a daily basis rather than being treated as one-time penalties.",
      "According to the FCC, many past submissions failed basic standards. Some lacked accurate contact details. Others included robocall mitigation plans that did not describe any real mitigation practices at all.",
      "How the Robocall Mitigation Database works",
      "The Robocall Mitigation Database requires providers to verify and certify the identities of callers that use their networks. Regulators and law enforcement rely on it to trace spoofed calls and illegal robocall campaigns. That task is harder than it sounds. America's telecom system is vast and fragmented. Calls often pass through multiple networks owned by major carriers like Verizon and AT&T, as well as smaller regional providers and VoIP services. When calls hop between networks, verification can be missed or ignored. For years, the FCC did not closely verify or enforce the accuracy of these filings. That gap raised serious concerns.",
      "Under the updated rules, providers that fail to recertify or correct deficient filings can be referred to enforcement and removed from the database, which can prevent other carriers from carrying their calls at all.",
      "Why inaccurate robocall data hurts consumers",
      "When robocall filings are wrong or outdated, scam calls are more likely to reach your phone. Providers may treat a call as trusted even when it should raise red flags. That gives robocallers more time to operate and makes it harder for regulators to shut them down quickly. The FCC says stronger penalties and tighter oversight are meant to close that gap before consumers pay the price.",
      "New FCC penalties target inaccurate robocall filings that have allowed scam calls to slip through carrier networks.\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Pushback and pressure on the FCC",
      "When the FCC proposed penalties, it asked whether violations should be treated as minor paperwork mistakes or as serious misrepresentations. Telecom trade groups pushed back. They argued that fines should not apply unless providers first get a chance to fix errors or unless the FCC proves the filings were willfully inaccurate.",
      "State attorneys general and the robocall monitoring platform ZipDX urged a tougher stance. They warned that false filings undermine every effort to stop illegal robocalls. The FCC ultimately chose a middle path. It rejected treating violations as harmless paperwork errors. At the same time, it stopped short of imposing the maximum penalties allowed by law.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For everyday consumers, this move matters more than it may seem. Accurate robocall reporting makes it easier to trace scam calls, shut down bad actors and prevent spoofed numbers from reaching your phone. Stronger penalties give telecoms a reason to take these filings seriously instead of treating them as routine compliance chores.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "The FCC also set a firm annual deadline. Providers must recertify their robocall mitigation filings each year by March 1, creating a predictable enforcement checkpoint. While this will not end robocalls overnight, it tightens a weak link that scammers have exploited for years.",
      "Simple steps you can take right now to reduce robocalls",
      "Even with tougher FCC enforcement, scam calls will not disappear overnight. Here are a few smart steps you can take today to reduce your risk.",
      "Do not answer unknown calls. If it is important, a legitimate caller will leave a voicemail.Never press buttons or say yes to robocall prompts. That confirms your number is active and can trigger more scam calls.Report scam calls to your carrier. Most major carriers let you report robocalls directly through their call log or app.Register your number with the National Do Not Call Registry at donotcall.gov/. It will not stop scammers, but it can reduce legitimate telemarketing calls.Block repeat offenders. If the same number keeps calling, block it so your phone stops ringing altogether.Be cautious with callback numbers. Scammers often spoof local area codes to look familiar.",

      "The FCC says accurate robocall reporting by telecoms helps carriers identify and shut down scam traffic faster, but consumer habits still matter.",
      "Pro tip: remove your personal data at the source",
      "Robocalls do not come out of nowhere. Many start with your personal information being sold or shared by data brokers. These companies collect phone numbers, addresses, emails and even family details from public records, apps, purchases and online activity. Scammers and shady marketers buy that data to build call lists. Removing your data from data broker sites can reduce the number of robocalls you receive over time. You can try to do this manually by finding individual data broker websites and submitting removal requests one by one. The process is time-consuming and often needs to be repeated.",
      "Some people choose to use a data removal service to automate this process and continuously monitor for re-posting. That can help limit how often your phone number circulates among marketers and scammers. Less exposed data means fewer opportunities for robocallers to target you. Cutting off robocalls often starts long before your phone rings.",

      "By strengthening oversight and accountability, the FCC aims to shut down illegal robocalls before they ever reach your phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Robocalls thrive when accountability breaks down. By adding meaningful fines, stronger security, annual recertification and filing fees, the FCC is signaling that accuracy is no longer optional. Because penalties can continue to build until problems are fixed, telecoms now face real consequences for ignoring or delaying corrections. This rule forces providers to own their role in stopping illegal calls instead of passing the blame along the network chain. Real progress will depend on enforcement, but this is one of the clearest signs yet that regulators are closing gaps scammers rely on.",

    "story": [
      "Kurt the CyberGuy joins 'Fox & Friends' to share his tips to stay safe from online scammers and recent warnings on how AI toys can harm children.",
      "Mac users often assume they're safer than everyone else, especially when they stick to official app stores and trusted tools.",
      "That sense of security is exactly what attackers like to exploit. Security researchers have now uncovered a fresh wave of malicious Mac extensions that don't just spy on you, but can also steal cryptocurrency wallet data, passwords and even Keychain credentials. What makes this campaign especially concerning is where the malware was found, inside legitimate extension marketplaces that many people trust by default.",

      "Once active, GlassWorm targets passwords, crypto wallets, and even your macOS Keychain without obvious warning signs. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "How malicious Mac extensions slipped into trusted stores",
      "Security researchers at Koi Security uncovered a new wave of the GlassWorm malware hiding inside extensions for code editors like Visual Studio Code (via Bleeping Computer). If you're not familiar with code editors, they're tools developers use to write and edit code, similar to how you might use Google Docs or Microsoft Word to edit text. These malicious extensions appeared on both the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace and OpenVSX, platforms widely used by developers and power users.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "At first glance, the extensions looked harmless. They promised popular features like code formatting, themes or productivity tools. Once installed, though, they quietly ran malicious code in the background. Earlier versions of GlassWorm relied on hidden text tricks to stay invisible. The latest wave goes further by encrypting its malicious code and delaying execution, making it harder for automated security checks to catch.",
      "Even though this campaign is described as targeting developers, you don't need to write code to be at risk. If you use a Mac, install extensions or store passwords or cryptocurrency on your system, this threat still applies to you.",
      "What GlassWorm does once it's on your Mac",
      "Once active, GlassWorm goes after some of the most sensitive data on your device. It attempts to steal login credentials tied to platforms like GitHub and npm, but it doesn't stop there. The malware also targets browser-based cryptocurrency wallets and now tries to access your macOS Keychain, where many saved passwords are stored.",
      "Researchers also found that GlassWorm checks whether hardware wallet apps like Ledger Live or Trezor Suite are installed. If they are, the malware attempts to replace them with a compromised version designed to steal crypto. That part of the attack isn't fully working yet, but the functionality is already in place.",
      "To maintain access, the malware sets itself up to run automatically after a reboot. It can also allow remote access to your system and route internet traffic through your Mac without you realizing it, turning your device into a quiet relay for someone else.",
      "Some of the malicious extensions showed tens of thousands of downloads. Those numbers can be manipulated, but they still create a false sense of trust that makes people more likely to install them.",
      "7 steps you can take to stay safe from malicious Mac extensions",
      "Malicious extensions don't look dangerous. That's what makes them effective. These steps can help you reduce the risk, even when threats slip into trusted marketplaces.",
      "Every extension you install increases risk. If you're not actively using one, remove it. Be especially cautious of extensions that promise big productivity gains, premium features for free or imitate popular tools with slightly altered names.",
      "Check who made the extension. Established developers usually have a clear website, documentation and update history. New publishers, vague descriptions or cloned names should raise red flags.",
      "These malicious extensions looked like helpful tools but quietly ran hidden code once installed. (Cyberguy.com)",
      "A password manager keeps your logins encrypted and stored safely outside your browser or editor. It also ensures every account has a unique password, so if one set of credentials is stolen, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "HOW HACKERS ARE BREAKING INTO APPLE DEVICES THROUGH AIRPLAY",
      "Modern macOS malware doesn't always drop obvious files. Antivirus tools today focus on behavior, looking for suspicious background activity, encrypted payloads and persistence mechanisms used by malicious extensions. This adds a critical safety net when something slips through official marketplaces.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "When your data leaks, it often spreads across data broker sites and breaches databases. Personal data removal services help reduce how much of your information is publicly available, making it harder for attackers to target you with follow-up scams or account takeovers.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Enable 2FA wherever possible, especially for email, cloud services, developer platforms and crypto-related accounts. Even if a password is stolen, 2FA can stop attackers from logging in.",
      "Security updates close gaps that malware relies on. Turn on automatic updates so you're protected even if you miss the headlines or forget to check manually.",
      "Mac users often trust official app stores, but that trust is exactly what attackers are counting on. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "GlassWorm shows that malware doesn't always come from shady downloads or obvious scams. Sometimes it hides inside tools you already trust. Even official extension stores can host malicious software long enough to cause real harm. If you use a Mac and rely on extensions, a quick review of what's installed could save you from losing passwords, crypto or access to important accounts.",

      "Criminal defense attorney and Fox News contributor Donna Rotunno weighs in on what she calls a frivolous motion from accused Charlie Kirk assassin Tyler Robinson's defense team.",
      "Legal analysts are urging the Utah judge overseeing the case against a 22-year-old electrician accused of assassinating Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk to firmly reject what they see as a \"frivolous\" defense motion delaying the proceedings.",
      "Tyler Robinson has not yet entered a plea or faced a preliminary hearing \u2014 a crucial early step in Utah's legal process where prosecutors have to convince the judge they have probable cause to bring charges. That has to take place, unless the defense waives it, before he can be arraigned.",
      "Judge Tony Graf Jr., a former prosecutor, was appointed to Utah's Fourth District Court in May 2025 and is now presiding over one of the highest-profile court cases in the country. While he's taken a balanced approach so far, legal analysts tell Fox News Digital he could be stricter in clamping down on what they see as \"frivolous\" motions and delay tactics by the defense.",
      "\"The judge has let it go on too far,\" said Donna Rotunno, a Chicago-based criminal defense attorney and Fox News contributor. \"This is something that the judge could've looked at in writing and said, 'You know what? No need for a hearing.'\"",

      "While Argentina\u2019s Peronist government sympathized and often knew of Nazi criminals hiding in their territory \u2013 often under their auspices \u2013 once the populist regime fell, the South American nation half-heartedly tried to keep tabs on the war criminals hiding there.",

      "Hitler with Martin Bormann, right, and Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in August 1943. (Ullstein Bild/Ullstein Bild via Getty Images)",
      "Bormann was one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi regime, despite his relatively low profile to the public. He used his position as private secretary to Hitler and head of the Nazi Party Chancellery to control the flow of documents personally received by Hitler and who had access to him.",
      "Through enormous administrative influence, he shaped policy and controlled what Hitler saw, who he met, and advised on major decisions. Bormann supported extreme antisemitic measures and was one of the masterminds of the Aryanization project. Bormann disappeared in May 1945 during the fall of Berlin. For decades, it was speculated he had fled to Argentina along the ratlines \u2014 escape routes facilitated by Nazi sympathizers. Bormann was sentenced to death in absentia during the Nuremberg Trials.",
      "The files show that Bormann was one of the very few Nazis the Argentinians actively tried to pursue and bring to justice. However, most of the leads came from sensationalist press articles often devoid of factual and actionable intelligence beyond the mere mention that he was hiding in Argentina.",
      "The files meticulously depict intelligence agencies trying to corroborate such reports and assert whether the floated false aliases matched the actual man in Argentina. Agencies followed information coming from reports in the Argentine, U.S., British and Brazilian press, along with some translations from German-language media published in Argentina by the \u00e9migr\u00e9 community who were suspected of harboring Nazi sympathizers.",
      "The articles triggered extensive paper trails between the ministry of justice, intelligence bodies, border and customs agencies, the federal police, and local authorities, but were often disconnected from one another, or took a long time to be referred to the various sub-offices for action.",

      "As a result, multiple similar searches were carried out at various points haphazardly and a tangle of bureaucracy made authorities play catch up to press reports rather than conduct independent and rational investigations. The files are a testament that the hunt for Nazis in South America was shaped by rumor, miscommunication, mistaken identities, Cold War politics and intense media speculation.",
      "Some of the information reviewed by Fox News Digital showed authorities took rumors such as a hunt for Bormann in the jungles of Peru, Colombia and Brazil as credible. A case of an elderly German man detained in Colombia in 1972 as Bormann (later cleared and released) despite voiced skepticism by Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal is also part of the files.",

      "The diplomatic shockwaves that followed Israel\u2019s Mossad seizing Adolf Eichmann in Argentina left local officials acutely sensitive to international scrutiny, recasting the search for Bormann as a bid to ensure the country would not be embarrassed on the world stage a second time.",
      "A pivotal\u2014and ultimately flawed\u2014lead in the Bormann files emerged in 1955, when police, relying on fading testimonies about an illegal German laborer, along with rumors, seized correspondence and aging witnesses, began pursuing a man named Walter Wilhelm Flegel.",

Suspicions led to his arrest in Mendoza in 1960 despite his complete dissemblance, lack of education, long presence in the country, age gaps and missing factual connections that could tie him to Bormann. Notwithstanding such mismatching profiles \u2014 and fingerprints \u2014 it still took a week for Argentinians to be convinced Flegel was not Bormann and free him.",

Later, in the 1990s, further DNA testing confirmed the remains found in Berlin indeed belonged to Bormann, bringing the misdirected Argentinian search finally to a close.",

      "Just one year into his second term, President Donald Trump has pardoned an unusually high number of wealthy people accused of financial crimes, according to an NBC News analysis of the last four administrations.",
      "Over half of Trump\u2019s 88 individual pardons are for white-collar offenses, with money laundering, bank fraud and wire fraud among the most frequent crimes the president has wiped clean.",
      "Additionally, about half of the pardon recipients are either business executives or politicians. Included in the latest round of pardons, issued Thursday and Friday, were a former health care CEO, the former governor of Puerto Rico and a pair of siblings who were convicted on fraud charges \u2014 one of whom Trump previously freed for a different crime.",
      "A few pardon recipients are billionaires, including Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, who pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering on his crypto platform; longtime English soccer club owner Joe Lewis, who pleaded guilty last year to insider trading charges; and Venezuelan-Italian banker Julio M. Herrera Velutini, whom Trump pardoned last week while he awaited sentencing on campaign finance violations.",
      "These are aside from the group of roughly 1,500 convicted Jan. 6 rioters he pardoned on his first day back in office and additional symbolic pardons for those involved in efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "While net worth statistics for other pardon recipients aren\u2019t easily available, the amount of fines and restitution that had been imposed on them is a rough signal of their wealth. The 87 people and one corporation pardoned by Trump in the last year had been ordered to pay more than $298 million in fines and restitution \u2014 $20 million more than the total owed by all of the pardon recipients in his entire first term, and vastly more than the totals previously owed by those who received pardons during recent Democratic administrations.",
      "\u201cWe have a very thorough review process here that moves with the Department of Justice and the White House counsel\u2019s office,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at a recent briefing, citing a team of attorneys who review every request that makes its way to Trump. She added: \u201cAnd he was very clear when he came into office that he was most interested in looking at pardoning individuals who were abused and used by the Biden Department of Justice and were overprosecuted by a weaponized DOJ.\u201d",
      "Fines, which are owed to the government, and restitution, which is owed to victims, are intended to make up for the harm caused by crime.",
      "While Trump in his second term has so far granted clemency to a broad range of people convicted of federal crimes, the pardons have often favored political allies or business interests. White House officials have consistently said the president is not focusing on fraud pardons but is focused, as Leavitt said, on cases where he thinks there was a political motivation for the case or an issue of overprosecution.",
      "Asked in an interview with CBS News last year about his pardoning of Zhao, Trump said, \u201cI have no idea who he is. I was told that he was a victim, just like I was and just like many other people, of a vicious, horrible group of people in the Biden administration.\u201d",
      "The president said in the interview he was \u201cnot concerned\u201d about the appearance of corruption. \u201cI\u2019d rather not have you ask the question.\u201d",
      "\u201cI only care about one thing,\u201d said the president. \u201cWill we be No. 1 in crypto?\u201d",
      "The wealth and status associated with many of those pardoned have raised concerns about potential financial and political influence on the clemency process.",
      "NBC News previously reported that the White House temporarily paused the pardon process in order to tighten its review following concerns from top officials that the process had become a lucrative business for lobbying and consulting firms during Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "In the last year, 23 people pardoned by Trump owed more than $100,000 each in fines, restitution or both, with the total exceeding $298 million. It\u2019s not clear whether victims or the government ever received that money.",
      "Those with the highest totals are the cryptocurrency company HDR Global Trading Limited, which was fined $100 million for dodging anti-money laundering requirements; the Binance founder Zhao, who owed $50 million for a similar crime; and businessman Devon Archer, who was ordered to pay back most of  the approximately $60 million he was convicted of defrauding from the Oglala Sioux Tribe.",
      "Thursday\u2019s pardons added two names to the top of the list: siblings Adriana Isabel and Andres Enrique Camberos, who were convicted in a scheme to sell millions of counterfeit bottles of 5-Hour Energy and ordered to pay $49 million in restitution. Adriana Camberos received a commutation from Trump in his first term for a different crime.",
      "Barack Obama, in his two terms as president, pardoned three people who owed more than $100,000, including one who was ordered to pay over $1 million in both fines and restitution, according to government pardon data. In his four years in office, President Joe Biden pardoned two people who owed more than $100,000.",
      "In the four years of his first term, Trump\u2019s pardons nullified convictions that resulted in more than $276 million in fines and restitution. Obama\u2019s pardon recipients owed $2.5 million in total, while Biden\u2019s recipients owed just under $700,000.",
      "The two Democratic presidents also pardoned fewer people each year, on average, than Trump, who pardoned more people in one year than Biden pardoned in four.",
      "NBC News\u2019 analysis of fines and restitution went back to the Obama administration because earlier presidential administrations did not release information about the specific punishments given to each pardon recipient. Data from Obama\u2019s first term came from press releases on an archived White House website. For other administrations, data was drawn from the Office of the Pardon Attorney.",
      "In June, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee released a memo criticizing the president for potentially depriving victims of compensation they are owed and depleting funding for the Victims of Crime Act. The memo accused Trump\u2019s pardons of \u201cundermining public safety at every turn.\u201d",
      "Trump is far from the first president to issue controversial pardons. Historically, many presidents have waited until later in their terms to make pardons that carried some political risk.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "In December 2024, after Trump won re-election, Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden, which he had repeatedly said he wouldn\u2019t do. And on his final day in office, Biden also issued broad pre-emptive pardons for other members of his family, top medical adviser Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and the members of Congress who served on the select committee to investigate the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.",
      "The day before Biden\u2019s inauguration in 2021, Trump pardoned Steve Bannon, the president\u2019s former adviser, whom prosecutors accused of taking hundreds of thousands from his crowdfunding campaign \u201cWe Build the Wall.\u201d (Bannon didn\u2019t make it to trial, but his co-defendants were later convicted or pleaded guilty.)",
      "The same day, the president pardoned former communications executive Gregory Reyes, who owed a $15 million fine, saying Reyes\u2019 conviction had been overturned by an appeals court. While the result of his first trial was overturned, Reyes was retried and the same appeals court affirmed a second conviction.",
      "Trump\u2019s final pardon of his first term went to Albert J. Pirro Jr., the ex-husband of then-Fox News commentator Jeanine Pirro, who would go on to become the top federal prosecutor in Washington, D.C., in Trump\u2019s second administration. Albert Pirro had been convicted in 2000 of conspiracy, four counts of tax evasion and 29 counts of fraud.",
      "This time around, Trump has been quick to use his pardon power, describing it as a tool to hit back against a justice system he feels wronged him and his allies while he was out of office. In a Truth Social post about pardoning Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, the president called himself an \u201cexpert on political weaponization\u201d after being charged in two federal cases, which were handled by a special prosecutor, and two state cases during the Biden administration.",
      "That has even extended to pardoning a man whose sentencing had been touted by Trump\u2019s own administration.",
      "In April 2025, Alina Habba, a Trump ally and then the acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey, celebrated her office\u2019s role in the sentencing of Joseph Schwartz, a wealthy nursing home executive who pleaded guilty to a $38 million tax fraud scheme. The president pardoned Schwartz in November.",
      "Trump has not offered a public explanation for that pardon. The Washington Post reported Schwartz paid $960,000 to have lobbyists work to secure him a presidential pardon.",
      "He is now serving time in Arkansas on similar state charges."

    "summary": "The Supreme Court weighs a challenge to a Hawaii gun restriction dubbed the \u201cvampire rule,\" requiring permission to carry firearms onto private property.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday weighs a challenge to a Hawaii gun restriction dubbed the \u201cvampire rule\u201d because, as with the fictional creatures in folk tales and the novel \u201cDracula,\u201d people carrying firearms are required to seek permission before entering private property.",
      "The justices will weigh whether the requirement, enacted in 2023 as part of a broader gun law, violates the Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment, which protects the right to bear arms.",
      "The Supreme Court\u2019s conservative majority regularly backs gun rights.",
      "Although in most states the law assumes that people can enter private properties while armed if they have a concealed carry permit, several states have joined Hawaii in flipping that rule. The others are New York, New Jersey, Maryland and California.",
      "The Hawaii measure concerns a host of private properties that are generally open to the public, such as gas stations, stores and restaurants. Lower courts have partly blocked other provisions of the law that impose different restrictions on where people can take guns.",
      "People who violate the private property provision can face up to a year in prison.",
      "The law was challenged by three gun owners with concealed carry licenses, Maui residents Jason Wolford, Alison Wolford and Atom Kasprzycki, as well as the Hawaii Firearms Coalition, a gun rights group. The Trump administration has filed a brief backing the challengers.",
      "A federal judge earlier blocked the private property provision, but the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the state\u2019s favor in a September 2024 ruling.",
      "Gun rights advocates say the \u201cvampire rule\u201d effectively nullifies the right to carry a firearm in public, which the Supreme Court endorsed in a major 2022 ruling that found for the first time that the right to bear arms under the Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment extends outside the home.",
      "\u201cHawaii\u2019s intent to eliminate the right to carry is both self-evident and illegitimate,\u201d lawyers for the challengers said in court papers.",
      "Hawaii and gun control advocates stress the state\u2019s separate interest in protecting property rights, which are also enshrined in the Constitution.",
      "\u201cSince our founding as a nation, private property rights have been foundational to American identity and embedded throughout our system of government and our Constitution,\u201d Douglas Letter, chief legal officer at the gun control group Brady, told reporters last week.",
      "The 2022 Supreme Court ruling led both to a surge of new gun laws being passed and a wave of new challenges to long-standing firearms restrictions.",
      "In its most recent Second Amendment case, the court in 2024 appeared to backtrack somewhat on that 2022 ruling, upholding a federal law that prohibits people subject to domestic violence restraining orders from possessing firearms.",
      "The justices are hearing another gun case in March, on whether a federal law that bars users of illegal drugs from possessing firearms is unconstitutional. Hunter Biden, the former president\u2019s son, was convicted under that law before his father pardoned him.",
      "The concept of vampires not being able to enter properties without consent was popularized in Bram Stoker\u2019s classic book \u201cDracula,\u201d in which one of the characters, professor Van Helsing, states: \u201cHe may not enter anywhere at the first, unless there be someone of the household who bid him to come.\u201d"

      "The year 2016 is making a comeback in 2026 as people flood Instagram with throwback posts reminiscing about what they viewed as an iconic year for popular culture and the internet.",
      "In the past two weeks, many people online \u2014 from celebrities to regular Instagram users \u2014 dug through their camera rolls and Snapchat memories to unearth hyper-filtered photos of themselves a decade ago.",
      "Many of the photos share common themes now emblematic of the era: a matte lip and winged eyeliner, bold eyebrows and glamorous eye shadow. Acai bowls and boxed water. Chokers, aviator glasses and boho outfits made trendy by Coachella.",
      "\u201cWhen I\u2019m seeing people\u2019s 2016 posts, even if they were in different states or slightly different ages, there\u2019s all these similarities, like that dog filter or those chokers or The Chainsmokers,\u201d said Katrina Yip, one of many people online who posted 2016 throwback photos. \u201cIt makes it so funny to realize that we were all part of this big movement that we didn\u2019t really even know at the time was, like, just following the trend of that time.\u201d",
      "The trend has become the latest example of people online romanticizing a different time as a form of escapism. Last year, Gen Zers, typically defined as those ages 14-29, posted videos expressing love for the charm and \"cringe\" of millennials. There has also been a recent surge in millennial-focused pop culture, which has been celebrated online.",
      "To many millennials and older Gen Z, 2016 was a year when community flourished on social media. People dumped their entire camera rolls into messy Facebook photo albums, sent each other silly Snapchat selfies and eagerly posted what they ate for brunch.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re older, like maybe you were 50 in 2016 and you weren\u2019t on Instagram or a heavy internet user, you might be like, \u2018Why does everyone care about this random year?\u2019\u201d said Steffy Degreff, who shared her own throwback photos last week.",
      "Degreff, 38, said that for those who\u2019ve been on social media for more than a decade, there\u2019s nostalgia for the way social media used to function \u2014 with chronological feeds that focused only on the users people followed. There used to be an end to scrolling (specifically, when you ran out of updates from your friends). Platforms back then felt \u201ca little bit less malicious\u201d in their design, she said.",
      "\u201cI do think that 2016 was the beginning of the end of a golden era of when people felt really good about the internet and social media and politics,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd then, obviously, the pandemic happened.\u201d",
      "Many online who voiced their nostalgia described the overall energy of 2016 as \u201ccolorful\u201d and \u201ccarefree.\u201d",
      "People often went out in crop tops and jeans with a flannel tied around their waist. They\u2019d snap pictures of an outfit laid out carefully on their bed or of a giant acai bowl. Then, they\u2019d pore over VSCO (a popular photo editing app) filters with their friends, debating which preset to choose.",
      "\u201cNow, we\u2019ve gone very neutral-toned, like quiet luxury aesthetic, very minimal,\u201d said Paige Lorentzen, who shared throwback photos featuring some of the trendiest brands of the time, such as Boxed Water Is Better and Triangl Swimwear. \u201cWhereas back then, it was the brighter the saturation on your photos, the better. Everything felt like summer.\u201d",
      "The new year marked exactly 10 years since 2016; therefore, many online began posting the phrase \u201c2026 is the new 2016,\u201d according to the database Know Your Meme.",
      "But \u201cas the trend carried on, some social media users began posting videos denouncing the idea of making 2026 the new 2016, citing problems with living in the past and pointing out bad things that happened in 2016,\u201d Know Your Meme added.",
      "\"Why is everyone trying to bring back 2016? Please don\u2019t actually,\" wrote an X user.",
      "\"i thought we all agreed that was a terrible year,\" another X user wrote.",
      "The publication The Cut even titled its recent article about the trend, \u201cWho would want to relive this?\u201d",
      "The author of the article said the year had a multitude of lows, including, but not limited, to: Brexit (referring to the United Kingdom\u2019s leaving the European Union); the mass shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 people were killed and 53 were wounded); the police shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile; and a Zika outbreak.",
      "Still, some who look back fondly on the era, especially those who were in their teens in 2016, said life felt more carefree then.",
      "\u201cI know people\u2019s perceptions of 2016 are based on their own experiences, but for me it was senior year of college. I lived by the beach; I didn\u2019t have many college classes left,\u201d said Lorentzen, 31. \u201cIt was before adulthood. So it kind of just embodied that carefree young California girl era.\u201d",
      "It was also before the concept of content creation began to dominate. While YouTubers and Instagram influencers existed, they seemed fewer and further away. And TikTok wasn\u2019t around yet, although people would achieve stratospheric Vine stardom from time to time.",
      "Some, like Yip, said that nowadays, her non-content creator friends and acquaintances rarely post online anymore unless it\u2019s for a major life milestone.",
      "\u201cIt was OK to be cringey, you know?\u201d Yip said. \u201cPeople were just posting for their friends. The people you followed on social media were just people you knew in real life. They weren\u2019t celebrities or educational accounts, and so everything just felt like you were more in a little personal bubble.\u201d",
      "Content creator Teala Dunn, who grew a massive YouTube following sharing morning routines and vlogs in the mid-2010s, was one of the era\u2019s trendiest influencers, particularly for teenage girls. She said that when she thinks of 2016, she recalls \u201cfun and freedom and lightheartedness.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe internet was so popular, like a lot of things were starting to become really viral and fun,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cAnd I feel like a lot of people, especially influencers and YouTubers and all of my friends, we didn\u2019t take things too seriously.\u201d",
      "Dunn said that the dynamic online has shifted to become drastically more parasocial and that harassment from strangers comes much more easily now than it did before. While Dunn still creates content now, she said she has scaled back how much she\u2019s willing to reveal about her personal life.",
      "And she, like many others, noted that 2016 seemed like one of the last years when life felt \u201cnormal.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t realize how much we took for granted normal life pre-Covid. Like, pre-Covid was a completely different time,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cI feel like the news was still crazy, but it was definitely not as crazy as the news is now. I feel like we can all agree to that. Things were just a lot more fun.\u201d"

      "The Bravo star couldn\u2019t contain her excitement about the role. \u201cMy heart is pounding out of my chest. I\u2019m happy. I get to lie, deceive, and kill people!\u201d she celebrated, throwing her hands triumphantly in the air.",

      "As for why she might be perceived as dangerous? \u201cWhy am I a threat? Well, I think because I\u2019m Lisa f---ing Rinna,\u201d she told host Alan Cumming with the confidence only she could deliver.",

      "The popularity of \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d which tells the story of multiple NHL players who are closeted, has led one real-life hockey player to come out as gay.",
      "The main romance in \u201cHeated Rivalry,\u201d streaming on HBO Max, follows rival players Ilya (Connor Storrie) and Shane (Hudson Williams) and their secret relationship that spans multiple years. But one episode centers around the storyline between another closeted player named Scott Hunter (Fran\u00e7ois Arnaud), who falls for an employee he meets at a smoothie shop named Kip (Robbie G.K.).",
      "At the end of Episode 5, Scott decides to publicly come out and invites Kip onto the ice to celebrate with him after his team wins the Stanley Cup. Scott and Kip share a passionate kiss and the hockey star later expresses his love for Kip while accepting an award.",
      "After seeing the show and being inspired by the storylines, hockey player Jesse Kortuem decided to publicly come out.",
      "In a statement posted on Facebook Jan. 13, Kortuem wrote that the sounds heard in a hockey arena used to represent \u201cthe sound of a place where I felt I had to hide.\u201d",
      "The athlete, who recently participated in the Cutting Edges Hockey Club\u2019s Winter Classic event, added, \u201cI am a private person. Those who know me best know that I don\u2019t share much if anything publicly on social media, but lately, something has sparked in me (ok \u2014 yes credit to #HeatedRivalry). I realized it is finally time to share a journey I have kept close to the vest for a long time.\u201d",
      "Kortuem said he grew up in Minnesota as the youngest of four boys.",
      "\u201cAs a young teenager, I carried a weight that did not seem to fit into that world, and I lived in a constant state of dichotomy. I loved the game, but I lived with a persistent fear,\u201d he shared. \u201cI wondered how I could be gay and still play such a tough and masculine sport.\u201d",
      "He said his younger self never thought that coming out was possible as a professional hockey player. \u201cComing out in the 2000s did not feel like an option, especially with so little positive representation in the media at the time and it would have been a social disaster at such a large high school. At 17, I walked away from the high school team and the brotherhood of hockey friendships I had developed from a young age for a myriad of reasons,\u201d he explained.",
      "After stepping away, he returned to hockey and played \u201cat a high level\u201d in New York and Atlanta. He said people in his life knew he was gay, but he didn\u2019t speak about his sexuality with his teammates.",
      "\u201cOn the outside, I was still a top-tier player. On the inside, I was still that kid in Minnesota hiding,\u201d he recalled. \u201cLike many closeted athletes, revealing who I truly was to my team would change everything in an instant, their opinion of me, could bring negative attention to the team with the \u2018gay player\u2019, so I never took the chance.\u201d",
      "He remembered changing the subject if the other players mentioned their wives, and he always told them he was single. But he \u201creached a breaking point in 2017\u201d after he signed up to play in a gay sporting event.",
      "\u201cThis tournament would prove to be a paradigm shift. I met a group of guys from across the US and Canada (Las Vegas Boyz) who were hockey players like me and were also gay,\u201d Kortuem said. \u201cFrom that moment forward, my life has never been the same. It has been a long, vulnerable road to move past the closeted athlete persona (something I\u2019m still working on today) and find actual peace through the friendships I have developed through hockey in Vancouver (Cutting Edges), Toronto (Misfits), and across the US.\u201d",
      "He said during his most recent event with the Cutting Edges Hockey Club, he finally felt \u201cpeace\u201d on the rink.",
      "Kortuem ended his post with an uplifting message to other closeted athletes.",
      "\u201cThis is my story. It is not everyone\u2019s story, but for what it is worth, I thought I would share because I want to speak to the athletes out there who are still in the closet or struggling to find their way. I want you to know that there is hope and you\u2019re not alone. There is a life and a deep happiness waiting for you on your path. You will get through this, and it is going to be okay,\u201d he said.",
      "According to Out, Kortuem never played in the NHL, however, he did play defenseman and center in multiple other leagues.",
      "\u201cI know many closeted and gay men in the hockey world are being hit hard by \u2018Heated Rivalry\u2019\u2019s success,\u201d Kortuem said when speaking to Out about how he personally connected to the show. \u201cNever in my life did I think something so positive and loving could come from such a masculine sport. I\u2019ve struggled the last few weeks to put these emotions into words, fearing the impact on team dynamics, etc.\u201d",
      "He continued, \u201cToday, I took the step to finally tell my hockey journey and my story. I\u2019m beyond grateful for all the positive comments I\u2019ve received from past teammates and high school teammates.\u201d"

The windows behind him, though curtained, looked out at all the fans who braved sub-40\u00b0 weather for a glimpse of him. He told us about meeting Reid, what he hopes to see next on-screen from Shane and Ilya\u2019s relationship and what he gives credit to regarding his electric chemistry with Williams.",
      "I think that Jacob just \u2014 he read the books a million times, and obviously wrote hundreds and hundreds of pages worth of scripts. He just knew this story backward and forward. I think he also was just such a fan that he saw whatever the fans of the book saw \u2014 that thing that makes everyone love this story.",
      "What that is, I think, can be a few different things. I think the love, the spice, the world, the connection. I think he was just a really, really big fan, and I think that love poured over into his interpretation of it.",
      "Everything that Jacob wrote in that monologue totally tracks, and I think that it really honors the book. Everything that (Ilya) has going on in his personal life, I kind of just have to click into that and believe that. And those words are so powerful that I think you can\u2019t really help but be moved. Professing your love for someone, especially in such a stressful moment, having this cathartic outbreak, you can\u2019t help but be emotional if you believe in it."

      "An app by that name has gone viral as a digital \u201ccheck-in\u201d aimed mainly at the growing number of young people living alone in China\u2019s sprawling cities. The idea is to designate an emergency contact person, who will be alerted if a user goes a few days without confirming their well-being on the app.",
      "The app, which was free when it launched last May but now costs 8 yuan ($1.14), was the most downloaded paid app in Apple\u2019s App Store for China in recent days \u2014 though after its viral popularity, it appears to have since disappeared from the Chinese App Store under unclear circumstances.",
      "The app describes itself as a personal safety assistant, \u201cwhether you are a professional living solo, a student studying far from home, or anyone choosing an independent lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Ian Guo, one of the founders, told NBC News he was surprised by the success of the app, which cost less than $150 to make and is now valued at around $15 million.",
      "He said he and his two co-founders, who like him are members of China\u2019s \u201cpost-95 generation,\u201d were inspired by social media commenters who said this was something they needed.",
      "\u201cWe saw this opportunity and asked ourselves if we could quickly launch a product,\u201d Guo said. But they also believed the app \u201ccould truly provide people with more security and protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cI personally lived alone in Shenzhen for a long time, so I understand the various problems one faces when living solo,\u201d he said, adding that the sense of loneliness and insecurity \u201cis constant.\u201d",
      "Though the concept may sound morbid, the app\u2019s popularity is a reflection of demographic changes in China, where urbanization, falling marriage rates and long work hours have left many feeling isolated.",
      "By 2030, China \u2014 a nation of 1.4 billion people \u2014 could have 200 million one-person households, according to the state-backed Global Times newspaper, which cited real estate research institutions.",
      "The app\u2019s name in Mandarin, \u201cSi Le Ma,\u201d appeared to be a play on the name of one of China\u2019s most popular food delivery apps, \u201cE Le Ma,\u201d which means \u201cAre You Hungry?\u201d Some found its emphasis on death too dark, and the app has now been renamed Demumu, which Guo said was \u201ccuter.\u201d",
      "\"\u2018Are You Dead?\u2019 sounds more like a joke,\" says Lisa Li, a 23-year-old English teacher. \"But Are You Alive? sounds like you\u2019re rising from the dead, and that would be even weirder.\"",
      "Li, 23, said she found the app \u201ca bit absurd.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019d be afraid that if I were forgetful and missed a check-in, people would actually think I\u2019m dead,\u201d she said.",
      "She said she thought most people were downloading the app out of curiosity. \u201cSome people really do worry that if they die, no one will find them,\u201d she added, pointing to a recent string of highly publicized cases of young Chinese professionals, particularly at tech companies, dying suddenly after long periods of intense work.",
      "Cui Xiyue, an exhibition planner in Beijing, said she downloaded the app when she was \u201cgoing through a period of depression and mental health issues.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust getting through a single day back then wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d said Cui, 23.",
      "\u201cWhen I first got it, I checked in every day, but I didn\u2019t stick with it for very long,\u201d she said. \u201cI probably don\u2019t need it anymore, because I\u2019ve stopped thinking about those dark things.\u201d",
      "Loneliness has long been a concern for older people in China, where more than one-fifth of the population is over 60. When younger family members migrate from rural areas to cities, they are often left behind.",
      "But social isolation is also a problem for young Chinese, who are increasingly reluctant to get married and have children amid the rising cost of living and competition for jobs.",
      "Yuying Tong, a sociology professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said she thought the app would be helpful for young people living alone.",
      "\u201cOf course, to some extent they are joking, it\u2019s more sarcastic,\u201d said Tong, co-director of the university\u2019s Centre for Chinese Family Studies. On the other hand, she said, the app could lead people to reflect on their single life.",
      "Some commenters on Chinese social media were skeptical of the app\u2019s usefulness.",
      "\u201cDo people really use apps like this? If I get busy and forget to check in, wouldn\u2019t I end up \u2018dying\u2019 every other day?\u201d read one comment on Weibo.",

      "\u201cThis crackdown is more intense because the scope of the protests is more widespread, playing out at the same time in big cities but also remote areas in central and western Iran,\u201d said Cl\u00e9ment Therme, a nonresident fellow at the International Institute for Iranian Studies, a nongovernmental organization based in Saudi Arabia, Iran\u2019s major geopolitical rival in the region.",
      "Since widespread demonstrations in 2022, the regime's goal \u201chas been to diffuse fear,\u201d both through killing protesters and executing prisoners, he said.",
      "Even the partial picture of what\u2019s happening inside Iran suggests something on a different level than past repression. The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a nonpartisan Virginia-based organization that relies on supporters inside Iran to track the protests and monitor deaths, says that demonstrations spread to all of the country\u2019s 31 provinces.",
      "The bloody reprisals against protesters are the culmination of decades in which the regime\u2019s \u201cpropensity and ability to use violence\u201d have only increased, said Rouzbeh Parsi, an adjunct lecturer at Sweden\u2019s Lund University. The reason for that is the twin fear of \u201cexternal pressure\u201d and \u201cdomestic hatred\u201d converging, he said.",
      "Some 19,000 people have been arrested, according to HRANA, which says its data comes from on-the-ground sources and goes through multiple internal checks. Iran\u2019s top judge has suggested that there needs to be rapid trials and executions to restore order.",

The scene is punctuated by screams and wails as people converge at the site in search of missing loved ones amid the chaos of the demonstrations. Another video verified by NBC News appears to show security forces firing automatic weapons at demonstrators, the shots echoing through the streets.",
      "Though the internet has now been down for more than a week, Iranians have been able to make some international calls. In calls to The Associated Press earlier this week, Iranians described a heavy security presence on the streets and light foot traffic despite shops reopening.",

      "That surveillance tallies with what Samira Mohyeddin, an Iranian-Canadian journalist, said she was told by a friend\u2019s daughter from the southern Mazandaran province.",
      "Posting a video on X of the conversation in Persian, Mohyeddin recounted that there was \u201cblood on the streets\u201d with drones and riot police maintaining order, and shops forced to close at 4 p.m. She said there had been no clashes in the past two days.",
      "The Iranian regime has decades of precedent for using violence to suppress its opponents, dating back to its foundation.",
      "In 1979, a popular revolution involving students and oil workers toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, an autocratic ruler bolstered by a CIA-backed coup in 1953, and whose SAVAK secret police imprisoned and tortured opponents.",

In 1988, at least 5,000 political prisoners were forcibly disappeared, executed and dumped in mass graves, according to Amnesty International and other human rights groups.",
      "Then, 2009 brought the \u201cGreen Movement\u201d when millions took to the streets in protest at the apparently rigged re-election of then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner. At least 72 people were killed and hundreds more injured, according to opposition figures.",
      "Street marches flared again in 2017, 2018 and 2019, the latter seeing 321 people killed by security forces after demonstrating against rising oil prices, according to Amnesty.",
      "Another high water mark came in 2022 after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish woman,  died in a hospital after her arrest three days earlier by the country\u2019s morality police.

      "People opposed to the regime have been protesting in the streets across Iran for the last three weeks. The country\u2019s leadership cut off internet and phone access last week as protests and unrest gripped many parts of the country. It\u2019s a tactic that the Human Rights Watch says has helped the regime \u201cconceal widespread atrocities.\u201d",
      "According to the U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 2,500 people have been killed in the mass protests across the country. (The agency relies on supporters inside Iran for information it then compiles and releases to the public. Iranian authorities have not provided an official death toll.)",

      "In addition to the ongoing total ban on international internet traffic, the government also initially blocked international phone calls and access to local networks that had stayed operational during previous blackouts, said Doug Madory, the director of internet analysis at Kentik, a company that tracks internet connectivity.",

That has somewhat been mitigated when Starlink forced an update to their terminals earlier this week, he said.",
      "\u201cSatellite internet during this total blackout has proven to be the only way that people were able to get the information out,\u201d he said.",
      "But that may change soon, Rashidi said, as Iran\u2019s government is actively working to improve its ability to invasively capture internet traffic as it travels to and from the satellites and identify the people using the devices.",
      "Starlink is fairly simple to use: A person just needs a small device called a terminal, which can connect to fleets of low-orbit satellites constantly circling the earth and provide a Wi-Fi signal to people nearby.",
      "But until this week, many terminals hadn\u2019t worked for many Iranians, Ahmadian said, as they usually require a paid subscription that often doesn\u2019t accept money from Iranian banks and credit cards. That changed when SpaceX suddenly waived the subscription fee for people in Iran, he said.",
      "SpaceX did not respond to a request for comment. Musk, who regularly posts on X about Starlink, has not posted about it in relation to Iran, but earlier in the month boosted the company\u2019s post about providing free service to people in Venezuela through Feb. 3.",
      "Ahmadian said his group and others have worked for several years to smuggle Starlink terminals into the country, with a thriving black market for them.",
      "Iran\u2019s internet shutdown could last for months, Rashidi said, and getting terminals into the country is not easy. One activist group that has worked to get Starlink terminals into the country, NetFreedom Pioneers, showed how laborious the process can be.",
      "The group has raised nearly $50,000 on GoFundMe since June 2025, with recent donations surging alongside the protests. Though terminals generally range in cost from between $300 and $600, the group said in November that it had delivered 17 Starlink kits to people in Iran between June and September, at a cost of more than $18,000 to cover devices, subscriptions and the logistics to get them into the country.",
      "Most Iranians are unlikely to be able to afford the price tag \u2014  the rial currency plunged to an all-time low against the U.S. dollar and euro. The country has also been crippled in recent years in part by sanctions from the U.S. and other international entities over the regime\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Online activists have also recently encouraged those in the U.S. to lobby their representatives to ask companies, including SpaceX, to enable direct-to-cell satellite internet to bypass the regime\u2019s blackout efforts."

      "He joins a group President Donald Trump has called the \u201cGreatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place,\u201d which also includes Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "\u201cThe Board of Peace will play an essential role in fulfilling all 20 points of the President\u2019s plan, providing strategic oversight, mobilizing international resources, and ensuring accountability as Gaza transitions from conflict to peace and development,\u201d the White House said in a statement Friday.",
      "Day-to-day operations in Gaza are expected to be overseen by a separate technocratic committee, headed by Ali Shaath, a former planning minister for the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank. Shaath has proposed pushing the rubble of destroyed buildings into the sea to create \u201cnew land for Gaza.\u201d",
      "Private equity mogul Marc Rowan, World Bank chief Ajay Banga and U.S. deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel are also on the board, with additional members to be announced in the coming weeks, according to the White House.",

      "A ceasefire has largely held in Gaza since the first phase of the peace plan was unveiled by Trump in October. While the board\u2019s formation marks a new phase in the Trump administration\u2019s vision for long-term peace in the enclave, analysts say its potential impact remains uncertain, while key questions remain about its authority, membership and influence on the ground.",
      "Blair won three consecutive elections in Britain between 1997 and 2005 but remains one of the most divisive names in British politics despite having left the stage almost 20 years ago.",
      "Some in Britain laud his landmark achievements, such as introducing the minimum wage, pouring investment into public services and helping secure peace in Northern Ireland. But for many others, his name is a byword for the Iraq War after he relied on flawed intelligence to join President George W. Bush in the 2003 invasion despite strong public opposition in the U.K.",
      "A landmark British inquiry in 2016 found the basis for going to war was \u201cfar from satisfactory.\u201d After that chastening conclusion, Blair expressed \u201csorrow, regret and apology\u201d and took \u201cfull responsibility without exception or excuse\u201d for the war\u2019s consequences.",
      "Blair, whose post-Iraq career included a stint as global Middle East envoy, \u201cis very divisive,\u201d said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics.",
      "\u201cHe carries heavy baggage,\u201d he told NBC News. \u201cMany Iraqis and many Arabs and many Muslims and many human rights organizations have accused Tony Blair of having blood on his hands.\u201d",
      "Blair\u2019s position \u201cas hardcore an advocate of Israel as the other six Americans on the board,\u201d Gerges added, \u201cdoes not really send a reassuring message to either Palestinians or Arabs.\u201d",
      "Israel and Hamas have both accused each other of breaching the ceasefire and failing to honor their commitments under the agreement. Israel has killed nearly 450 Palestinians since the ceasefire began, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "The disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza proved to be sticking points in earlier negotiations, and it also remains unclear when Israel will withdraw farther behind the  \u201cyellow line\u201d inside Gaza that currently marks the area it still controls.",
      "The U.S. has pushed forward with the next phase of its plan for peace in Gaza, moving toward \u201cdemilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction,\u201d Witkoff said Wednesday, without offering details of immediate further steps that might overcome hurdles in negotiations.",
      "Yossi Mekelberg, a senior consulting fellow with the Middle East and North Africa program at the U.K. think tank Chatham House, said it was too early to predict the impact of the board, which for now amounted only to a \u201clist of names,\u201d with little clarity on how power, budgets or decision-making would work in practice.",
      "Speaking to NBC News, he acknowledged that those involved may have good intentions, but what matters is \u201cwhat happens to the people of Gaza,\u201d stressing that any rebuilding effort must be led by Palestinians and supported, rather than dictated, by the international community.",
      "\u201cIf this board of peace is ready to do that, fine, let them do that,\u201d he said."

      "LONDON \u2014 It has been a familiar sight over the past decade: Prince Harry on the steps of a British courthouse for the latest round of his battle with a tabloid newspaper.",
      "But he arrived at London\u2019s High Court again on Monday, for what could be the final time he takes on the British press, which he has accused of bullying and harassment and has blamed for the death of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales. And some royal watchers say the end of his legal campaign could pave the way for a reconciliation with his father, King Charles III.",
      "\u201cWe know that Harry\u2019s various legal issues and trials have been the primary cause of the breakdown in the relationship between Charles and Harry,\u201d NBC News\u2019 royal contributor Daisy McAndrew said in an interview on Monday. \u201cI think a lot of people within the royal family and outside will be hoping that once these court battles are over, Harry can turn his attention to reconciling with his family,\u201d she added.",
      "This time around, Harry will be joined by Elton John and his husband, David Furnish, actors Sadie Frost and Elizabeth Hurley and former lawmaker Simon Hughes in his case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), the publisher of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday newspapers.",
      "Baroness Doreen Lawrence, whose son Stephen Lawrence was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, will also join the claimants. Her inclusion has been seen by some as significant because the Daily Mail campaigned for a long time to bring her son\u2019s killers to justice, famously naming five people as his murderers on its front page. When two of the men, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were eventually convicted, the paper was praised for its coverage.",
      "The group\u2019s lawyers have accused ANL of \u201cgrave breaches of privacy\u201d and alleged that the newspaper group commissioned private investigators to unlawfully target their clients, tapped and hacked their phones, and obtained private medical and financial records through deception, chiefly between 1993 and 2011.",
      "Associated Newspapers Limited has strenuously denied the allegations. Asked for comment ahead of the trial on Thursday, the company referred NBC News to a previous statement issued in 2024 that called the claims \u201cpreposterous and without foundation.\u201d It added that its defense submission said \u201cthe case brought by the Prince and others is \u2018an affront to the hard-working journalists whose reputations and integrity, as well as those of Associated itself, are wrongly traduced.\u2019\u201d",
      "Unlike Lawrence, Harry is no stranger to this kind of litigation, having successfully sued Mirror Group Newspapers in 2023 and last year received \u201csubstantial damages\u201d and an apology after settling a claim against News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun.",
      "Both companies have paid out tens of millions of dollars to multiple claimants including celebrities, politicians and ordinary people after it emerged that some of their journalists and private investigators employed by their newspapers were hacking into phones and intercepting voicemails in the early 2000s.",
      "Until now, however, Associated Newspapers Limited has not been sued for phone hacking, which, if proved, \u201cwill reshape the story of modern British journalism,\u201d according to media lawyer Mark Stephens.",
      "\u201cHarry and his team characterize this as the last major test of the untouchable corner of the British press,\u201d Stephens, who works at the London-based law firm Howard Kennedy LLP, said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cIt asks whether a major U.K. publisher has been operating in the shadows or is genuinely clean,\u201d he added, referring to the fact that allegations of this nature have not been made against the Daily Mail or Mail on Sunday before.",
      "The claimants, he said, will be relying on a \u201cmosaic of inferences\u201d that, in their totality, will need to demonstrate that \u201cmore probably than not\u201d phone hacking and unlawful information gathering did occur.",
      "It is unlikely that a settlement will be reached before the start of the trial, he said. \u201cI think if it was going to settle, it would have done so by now,\u201d he added. \u201cNo newspaper will want to have the scrutiny of this and would have settled if they thought they didn\u2019t have a decent case.\u201d",
      "Whatever the outcome, NBC News\u2019 royal contributor Emily Nash said that once he ends his legal battles, Harry might be able to patch up relations with his family, which became strained after he quit front-line royal duties in 2020, along with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, before they moved to California.",
      "\u201cMembers of the royal family traditionally use the maxim \u2018Never complain, never explain,\u2019 but they do pursue legal action if they feel they\u2019ve been wronged,\u201d she said in a video call Monday. \u201cWhat they tend to do, though, is do it in a far more low-key manner,\u201d she added. \u201cThey will settle out of court rather than have their personal information brought up in a public domain.\u201d",
      "Another source of contention has been Harry\u2019s legal battle to have his police protection reinstated when he visits the U.K. The decision to strip him of publicly funded protection was made by the Executive Committee for the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures, known by the acronym RAVEC, which approves security for the royals and VIPs, such as the prime minister.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "After he lost a legal challenge to that ruling in May, Harry told the BBC that it was not safe to bring his family back to the U.K. because he could not guarantee their protection.",
      "His father would not speak to him \u201cbecause of this security stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI would love reconciliation with my family. There\u2019s no point in continuing to fight anymore,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much longer my father has.\u201d",
      "Harry, who is expected to testify on Thursday, met with Charles for the first time in 19 months in September, and if he does come to London for the case, it is unlikely they will reconcile, as Charles will be in Scotland for his traditional post-Christmas stay, which typically lasts for most of January.",
      "Either way, it is unclear what will be required for the pair to patch things up, according to McAndrew, NBC News\u2019 royal contributor.",
      "Harry\u2019s brother, Prince William, and Charles \u201cwill want some sort of guarantees that Harry will stop talking, ironically, to the press or writing books or doing documentaries and putting his side of the story out there in a way that impacts and sometimes detrimentally harms the rest of the royal family,\u201d she said."

      "COPENHAGEN, Denmark \u2014 On a cold, foggy afternoon in downtown Copenhagen, military veteran Flemming Almind joined thousands of his fellow Danes in what he said was the first protest he\u2019s ever participated in, opposing the Trump administration\u2019s push to acquire Greenland.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve actually never done this before, demonstrating, but this is very important to me,\u201d Almind, 57, told NBC News. He said he had been following developments and felt \u201cI need to do something.\u201d",
      "An estimated 10,000 Danes gathered in the city hall square Saturday afternoon to express their frustration with President Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric.",
      "The crowd, which included parents with small children as well as older Danes, wore hats in the style of Trump\u2019s MAGA caps but scrawled with \u201cMake America Go Away,\u201d and waved Greenlandic flags and signs saying, \u201cHands off Greenland.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have to support Greenland,\u201d said protester Susanne Kristensen. \u201cWe are Danes, Greenland are Danes, even though they\u2019re Greenlanders, and we just have to stick together.\u201d",
      "Some protesters expressed fears that if they spoke out about Trump in the press or on social media, his administration could bar them from visiting the United States while he was in office. \u201cI won\u2019t go there until he\u2019s out,\u201d Kristensen said.",
      "The protest came just before Trump announced fresh tariffs on Denmark and its allies, a step that has infuriated European leaders and threatens to reignite a trade war that was meant to have been settled with a deal signed by Trump months ago.",
      "A bipartisan U.S. congressional delegation, intending to express solidarity with the country in the face of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, was meanwhile wrapping up a visit to the Danish capital, where it met with the Danish prime minister and key Danish and Greenlandic officials.",
      "The visit by the group of 10 American lawmakers from both the House and Senate has not gone unnoticed, with the protesters saying they were closely following the developments. \u201cIt makes a huge difference that Congress members come here and listen,\u201d Kristime Due, who was attending the protest in Copenhagen, told NBC News.",
      "The delegation\u2019s visit was arranged on short notice and has played an almost counterprogramming role to the statements the Trump administration has been making. Trump\u2019s desire to own a part of the Danish kingdom is all over the airwaves in Danish news broadcasts, and Danes say it\u2019s a constant conversation.",
      "\u201cThis is a respectful and constructive delegation that came more to listen than to talk,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., told reporters on Saturday.",
      "\u201cOne thing that\u2019s been made clear to us is that the people of Denmark are very anxious, are quite concerned, and the people of Greenland even more so,\u201d Coons said, adding that the current tone of statements from the White House is \u201cnot constructive.\u201d",
      "Coons said the delegation is \u201chaving active conversations amongst ourselves about what is the wisest course of action\u201d to de-escalate the rhetoric when they return to Washington, but some members of the delegation do not want to rush into a hasty symbolic vote that could fall along party lines.",
      "\u201cI worry that going to a specific legislative vehicle right now today is premature,\u201d Coons said.",
      "\u201cWe cannot allow this to become a partisan matter. We simply cannot,\u201d Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said. \u201cI think the way that we keep it from being partisan is by full education, dismissing some of the assumptions that some may have and then acting together,\u201d she added.",
      "The members of Congress met with members of the Danish Parliament on Friday, with the Social Democrats\u2019 foreign affairs spokesman, Flemming M\u00f8ller Mortensen, describing the discussion as \u201cfruitful\u201d and \u201cintense.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe feel frightened,\u201d Mortensen said. \u201cEspecially the people living in Greenland, both adults but also youngsters and kids, and that was also a part of what their Greenlandic colleagues [were] expressing today.\u201d",
      "Aaja Chemnitz, who is one of two Greenlandic representatives in the Danish Parliament, said that the \u201cuncertainty is really taking a toll\u201d on her people.",
      "\u201cGreenland is not for sale,\u201d Chemnitz said. \u201cSo what is on the table for the U.S. side right now is not interesting for us, and you can\u2019t buy a country.\u201d",
      "Pipaluk Lynge, a member of the Greenlandic Parliament, traveled to Copenhagen to participate in the meeting.",
      "\u201cIt was really important for us to tell them from our own voice, because we know how it is back home,\u201d Lynge said. \u201cThe children are worried; the adults are not sleeping.\u201d",
      "Both sides stressed Denmark\u2019s willingness for more U.S. military presence in Greenland.",
      "The U.S. has one military base in the Arctic territory, which has formed a core part of missile early-warning systems dating back to the Cold War. The base, which houses a small number of troops compared to thousands at its peak, was transferred to the U.S. Space Force in 2019, during the first Trump administration.",
      "While the Trump administration\u2019s push to take Greenland has started to fray the decades-old alliance between the U.S. and Denmark, some are concerned about the broader impact on NATO if it moves to seize an ally\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cIf the United States were to carry out any of the current threats against Greenland, it would sever NATO,\u201d Coons told NBC News in an interview. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d",
      "The Danes are keenly aware of how the alliance between the two countries has seen sacrifices in the past.",
      "\u201cIn Afghanistan and Iraq, Danes were actually serving alongside the American soldiers, and Denmark lost, per capita, a lot of soldiers,\u201d Almind, the military veteran, said at the protest in Copenhagen. \u201cLooking back, you have to ask yourself, was it all worth it?\u201d",
      "While Danes are hopeful that the U.S. delegation\u2019s support will resonate once they return to Washington, some are skeptical they can convince the president to change his mind when he seems determined to acquire Greenland at any cost.",
      "Danish protester Else Hatmann said the delegation contained \u201conly two [Republicans] who Trump don\u2019t even listen to.\u201d",
      "Murkowski, a frequent holdout who Trump earlier this month said \u201cshould never be elected to office again,\u201d pushed back against that sentiment, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think that the absence of Republicans is because they don\u2019t care about this issue.\u201d",
      "The other Republican on the trip, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., has become an outspoken critic of Trump since he announced he would not run for re-election, but avoided interacting with reporters during the press events the delegation held."

    "story": [
      "Has Europe had enough?",
      "After more than a year of cautious diplomacy, high-stakes flattery and efforts to keep trans-Atlantic cooperation intact, European leaders now find themselves confronting perhaps the sharpest challenge yet from the White House.",
      "President Donald Trump said Saturday he will impose sweeping new tariffs on eight key European allies that will ratchet up unless Denmark agrees to hand over Greenland, resurrecting one of his most provocative foreign policy obsessions as he threatens the territory of a NATO ally.",
      "The ultimatum marks the latest escalation in a pattern that has seen Europe repeatedly forced onto the back foot during Trump\u2019s second administration, weighing economic and security ties with the U.S. against a White House increasingly willing to weaponize trade against its closest partners.",
      "But this time the response has been sharper.",
      "European leaders moved quickly to convene an emergency meeting on Sunday, condemning the tariff threats as unacceptable and warning of serious consequences for trans-Atlantic relations.",
      "The episode has raised fresh questions about how much longer Europe is willing to absorb pressure from Washington in the name of a NATO alliance that appears to be bursting at the seams.",
      "Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland are facing new 10% tariffs until \u201ca Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland,\u201d the U.S. leader said Saturday, with duties increasing to 25% if a deal is not reached by June 1.",
      "It is a familiar position for European leaders, who spent much of last spring negotiating with Washington as Trump sought to reshape global trade through tariffs. The U.S. already has a framework agreement with the European Union capping tariffs at 15%, alongside a separate deal with the U.K. limiting duties to 10%.",
      "Trump did not say whether the newly threatened tariffs would override those agreements or be imposed on top of them.",
      "But the latest threats have drawn signs of fatigue and impatience with the U.S., as European leaders, long reluctant to confront Trump directly, appear newly united in defending Denmark\u2019s territory and pushing back against what they see as an unacceptable escalation.",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has often acted as an intermediary between Washington and Europe in the effort to bring an end to the war in Ukraine, while the U.K. was the first nation to strike a deal to reverse or cut some of Trump\u2019s earlier tariffs.",
      "But Starmer said Saturday that Trump\u2019s plans to impose tariffs on European allies were \u201ccompletely wrong,\u201d a rare departure from what had appeared to be a policy of U.S. appeasement that has drawn criticism from lawmakers in his own country.",
      "\u201cApplying tariffs on allies for pursuing the collective security of NATO allies is completely wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will of course be pursuing this directly with the U.S. administration.\u201d",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron, who has recently issued dire warnings about the collapse of U.S.-Europe relations, said \u201cno amount of intimidation\u201d will persuade European nations to change their course on Greenland. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson warned the E.U. would not be \u201cblackmailed\u201d by Trump, while Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re said \u201cthreats have no place among allies.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement, the eight nations threatened with tariffs said Sunday that \u201ctariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will continue to stand united and coordinated in our response,\u201d the statement said, ahead of an emergency E.U. meeting.",
      "Trump has stood firm in his belief that the U.S. requires Greenland for its national security, and has repeated assertions that Russia and China will try to seize Greenland otherwise.",
      "\u201cThere is not a thing that Denmark can do about it,\u201d Trump wrote, referring to Danish defense capabilities as \u201ctwo dogsleds as protection.\u201d",
      "European allies, for their part, argue that any security threats to Greenland should be handled together. Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen will visit Norway, the U.K. and Sweden over the next five days, the ministry said Sunday, noting that the main topic will be the security situation in the Arctic.",
      "\u201cWhat our countries have in common is that we all agree that NATO\u2019s role in the Arctic must be strengthened, and I look forward to discussing how,\u201d a statement said.",
      "The president\u2019s latest threat has called into question the European strategy of \u201cbuttering up Mr. Trump,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, told NBC News on Sunday, noting Trump\u2019s latest threats had escalated the situation from \u201cslingshot to bazooka.\u201d",
      "Even if European nations were able to come to some kind of agreement with Trump, he told NBC News, \u201che\u2019s well known for changing his mind or unleveling the playing field, and this is what they have to understand.\u201d",
      "Bociurkiw said Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who announced lower tariffs with China last week after meeting with its leader Xi Jinping, had done the \u201csmart thing\u201d by going to Beijing and \u201crisking the ire of Mr. Trump.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt shows that he\u2019s acting unilaterally,\u201d he added. \u201cI think that\u2019s the way Europe needs to go.\u201d",
      "While Europe has trodden carefully with Trump in part to avoid upsetting negotiations over the war in Ukraine, his ultimatum over Greenland \u201cmakes no difference at all\u201d to that calculation, one analyst told NBC News, because \u201cnobody had any faith in the United States\u201d to deliver.",
      "\u201cThe confirmation that the U.S. does not have a common security vision with Europe doesn\u2019t change the position of Ukraine,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cThe threats and promises that we hear from Europeans warning the U.S. that this could mean the end of NATO are ineffective because this is not something which the current U.S. leadership group values,\u201d he added.",
      "The defense of Ukraine, he said, \u201crelies on Europe recognizing its responsibility, rather than any role the U.S. might previously have had.\u201d",
      "In a sign that the two disputes could end up entangled, however, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez warned Sunday that a U.S. invasion of Greenland \u201cwould make Vladimir Putin the happiest man in the world.\u201d"

      "In a public address, Khamenei denounced Trump\u2019s earlier remarks about the protests. \u201cThe president of the United States himself encouraged the agitators,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWe consider the U.S. president a criminal, both for the casualties, for the damages, and for the slander directed at the Iranian nation,\u201d he added.",
      "Khamenei said \u201cthe Iranian nation has defeated America\u201d and security forces have rounded up key leaders behind the unrest, adding: \u201cWe have no intention of leading the country into war, but we will not let domestic criminals go [unpunished].\u201d",
      "The leader also acknowledged for the first time that \u201cthousands\u201d of people had died in the unrest. Previously, Iranian officials said hundreds had been killed.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time to look for new leadership in Iran,\u201d Trump told Politico in an interview on Saturday, after learning of Khamenei\u2019s remarks.",
      "\u201cThe man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people,\u201d he said. \u201cHis country is the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership.\u201d",
      "The brutal crackdown has left at least 3,090 dead, according to the Human Rights Activists News Agency, a\u00a0U.S.-based Iranian activist group that relies on supporters inside Iran to track the protests and monitor deaths. The organization also reported 22,123 arrests.",
      "\u201cThe Iranian regime has a bloody track record, but as the toll soars there may well be no precedent to the speed and ferocity with which it\u2019s acted this time,\u201d Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group, told NBC News in a text message responding to questions.",
      "The vast majority of the killings took place after the internet was cut on Jan. 8, human rights activists and observers say. It has yet to be restored, according to internet monitoring group NetBlocks, leaving most Iranians cut off from the outside world.",
      "Mobile phone texting services, which had also been cut, were at least partially restored, the Fars news agency, which is affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, reported on Friday.",
      "The demonstrations were sparked by economic grievances as the rial currency crashed and inflation soared, morphing into one of the biggest challenges the Islamic Republic has faced in the theocracy\u2019s 47-year history, as thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand the end of the ruling clergy.",
      "Despite the judiciary appearing to back away from executions, Ayatollah Ahmad Khatami, a hard-line cleric, demanded the execution of protesters in a fiery Friday prayer sermon in Tehran.",

      "For now, it appears that the mass killings have deterred protesters, but the regime will likely face future unrest because it has not addressed the root causes of the grievances, including the dismal economy, water shortages, electricity blackouts and restrictions on social freedoms, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve already won the battle against their people, but I think ultimately they\u2019re going to lose the war,\u201d Sina Azodi, director of the Middle East studies program at George Washington University, said in a telephone interview.",

      "The two countries have both hinted at military steps to protect their interests, and experts fear a breakdown in talks could lead to conflict.",
      "\u201cEgypt has affirmed its commitment to serious and constructive cooperation with the Nile Basin countries, based on the principles of international law, in a manner that achieves shared interests without causing harm to any party,\u201d el-Sissi continued in his post.",
